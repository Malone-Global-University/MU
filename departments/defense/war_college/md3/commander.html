      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Commander Tier is the final evolution in the War College. This is where revolutionary strategists become rulers. You will learn to lead with autocratic clarity, diplomatic precision, and world-class executive function. Every lesson is designed to help you govern an institution, a people, or a nation under your vision — while defending it from all threats foreign and domestic.
