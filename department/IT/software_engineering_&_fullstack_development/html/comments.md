## Comments

### Comments are not displayed by the browser. They are used to hide code for debugging lines one at a time, documenting your work, or leaving notes on code you changed for other engineers when working on a team.

## Example 1 - tag syntax

Here is an example of the comment tag syntax:  

<code><!-- --></code>

The "<!--" starts the comment and the "-->" Ends it.

### Example 2- full example

Here is a full example of a comment:  

<code><!-- A comment goes here--></code>

The text "A comment goes here" is only visible in source code by viewing the HTML file in a text editor. 

### Example 3 - notifications

Here is a full example of a comment notification:  

<ode><p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- write a follow up next --> </code> 

### Example 4 - Hiding HTML

Here is an example of hiding HTML:  

<code><h2>This is a heading.</h2>

<!-- <p>First paragraph </p> -->

<p>Second paragraph.</p>  </code>

The first paragraph is hidden from view until the comment tag is removed.  

You can hide one character, word, line, section, or entire pages.


### Example 5 - Inline

Here is an example of an inline comment :  

<code><p>Five, <!-- six --> , seven.</p></code>


### Example 6 - CSS syntax

Here is an example of CSS comment syntax:  

/* */

CSS comments are used to disable select parts of CSS in external stylesheets.  
If commenting out CSS that is in a HTML file you can use CSS or HTML syntax if in the <head> section. If in the <body> section you must use HTML syntax.   



### Example 7 - full example

Here is a full example of a CSS comment :  

 /* This controls CSS or the hero class id */
    .hero {
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0f2027, #203a43, #2c5364);
      padding: 5rem 2rem;
      text-align: center;
      color: #dbefff;
      text-shadow: 1px 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
    }
