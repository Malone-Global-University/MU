# Future Roadmap: Markdown-to-HTML Converter

## Introduction

The Markdown-to-HTML converter developed for Malone Global University (MGU) has evolved through three versions:

* **Version 1.0:** Minimal base script with logging.
* **Version 2.0:** Expanded Markdown features and templating.
* **Version 3.0:** Automated navigation and per-department summaries.

This roadmap outlines the proposed direction for **Version 4.0 and beyond**, highlighting improvements in functionality, automation, and integration.

Each stage builds on the previous, moving from **accuracy → customization → management → interactivity**. This trajectory aligns with MGU’s mission to provide a free, professional-quality online education system that is both accessible and future-ready.
