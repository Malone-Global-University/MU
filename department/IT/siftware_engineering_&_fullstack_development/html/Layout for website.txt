### What is Layout?

Layout is the overall look and feel of your website. It consists of what is visually seen, elements that are used, their placement, and color palette.  
Layout begins with building a consistent theme. A theme consists of HTML elements, CSS rules, and JavaScript scripts for programmability for your webpages.  

First decide your logic then decide your design. Logic is how the website and individual pages work.  


I need:


1. Header with school logo that links to homepage
2. Darkmode
3. Navbar
4. Hero displaying page subject
5. A main section for text and images
6. A footer with social media links and last updated info 


Navigation is the most important so I will write my links to my main pages now:


      <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="/community/resources">Community</a></li>
      <li><a href="/homepage">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/mission">Mission</a></li>
      <li><a href="/library/directory">Library</a></li>
      <li><a href="/department/directory">Department</a></li>
      <li><a href="/devblog/live-journal">DevBlog</a></li>

These pages exist in the root folder so the file path starts with a forward slash, /, making it an absolute relative link.
