  <p>The Northern Renaissance unfolded across Europe north of the Alps during the 15th and 16th centuries. While deeply influenced by the Italian movement, it developed its own character—rooted in realism, moral reform, and attention to everyday life. The spread of printing, trade, and scholarship carried Renaissance humanism beyond Italy’s borders, reshaping religion, art, and governance across Germany, France, England, and the Low Countries.</p>

Jan van Eyck’s mastery of oil painting introduced depth and texture unseen in earlier art.

    <h3>Religious Reform and Humanist Thought</h3>
    <p>Humanism in the North maintained a stronger theological orientation than its Italian counterpart. Thinkers like Desiderius Erasmus called for a return to ethical Christianity grounded in reason and scripture. His seminal work, <em>The Praise of Folly</em>, critiqued corruption in both church and society, prefiguring Martin Luther’s reformist agenda. The Northern Renaissance thus became both a spiritual and intellectual awakening, bridging faith and rational inquiry.</p>
