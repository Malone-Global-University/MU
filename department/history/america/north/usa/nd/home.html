<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">North Carolina was originally home to Cherokee, Tuscarora, Catawba, and other Indigenous communities. Societies relied on agriculture, hunting, fishing, and trade networks. Political organization included clans, councils, and confederacies that governed resource management and ceremonial life.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Colonization</h2>
  <p class="wide">European colonization began with English settlements in the 16th and 17th centuries, including the Roanoke Colony. Early colonial life centered on agriculture, trade, and coastal ports. Indigenous populations were displaced by disease, warfare, and land encroachment, reshaping the cultural and demographic landscape.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial and Revolutionary Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">North Carolina participated in the American Revolution with both militia and political contributions. The colony’s economy relied on small farms, plantation agriculture, and timber. Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary political structures emphasized local autonomy and laid the groundwork for statehood within the new federal system.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Civil War and Reconstruction</h2>
  <p class="wide">North Carolina seceded in 1861, joining the Confederacy. The war caused widespread disruption, and postwar Reconstruction imposed federal oversight while introducing political rights for freed African Americans. Resistance from white elites resulted in segregation, disenfranchisement, and economic control by the planter class into the 20th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor, Economy, and Industrialization</h2>
  <p class="wide">Agriculture, particularly tobacco and cotton, dominated the state economy until textile mills, furniture manufacturing, and later technology centers emerged. Labor strikes occurred in mills and factories, reflecting worker demands for wages, conditions, and union representation. Industrial diversification gradually reshaped social and economic structures.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern North Carolina</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, North Carolina balances urban growth, technology, and traditional agriculture. The Research Triangle, Charlotte, and other urban centers are economic hubs, while rural areas focus on farming and forestry. Political and cultural trends reflect a blend of Southern tradition and progressive initiatives in education, healthcare, and environmental management.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">North Carolina is known for its maritime and Appalachian culture, historical landmarks, and musical contributions such as bluegrass and jazz. Indigenous preservation, civil rights history, and labor heritage are significant for scholars examining Southern social and economic transformation. Environmental conservation, particularly of mountains and coastline, remains a policy focus.</p>
