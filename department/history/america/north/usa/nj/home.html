  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">New Jersey was home to the Lenape (Delaware) people, who practiced agriculture, hunting, fishing, and trade along rivers and coastal areas. Social, political, and spiritual structures governed community life, with extensive networks linking neighboring Indigenous groups.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Colonization</h2>
  <p class="wide">Dutch settlers established trade posts in the early 17th century, followed by English control in 1664. Colonization introduced new governance, religion, and commerce, while displacing Indigenous populations through land appropriation, disease, and conflict. Towns and ports facilitated trade and immigration.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial and Revolutionary Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">New Jersey played a central role in the American Revolution, hosting key battles and serving as a strategic corridor between New York and Philadelphia. The state’s economy included agriculture, iron production, and shipping, providing resources and manpower for the Continental Army. Loyalist and Patriot divisions shaped local politics and society.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">The 19th and early 20th centuries saw industrial growth in textiles, manufacturing, and transportation. Labor movements emerged in urban centers, addressing wages, working conditions, and union recognition. Immigrant communities, particularly Italian, Irish, and German, contributed to industrial labor and urban culture.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern New Jersey</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, New Jersey balances urban centers, suburban communities, and agricultural regions. Industries include pharmaceuticals, finance, technology, and shipping. Political engagement is high, with diverse representation and influence in regional and national governance. Environmental, educational, and infrastructural policies are central to modern state planning.</p>
</section>

  <h2>Special Interests</h2>

The state’s industrial heritage, coastal regions, and transportation networks make it a hub for commerce and culture in the Mid-Atlantic. Preservation of Indigenous and immigrant histories remains a key focus for education and scholarship.</p>
