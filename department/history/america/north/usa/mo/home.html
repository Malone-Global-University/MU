<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Missouri was inhabited by the Osage, Missouria, and other Native American groups, who practiced hunting, fishing, and agriculture along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Trade networks connected regional tribes, and social organization included clan leadership and ceremonial hierarchies. Indigenous knowledge shaped the ecology and settlement patterns of the region.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration and Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">French explorers and traders arrived in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The area was part of Upper Louisiana under French, then Spanish, and finally U.S. control after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Settlements developed along rivers, combining fur trade, agriculture, and early civic institutions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Territorial Development and Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">Missouri Territory was organized in 1812, leading to statehood in 1821 under the Missouri Compromise. This compromise highlighted tensions between free and slave states, embedding Missouri into the sectional conflicts that would culminate in the Civil War. Agriculture, particularly cotton in the southern regions, shaped early economic development.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Civil War and Social Conflict</h2>
  <p class="wide">Missouri was a border state with divided loyalties, producing both Union and Confederate forces. Guerrilla warfare, raids, and skirmishes devastated local communities. Post-war Reconstruction emphasized federal oversight, but racial segregation and economic inequality persisted, particularly affecting freed African Americans.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw growth in railroads, mining, lumber, and manufacturing. Labor disputes emerged in mines and factories, often reflecting ethnic and class tensions. Urban centers such as St. Louis and Kansas City became hubs of commerce, migration, and civic development, shaping Missouri’s modern economic profile.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Missouri</h2>
  <p class="wide">Missouri today balances urban industry, agriculture, and service sectors. Social and economic disparities remain between urban and rural areas. Politically, the state often acts as a microcosm of national trends, with contested elections and diverse policy debates. Cultural contributions include music, literature, and architecture, reflecting both Southern and Midwestern influences.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Missouri’s strategic rivers, frontier history, and role in sectional conflicts make it critical for understanding American expansion and Civil War politics. The state is also known for its cultural heritage in jazz, blues, barbecue, and innovation in transportation and commerce. Missouri exemplifies the intersection of Midwestern and Southern identities.</p>
