<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Tennessee was inhabited by Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Creek nations. Indigenous communities cultivated maize, hunted game, and traded regionally. Seasonal settlements, spiritual practices, and confederations structured life, social organization, and political alliances prior to European contact.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Settlement and Frontier Expansion</h2>
  <p class="wide">European settlers, primarily English and Scots-Irish, arrived in the 18th century. Frontier expansion led to the establishment of settlements, forts, and trading posts. Land disputes and forced removal of Indigenous peoples (including the Trail of Tears) reshaped demographics and social structures.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Plantation Economy and Slavery</h2>
  <p class="wide">Agriculture, particularly cotton, tobacco, and livestock, drove the state’s economy. Enslaved African labor was central to plantation wealth, influencing social hierarchy and politics. Tennessee’s position as a border state created economic and cultural tensions leading up to the Civil War.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Civil War and Reconstruction</h2>
  <p class="wide">Tennessee was a key Confederate state but was the first to be readmitted to the Union after the war. Battles, occupation, and emancipation transformed society. Reconstruction policies attempted integration and civil rights expansion, but resistance and segregation reshaped governance, economy, and social life.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Tennessee</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Tennessee has a diversified economy combining agriculture, manufacturing, music, tourism, and technology. Nashville and Memphis are cultural and economic hubs. Education, infrastructure, and environmental management guide development while preserving historical heritage and promoting cultural industries.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Tennessee is known for music history (country, blues, rock), Civil War heritage, Appalachian culture, and natural landscapes. Preservation of historical sites, Indigenous heritage, and cultural festivals enhances education, research, and tourism.</p>
