  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Coast Salish, Chinook, Yakama, Nez Perce, and other nations inhabited the region for millennia, establishing complex social, economic, and political systems. Fishing, hunting, agriculture, and trade along rivers, coasts, and forests defined Indigenous livelihoods and cultural practices.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration</h2>
  <p class="wide">Exploration by the Spanish, British, and later Americans occurred from the 18th century onward. Lewis and Clark’s expedition (1804–1806) mapped the interior, while fur traders, missionaries, and settlers gradually established footholds, reshaping the land and interactions with Indigenous populations.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Territorial Development and Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">Washington Territory was established in 1853, facilitating governance, land allocation, and settlement. Conflicts over land, resource access, and treaties with Indigenous nations shaped early governance. Statehood in 1889 solidified political structures, legal frameworks, and regional identity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">Timber, fishing, mining, and agriculture formed the economic base. Industrialization and railroads expanded commerce and migration. Labor movements, strikes, and union activity emerged in timber, rail, and urban industries, reflecting broader trends in labor rights and socioeconomic development.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Washington</h2>
