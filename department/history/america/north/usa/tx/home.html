<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Texas was home to Comanche, Apache, Caddo, and Karankawa nations, among others. Indigenous peoples developed hunting, agriculture, and trade networks across diverse ecosystems from plains to Gulf Coast. Social, political, and spiritual systems structured life for centuries before European contact.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Spanish and Mexican Colonization</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, establishing missions, presidios, and settlements. Mexican governance in the early 19th century promoted colonization and trade. Cultural blending, land disputes, and missionary activity reshaped Indigenous societies and created the foundation for Texan identity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Republic of Texas and U.S. Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">Texas declared independence from Mexico in 1836, forming the Republic of Texas. Annexation by the U.S. in 1845 brought statehood, boundary disputes, and involvement in the Mexican-American War. Political, economic, and social institutions were established, shaping governance and regional identity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Civil War and Reconstruction</h2>
  <p class="wide">Texas seceded in 1861 and joined the Confederacy. Battles were limited compared to other states, but the economy and society were heavily impacted. Reconstruction efforts addressed political reintegration, emancipation, and racial policies, though segregation and social hierarchies persisted.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">Cattle ranching, cotton, and later oil became central to Texas’ economy. Labor disputes, strikes, and industrialization shaped urban growth and working conditions, particularly in oil, rail, and manufacturing sectors. Migration, trade, and economic diversification transformed the state over the 20th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Texas</h2>
  <p class="wide">Texas today is a diverse economic powerhouse, with technology, energy, manufacturing, agriculture, and cultural industries. Cities like Houston, Dallas, and Austin are major hubs. Education, infrastructure, environmental management, and cultural preservation guide ongoing growth and social development.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Texas is known for its Indigenous heritage, frontier history, oil industry, cowboy and cattle culture, music, and diverse landscapes. Preservation of historical sites, cultural festivals, and natural landmarks is central to research, education, and tourism initiatives.</p>
