  <h1>History of Delaware</h1>
  <p>Small in size, vast in influence, Delaware’s history stretches from Indigenous trade to global corporate power.</p>

  <h2>General Information</h2>

  <h2>Pre-Colonial and Indigenous Foundations</h2>
  <p class="wide">Before European arrival, Delaware was home to the Lenape (Delaware) and Nanticoke peoples, whose trade routes linked the Chesapeake to the Atlantic. These communities managed forests and rivers sustainably, forming kinship-based networks rather than centralized hierarchies. Disease and European encroachment disrupted these systems, displacing entire villages by the late 17th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial Competition and State Formation</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Delaware River valley was contested among Dutch, Swedish, and English settlers. The New Sweden colony (1638–1655) left a legacy of Lutheran faith and log architecture. The English consolidated control under William Penn, linking Delaware to Pennsylvania before it became a separate entity. Its early economy revolved around agriculture and trade, sustained by enslaved Africans and indentured servants. During the Revolution, Delaware’s position between the North and South made it a borderland of mixed sympathies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrial Expansion and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">By the 19th century, Wilmington emerged as an industrial center. The DuPont Company, founded in 1802, transformed gunpowder manufacturing into a modern chemical empire. Laborers that were immigrant, Black, and female, faced severe hazards and little representation. The early 20th century saw strikes and slow reforms. Delaware’s proximity to Philadelphia encouraged union movements but also corporate lobbying to prevent them from taking root.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Delaware</h2>
  <p class="wide">Delaware’s most distinctive transformation was legal: it became a corporate haven through permissive incorporation laws passed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, more than half of Fortune 500 companies are legally headquartered there, despite employing few locals. This legal strategy turned Delaware into an invisible pillar of global capitalism. Yet economic dependency on financial registration masks fragile local communities struggling with deindustrialization and environmental contamination.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Delaware’s quiet power lies in its Chancery Court—a legal system prioritizing business disputes over criminal or civic cases. Its corporate secrecy has drawn both praise for efficiency and criticism for enabling corruption and tax evasion. Beneath the image of bureaucratic order lies the contradiction of a state whose influence exceeds its size, controlling the mechanisms of global finance while many of its residents face modest means.</p>
