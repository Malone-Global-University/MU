<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Oklahoma was originally home to various Indigenous nations, including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole. These nations had established agricultural, hunting, and trading systems. European contact brought disruption, disease, and eventual relocation of tribes from other regions during the 19th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spanish and French explorers traversed the region in the 16th and 17th centuries. Early exploration mapped rivers, trade routes, and natural resources but had limited permanent settlement. Interactions with Indigenous populations were intermittent, focusing on trade and territorial claims.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Land Runs and Settlement</h2>
  <p class="wide">The 19th century saw forced relocations of Indigenous peoples via the Trail of Tears, followed by federal land runs beginning in 1889. Settlers established towns, farms, and industries. Land allocation and property disputes were central to social and political life during this rapid settlement period.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood and Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Oklahoma became the 46th state in 1907. Agriculture and ranching dominated early economic activity, while oil discoveries in the early 20th century spurred rapid industrial growth. Cities like Tulsa and Oklahoma City became economic hubs, balancing resource extraction, manufacturing, and trade.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor and Social Movements</h2>
  <p class="wide">Labor movements arose in mining, oil, and agricultural sectors, addressing wages, working conditions, and union representation. Social and political movements also focused on Indigenous rights, civil rights, and land ownership, shaping state policies and community activism throughout the 20th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Oklahoma</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Oklahoma’s economy combines energy, agriculture, manufacturing, aerospace, and services. Urbanization, infrastructure development, and education are key state priorities. Indigenous nations maintain legal and cultural influence, while environmental and resource management challenges remain central to policy and planning.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Oklahoma is known for its Indigenous heritage, land run history, oil and energy production, and cultural festivals. Preservation of tribal histories, frontier settlements, and industrial heritage is central to educational and research initiatives in the state.</p>
