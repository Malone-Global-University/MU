  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Wabanaki Confederacy, including Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi’kmaq peoples, inhabited Maine for millennia. They relied on hunting, fishing, and small-scale agriculture, with complex social, spiritual, and political institutions shaped by the rivers, forests, and coastline.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration and Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">European contact began in the 16th century with French and English explorers. Early settlements centered on trade, fishing, and fur, often interacting with Indigenous nations through alliances and conflicts. Maine’s remote and forested environment shaped settlement patterns and economic activity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">Maine separated from Massachusetts under the Missouri Compromise in 1820. Statehood established local governance structures, courts, and land policies while promoting maritime and forest-based industries. Maine’s political culture was influenced by New England traditions of civic engagement and education.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">Timber, shipbuilding, fishing, and later paper and manufacturing dominated Maine’s economy. Labor disputes, strikes, and cooperative movements in these sectors shaped labor laws and industrial practices. Seasonal employment, migration, and evolving technologies transformed the workforce over time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Maine</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Maine blends traditional maritime and forest industries with tourism, education, and technology sectors. Portland, Bangor, and Augusta serve as cultural and economic hubs. Environmental conservation, historic preservation, and sustainable development guide state policy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Maine is known for lighthouses, lobster and seafood industry, hiking and maritime culture, Wabanaki heritage, and festivals celebrating local history and arts. Tourism, historical preservation, and ecological stewardship remain central to Maine’s identity.</p>
