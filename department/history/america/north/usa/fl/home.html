  <h1>History of Florida</h1>
  <p>From Spanish outpost to space-age frontier, Florida’s story is one of colonization, resistance, and reinvention.</p>

  <h2>Indigenous Civilizations</h2>
  <p class="wide">Before European invasion, Florida supported complex societies such as the Calusa, Apalachee, and Timucua. These groups engineered canals, mounds, and intricate trade networks. Disease and conquest under Spanish rule devastated these civilizations. Yet Indigenous resistance continued through the Seminoles, who emerged from Creek migrants and escaped Africans creating free maroon settlements deep within the swamps.</p>

  <h2>Colonial Florida</h2>
  <p class="wide">Claimed by Spain in 1513, Florida became the oldest European colony in North America. It alternated between Spanish, British, and later American control. The 18th century saw raids, slave escapes, and wars. Florida was a sanctuary for freedom seekers long before Emancipation, provoking U.S. military invasions under Andrew Jackson that destroyed maroon settlements and initiated the First Seminole War.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood and Civil War</h2>
  <p class="wide">Florida entered the Union as a slave state in 1845 and quickly seceded in 1861. During Reconstruction, African Americans briefly gained political power, but Jim Crow segregation soon reasserted white supremacy. The Great Migration drained Black labor northward while northern investment transformed Florida’s coasts into playgrounds for the wealthy.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Economy and Labor Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Florida’s postwar economy shifted toward tourism, agriculture, and real estate speculation. Migrant laborers—Haitian, Cuban, and Mexican—powered the citrus and sugar industries under exploitative conditions. The 1930s sugar strikes and later farmworker protests exposed deep racial and class divides hidden behind the tourist image. NASA’s presence at Cape Canaveral added a technological frontier but also deepened economic disparities between regions.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Florida’s geography makes it both paradise and hazard: hurricanes, rising seas, and fragile ecosystems threaten permanent settlement. Politically, it remains a bellwether of American polarization—where environmental fragility, immigration, and race intersect. Its culture embodies contradiction: freedom and control, wealth and poverty, nature and engineered escape.</p>
