  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>

These groups developed advanced agricultural systems, trade networks, and complex social and ceremonial structures. Adobe architecture, irrigation, and communal land use exemplified their sustainable adaptation to arid landscapes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Spanish Colonization</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, establishing missions, trade routes, and colonial governance. Indigenous resistance, intermarriage, and cultural exchange produced a hybrid society. Land grants, Catholic missions, and Spanish law shaped settlement patterns and local politics.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mexican and U.S. Territorial History</h2>
  <p class="wide">New Mexico became part of Mexico after 1821, then transitioned to U.S. control following the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). Territorial governance introduced new legal, economic, and political systems. Conflicts over land, Native rights, and settlement patterns influenced development through the 19th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor and Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Agriculture, ranching, and mining were economic mainstays. Labor disputes arose around land rights, mining conditions, and wages, involving both Indigenous and immigrant communities. Railroads and trade routes facilitated market expansion, while tourism, arts, and cultural industries grew in the 20th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern New Mexico</h2>
  <p class="wide">New Mexico today balances energy production, agriculture, technology, tourism, and cultural heritage. Cities like Albuquerque and Santa Fe are centers of commerce, education, and the arts. Indigenous communities maintain political and cultural influence, while environmental and water management remain pressing policy concerns.</p>
