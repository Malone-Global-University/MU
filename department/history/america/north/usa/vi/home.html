  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Colonization</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spain initially claimed the islands, followed by the Dutch, French, and Danish. Colonization established sugar plantations, enslaved African labor, and trade networks. Cultural and architectural legacies, along with conflicts over labor and land, shaped the islands’ identity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>U.S. Acquisition and Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">The islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917, becoming a U.S. territory. Governance transitioned to U.S. federal oversight, and infrastructure, military, and economic systems were developed. Residents were granted U.S. citizenship in 1927, impacting political participation and civic life.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">Sugar plantations historically dominated the economy, with enslaved labor forming the foundation of production. After abolition, wage labor, migration, and diversification shaped the workforce. Modern economies include tourism, shipping, and service industries, with labor unions influencing worker protections.</p>
</section>

  <h2>Modern U.S. Virgin Islands</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, the U.S. Virgin Islands rely on tourism, shipping, and service sectors. St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John are cultural and economic hubs. Environmental conservation, hurricane preparedness, and education programs guide development and resilience in the region.</p>
