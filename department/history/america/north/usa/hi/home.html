  <h1>History of Hawaii</h1>
  <p>From an independent Polynesian kingdom to a symbol of American empire, Hawaii’s history is one of cultural brilliance and political betrayal.</p>

  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide"><strong>Capital:</strong> Honolulu<br>
  <strong>Admitted to Union:</strong> August 21, 1959 (50th)<br>

  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Settled by Polynesians over a millennium ago, Hawaii developed a unique hierarchical society led by ali‘i (chiefs) and sustained by the kapu system, which governed conduct and environmental balance. Complex aquaculture and taro cultivation reflected ecological intelligence. Before Western contact, Hawaii was a sovereign network of chiefdoms united under King Kamehameha I in 1810—one of the few indigenous unifications in the Pacific.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonization and Overthrow</h2>
  <p class="wide">European contact began with Captain Cook in 1778, bringing trade, disease, and missionaries. The introduction of Christianity and capitalist land ownership undermined traditional governance. In 1893, U.S.-backed businessmen and marines orchestrated a coup d’état against Queen Liliʻuokalani. Despite protests and international outcry, annexation followed in 1898—an early instance of U.S. imperial expansion justified under “Manifest Destiny.”</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Sugar and pineapple plantations dominated the 20th century, owned largely by white business oligarchs known as the “Big Five.” Imported labor from Japan, China, Portugal, and the Philippines diversified Hawaii’s population but reinforced ethnic hierarchies. Labor exploitation was rampant, and profits flowed to mainland investors. After World War II, tourism replaced agriculture, commodifying native culture for global consumption.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes and Social Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Hawaii’s plantation workers organized multiethnic unions, culminating in the 1946 sugar strike, which paralyzed the islands and gave rise to the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU). This movement symbolized cross-racial solidarity against colonial capital. Subsequent political reforms broke the oligarchs’ dominance and paved the way for statehood—but under continued U.S. military control.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Hawaii</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Hawaii is a global tourism hub and military stronghold. The economy’s dependence on tourism has deepened environmental pressures and inflated living costs, displacing Native Hawaiians. The sovereignty movement seeks reparations and recognition of the 1893 overthrow as illegal. Hawaii’s beauty masks its geopolitical role as a U.S. outpost in the Pacific and a living case study of cultural resilience amid systemic occupation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Beyond tourism, Hawaii’s significance lies in its Indigenous revival—language immersion schools, land restoration projects, and Hawaiian nationalism articulate resistance to ongoing colonial structures. The Thirty Meter Telescope protests at Mauna Kea exemplify a new generation reclaiming sacred space from scientific and military encroachment.</p>
