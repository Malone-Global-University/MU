    <h1>Arkansas</h1>
    <p>Arkansas: a narrative of frontier settlement, plantation cotton in the Delta, Appalachian-influenced uplands, Reconstruction struggles, and modern rural transformation.</p>
  </section>

 <main>

<section>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Capital: Little Rock — Statehood: June 15, 1836 (25th state). State flower: Apple Blossom. State bird: Mockingbird. State tree: Pine.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous &amp; Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Indigenous cultures (Quapaw, Caddo, Osage, Tunica) occupied the river valleys and uplands. The Arkansas Delta was a fertile ecological region with long-term human habitation and networks of trade and ceremonial exchange. Indigenous ecological knowledge shaped local resource use long before colonial settlement altered landscapes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial &amp; Territorial Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">French explorers claimed the region in the 17th century; Spanish and French competing claims characterized early colonial cartography. After the Louisiana Purchase, Anglo-American settlers expanded into the territory. Early settlement patterns varied: the Delta favored plantation agriculture while upland regions (Ozarks) retained smaller farms, producing a bifurcated social economy that persists in political and cultural divisions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood &amp; Expansion</h2>
  <p class="wide">Arkansas entered the Union in 1836. The antebellum period deepened plantation slavery in the Delta, linking Arkansas to interstate cotton markets. The Civil War saw internal conflict as well as military action. Postwar Reconstruction brought temporary Black political participation and institution building, later reversed by Jim Crow laws, voter suppression, and economic retrenchment favoring white elites.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">The 20th century saw the mechanization of agriculture, the decline of small tenant farming, and the relative economic marginalization of many rural counties. The state diversified with manufacturing, poultry and food processing, and service sectors centered in Little Rock and Northwest Arkansas (Fayetteville, Springdale). Political culture has moved from New Deal Democratic dominance to modern Republican control, reflecting national realignment and rural-conservative trends.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p class="wide">Historically dependent on cotton, Arkansas now has a mixed economy: agriculture (chicken/poultry, rice), food processing, retail (large corporate presence in Northwest Arkansas), and manufacturing. Economic gains are uneven: the northwest growth corridor is prosperous while much of the Delta experiences persistent poverty and health disparities—the result of historical patterns of landownership and disinvestment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes &amp; Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Labor activism in Arkansas has been episodic: tenant farmer strikes in the early 20th century, industrial actions in textile towns, and more recent disputes in poultry processing. Racialized labor regimes, seasonal migrant labor, and anti-union political culture have constrained unified labor movements; economic transitions have polarized labor markets between low-wage processing jobs and higher-paid corporate employment in growth centers.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Delta Poverty & Agricultural Legacies</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Arkansas Delta’s history of plantation agriculture has enduring consequences: concentrated landownership, health and education disparities, and cultural legacies (music, cuisine) that are internationally influential yet locally impoverished. Policy initiatives seeking rural recovery must contend with the structural legacy of slavery and dispossession that shaped the Delta's political economy.</p>
