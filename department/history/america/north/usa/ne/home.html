<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">North Dakota was home to Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, Lakota, and other Native American communities. These groups developed sedentary villages, extensive trade networks, and complex political and ceremonial structures. The Missouri River and surrounding plains were central to agriculture, hunting, and regional exchange.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration and Fur Trade</h2>
  <p class="wide">European explorers, including Lewis and Clark, entered the region in the early 19th century. Fur traders, particularly French, British, and later American companies, established posts and trade networks, creating economic interdependence with Indigenous groups. These interactions introduced new goods, technologies, and diseases that significantly affected Native populations.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Settlement and Territorial Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Dakota Territory was organized in 1861, and settlement increased with railroads and homestead acts. Immigrants, largely from Scandinavia and Germany, established farms in fertile river valleys. Agricultural development, particularly wheat production, shaped the state’s social and economic patterns and led to the growth of towns and infrastructure.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor and Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Agriculture dominated North Dakota’s economy, with cooperative movements emerging to support farmers. Labor unrest was less violent than in mining states, but periodic disputes over wages, land, and cooperative policies shaped local politics. The state also developed energy resources and small-scale manufacturing, complementing its agricultural base.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern North Dakota</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, North Dakota balances energy, agriculture, and technology sectors. Oil extraction in the Bakken formation transformed the economy, attracting migration and investment. Urban centers like Fargo and Bismarck are regional hubs for commerce, education, and culture, while rural areas continue traditional farming. Political engagement often emphasizes local autonomy and resource management.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">North Dakota is known for its Indigenous heritage, cooperative agricultural initiatives, and natural landmarks including the Badlands and Missouri River. The state’s history provides insight into frontier settlement, resource development, and adaptation to harsh northern climates. Cultural preservation of Native and immigrant communities remains a significant focus.</p>
