  <h1>History of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands</h1>
  <p>The U.S. Minor Outlying Islands comprise small, mostly uninhabited islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. Their history encompasses discovery, scientific research, military activity, and ecological significance under U.S. administration.</p>
</section>

<main>

<section>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide"><strong>Territory Type:</strong> Unincorporated U.S. Territories<br>
  <strong>Capital / Admin Center:</strong> None (administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)<br>
  <strong>Population:</strong> 0 (permanent residents)<br>
  <strong>Major Islands:</strong> Baker, Howland, Jarvis, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Palmyra Atoll, Wake Island<br>
  <strong>Nickname:</strong> UM Territories</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Discovery and Early Use</h2>
  <p class="wide">These islands were discovered by European explorers between the 16th and 19th centuries. Initial use included guano mining, whaling stopovers, and occasional strategic military landings. Their remote location limited permanent settlement and sustained economic activity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>U.S. Administration</h2>
  <p class="wide">The U.S. formally claimed these islands in the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, primarily under the Guano Islands Act of 1856. Administration shifted over time from the Navy and territorial governance to the Department of the Interior, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service now managing most for conservation and scientific purposes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Military and Strategic Significance</h2>
  <p class="wide">During the 20th century, several islands (e.g., Johnston Atoll, Wake Island) were used for military bases, refueling stations, and missile testing. Their isolated locations provided strategic advantages for defense, communications, and operations during World War II and the Cold War.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Ecology and Research</h2>
  <p class="wide">The islands serve as critical habitats for seabirds, marine life, and coral reef ecosystems. Scientific research focuses on ecological preservation, climate impact studies, and biodiversity monitoring. Strict environmental regulations govern access and human activity to minimize disturbance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Administration</h2>
  <p class="wide">Currently, the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands are largely uninhabited and managed for conservation, research, and limited military purposes. Access is restricted, with ongoing monitoring for ecological protection, maritime security, and compliance with international treaties.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">These islands are unique for their ecological significance, isolation, and historic role in U.S. territorial expansion. Preservation efforts highlight their value for scientific research, conservation education, and understanding strategic maritime history.</p>
