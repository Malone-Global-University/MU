<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Montana was traditionally inhabited by the Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Assiniboine, and other Indigenous groups. Communities relied on bison hunting, horse culture, and seasonal migration, with complex social, political, and trade networks across the Northern Plains and Rockies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration</h2>
  <p class="wide">Lewis and Clark’s expedition (1804–1806) marked the first U.S. survey of Montana territory. French and British fur traders operated in the region, establishing trade networks with Indigenous peoples. These interactions introduced European goods, horses, and diseases, reshaping local societies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Settlement and Territorial Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">U.S. settlement expanded following the Louisiana Purchase and establishment of the Montana Territory in 1864. Mining booms in gold, silver, and copper attracted settlers and entrepreneurs, leading to the growth of towns and transportation infrastructure. Agriculture and ranching developed alongside mining, particularly in the fertile valleys.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor and Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mining and railroads dominated Montana’s economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Labor disputes, strikes, and union organizing were frequent, often clashing with company militias and federal intervention. Timber, agriculture, and energy resources complemented mining as the state’s economic base expanded.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Montana</h2>
  <p class="wide">Montana today combines agriculture, tourism, energy, and technology. Rural depopulation and resource management challenges coexist with growth in urban centers like Billings, Missoula, and Bozeman. Politically, Montana exhibits a blend of libertarian, conservative, and progressive policies, reflecting its frontier heritage and modern civic engagement.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Montana’s unique geography, including the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains, shapes outdoor recreation, conservation, and environmental policy. The state is notable for Indigenous cultural preservation, historic mining sites, and its role in the U.S. frontier narrative. Its history offers insight into resource-based economies and labor struggles in the American West.</p>
