  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Nevada was home to Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe peoples. These groups practiced seasonal hunting, gathering, and irrigation-based agriculture along rivers and oases. Social, economic, and spiritual networks governed life, with extensive trade routes linking regions across the Great Basin.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spanish and later American explorers entered the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. Initial contact brought mapping, trade, and sporadic settlement. European influence was limited until discovery of mineral resources attracted migration and investment in the mid-19th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mining and Settlement</h2>
  <p class="wide">Nevada’s economy historically centered on silver, gold, and other minerals, sparking rapid population growth in boomtowns like Virginia City. Mining infrastructure, railroads, and urban centers emerged to support extraction industries. Environmental and Indigenous land issues accompanied these developments.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor and Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mining labor disputes, wage issues, and union organizing marked Nevada’s economic development. Labor movements were often contentious due to harsh working conditions and transient populations. Later, gambling, tourism, and energy production diversified the state economy, reducing dependence on mining.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Nevada</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Nevada’s economy thrives on tourism, hospitality, mining, and energy sectors. Las Vegas and Reno are global destinations for entertainment and conventions. Political engagement emphasizes state sovereignty, resource management, and business-friendly policies. Environmental concerns and water resource management remain critical.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Nevada is recognized for its mining heritage, desert landscapes, legalized gaming, and Indigenous cultural contributions. Historic boomtowns, the Hoover Dam, and expansive public lands highlight the state’s unique economic and cultural evolution. Preservation of both Indigenous and mining histories is central to understanding Nevada’s identity.</p>
