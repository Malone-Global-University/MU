<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Indiana was originally home to Miami, Shawnee, Potawatomi, and other Algonquian-speaking tribes. Communities managed riverine and woodland ecosystems, cultivated maize, and maintained complex trade networks. European contact disrupted traditional societies through disease, displacement, and later, forced treaties.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Settlement and Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">After the Northwest Indian War and Treaty of Greenville (1795), European-American settlers from Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania migrated into Indiana. The territory was formally organized in 1800 and admitted as the 19th state in 1816. Early development centered on agriculture, river transport, and small manufacturing, with slavery prohibited but southern cultural influence present in southern counties.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">Indiana’s northern regions industrialized rapidly in the late 19th century, fueled by coal, steel, and manufacturing in cities like Gary and Fort Wayne. Labor unrest, including strikes in steel mills and railroads, marked the tension between workers and corporate owners. The state’s southern agricultural belt retained traditional patterns but gradually mechanized in the 20th century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Indiana</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Indiana maintains a diversified economy: manufacturing, logistics, agriculture, and services. Urban centers drive economic growth while rural counties face demographic decline. The state is politically influential, balancing Midwestern conservatism with pockets of progressive urban policy. Environmental management, including waterway protection and land use planning, has become increasingly prominent.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Indiana’s contributions to American culture include the Indianapolis 500, agricultural innovation, and labor organizing. Its historical position as a crossroads of migration and industry shaped Midwestern identity, balancing economic modernization with preservation of traditional rural culture. Indiana’s historical archives provide critical insight into labor movements, regional politics, and social stratification.</p>
