  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Before European arrival, Louisiana was home to Caddo, Choctaw, Natchez, and other Native American nations. Societies relied on agriculture, riverine trade, and mound-building. Social, political, and religious institutions were sophisticated and closely tied to the Mississippi River system.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Colonization</h2>
  <p class="wide">French explorers, led by La Salle, claimed Louisiana in 1682. French settlements established trade, plantations, and Catholic missions. Spanish control followed intermittently in the 18th century, influencing architecture, law, and trade networks. Both colonial powers relied heavily on Indigenous alliances and African enslaved labor.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Louisiana Purchase and Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">In 1803, Louisiana was purchased by the United States, doubling the country’s territory. Statehood followed in 1812. Early governance navigated diverse populations, French and Spanish legal traditions, and complex land claims, shaping the foundation for future economic and political development.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">Louisiana’s economy historically centered on agriculture—cotton, sugar, and later rice—supported by enslaved labor. Post-Civil War, sharecropping and tenant farming dominated. Industrial growth, shipping, oil, and port activity diversified labor structures. Labor conflicts, strikes, and union activity influenced both rural and urban employment policies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Louisiana</h2>
  <p class="wide">Modern Louisiana balances cultural diversity, including Cajun, Creole, and African American traditions, with industrial and service economies. Cities like New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport serve as hubs for tourism, education, energy, and government services. Environmental management, education, and disaster preparedness are central to contemporary policy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Louisiana is renowned for jazz music, Mardi Gras, Creole and Cajun cuisine, plantation architecture, and riverine trade. Festivals, cultural preservation, and tourism initiatives highlight Louisiana’s unique historical and social heritage, making it a focal point for studies of Southern U.S. culture and history.</p>
