  <h2>Spanish Colonization</h2>

  <h2>U.S. Acquisition and Territorial Status</h2>
  <p class="wide">Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory following the Spanish-American War (1898). U.S. administration introduced legal, political, and economic reforms, industrialization programs (e.g., Operation Bootstrap), and public infrastructure improvements. The island maintains a unique political status as an unincorporated territory.</p>
</section>

  <p class="wide">Sugar, coffee, and manufacturing sectors fueled the economy, while labor unrest and strikes in the 20th century addressed wages, working conditions, and social rights. Labor unions and political activism played key roles in shaping labor law, social programs, and nationalist movements on the island.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Puerto Rico</h2>
  <p class="wide">Puerto Rico’s modern economy combines tourism, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. Political debates on statehood, autonomy, and governance continue. Cultural preservation, environmental management, and education shape development while addressing challenges such as debt, natural disasters, and migration.</p>
</section>
