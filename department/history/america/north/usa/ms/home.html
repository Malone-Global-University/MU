</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mississippi was inhabited by the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Natchez, and other Indigenous groups. Communities relied on maize agriculture, riverine fishing, and complex trade networks along the Mississippi River. Social organization included clan systems, ceremonial hierarchies, and strategic alliances with neighboring tribes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Contact and Colonization</h2>
  <p class="wide">French explorers and settlers arrived in the late 17th century, establishing forts and trading posts along the Mississippi River. Colonial policies relied on alliances and trade with Indigenous populations. After Spanish and British influence, the territory came under U.S. control in the early 19th century, opening lands for plantation agriculture.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Slavery and the Antebellum Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mississippi’s fertile soils made it central to cotton cultivation, dependent on enslaved African labor. Planter elites dominated politics and society. The state’s wealth was concentrated in plantations, while enslaved populations faced brutal conditions. Social hierarchies and economic reliance on slavery shaped political stances leading to secession.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Civil War and Reconstruction</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mississippi seceded in 1861, joining the Confederacy. Battles, blockades, and the emancipation of enslaved populations transformed the state’s social and economic landscape. Reconstruction brought federal oversight, political participation for freedmen, and resistance from white elites, setting the stage for post-Reconstruction segregation and disenfranchisement.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor and Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Agricultural labor, particularly sharecropping and tenant farming, dominated until mechanization in the 20th century. Industrial development was slower compared to Northern states, with timber, river shipping, and small manufacturing concentrated regionally. Labor disputes were often localized but reflected broader racial and economic inequalities.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Mississippi</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mississippi faces economic, educational, and social challenges, with persistent disparities between urban and rural areas. Agriculture, energy, and service sectors are significant economic drivers. Civil rights history informs contemporary political debates, social movements, and efforts toward economic development and educational reform.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mississippi is known for its blues music heritage, cultural resilience, and historical role in shaping U.S. race relations. The state’s environmental and riverine systems provide unique ecological value, while its historical landmarks reflect centuries of Indigenous, colonial, and African American experiences.</p>
