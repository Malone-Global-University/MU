    <h1>California</h1>
    <p>California’s sweep — from rich Indigenous societies and Spanish missions to a Gold Rush economy, agribusiness, Hollywood culture, and the globalized tech economy — reveals how empire, migration, and capital shape place.</p>
  </section>

<section>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Capital: Sacramento — Statehood: September 9, 1850 (31st state). State flower: California Poppy. State bird: California Quail. Largest city: Los Angeles.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous &amp; Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Home to perhaps the most linguistically diverse Indigenous region in North America, California hosted dozens of nations with complex seasonal economies based on coastal fisheries, acorn processing, and inland hunting/gathering. Social organization ranged widely, and sustained land stewardship practices shaped fire regimes and ecosystems. These systems were catastrophically disrupted by missionization, disease, and settler colonization.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial &amp; Territorial Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spanish missionization (late 18th–early 19th centuries) reoriented Indigenous lifeways toward mission agriculture and labor, producing dramatic demographic collapse from disease and coercion. Mexican independence introduced ranchos and new land grant politics. Anglo-American conquest during the Mexican-American War (1846–48) and the 1848 Gold Rush accelerated settler colonization, dispossession, and transformative demographic change.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood &amp; Expansion</h2>
  <p class="wide">California entered the Union in 1850 as a free state, but the legal and extralegal dispossession of Indigenous peoples continued. The Gold Rush created extreme wealth concentration, boomtown economies, and entrenched patterns of racial exclusion (anti-Chinese laws, property restrictions). Over time, railroads, agribusiness, oil, and entertainment industries produced a diversified capitalist economy heavily integrated into national and global circuits.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">20th-century California became a site of mass migration (internal and international), industrialization (defense industries), and cultural production (Hollywood). The late 20th–21st century saw the rise of Silicon Valley and a tech-driven knowledge economy that massively increased regional wealth but also exacerbated inequality, housing crises, and precarious labor. Environmental politics — water allocation, wildfires, coastline development — and migration policy remain central tensions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p class="wide">California’s economy is the largest subnational economy globally, driven by technology, entertainment, agriculture, international trade, and services. But economic power is spatially concentrated; many regions suffer deindustrialization, housing unaffordability, and low-wage service employment. State revenue relies on high-income earners in tech and finance, which creates fiscal volatility tied to capital markets.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes &amp; Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">California has a rich labor history: agricultural organizing (including Cesar Chavez and United Farm Workers), Hollywood and entertainment guilds, maritime and industrial unions, and recent tech-sector labor activism (organizing among contract workers). The state has seen state-level policy responses (minimum wage increases, gig-worker debates) reflecting continuous contestation over labor standards in a diverse economy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Migration, Exclusion &amp; Racial Formation</h2>
  <p class="wide">California’s history is a story of contested belonging. From early exclusion laws targeting Chinese immigrants to internment of Japanese Americans in WWII, and current debates over immigration and sanctuary policies, the state is a crucible for national struggles over race, inclusion, and the law. These tensions shape policy, labor markets, and cultural production in distinct ways.</p>
