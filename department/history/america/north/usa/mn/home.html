<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Minnesota was originally inhabited by the Dakota (Sioux) in the south and the Ojibwe in the north, along with other tribal groups. These communities relied on fishing, hunting, wild rice cultivation, and seasonal migrations. Social organization, trade networks, and ceremonial life were closely tied to the lakes, rivers, and forests of the region.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration and Fur Trade</h2>
  <p class="wide">French and British fur traders arrived in the 17th and 18th centuries, establishing posts along the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers. Trade alliances with Indigenous communities shaped local politics and economics. European diseases and shifting trade patterns profoundly affected Native populations, setting the stage for 19th-century settlement.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Settlement and Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">Minnesota became a U.S. territory in 1849 and achieved statehood in 1858. European-American settlers, largely of Scandinavian and German origin, established farms and towns. Conflicts with the Dakota culminated in the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, which reshaped Indigenous land tenure. Agricultural expansion, particularly wheat and dairy, dominated the economy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw growth in milling, mining (iron and taconite), and transportation. Labor unrest occurred in mines, railroads, and mills, often reflecting immigrant and worker struggles for wages, safety, and union recognition. Minnesota’s labor movements contributed to progressive legislation in education, labor law, and public welfare.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Minnesota</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Minnesota has a diversified economy including agriculture, healthcare, technology, and manufacturing. Urban centers like Minneapolis and Saint Paul drive economic growth while rural areas focus on farming and natural resources. The state is politically active, often emphasizing civic participation, environmental stewardship, and progressive social policies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Minnesota is notable for its civic innovation, high-quality public education, and cultural contributions in literature, music, and the arts. The state’s natural resources, lakes, and forests underpin tourism and recreation, while its historical labor movements and immigrant communities provide valuable insight into social development in the northern Midwest.</p>
