<section>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide"><strong>Capital:</strong> Lansing<br>
  <strong>Admitted to Union:</strong> January 26, 1837 (26th)<br>
  <strong>State Bird:</strong> American Robin<br>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Michigan was historically inhabited by the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe, Odawa, Potawatomi), Menominee, and other Indigenous peoples. Communities relied on hunting, fishing, and agriculture, particularly along waterways connecting the Great Lakes. Seasonal movement and kinship networks structured social and political life.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>French Colonial Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">French explorers and traders established forts and missions in the 17th and 18th centuries, including Detroit in 1701. Fur trade networks connected the Great Lakes to Montreal and the Mississippi. French colonial policy emphasized alliances with Indigenous communities, shaping local governance, culture, and religion.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Territorial Development and Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">Michigan became a U.S. territory in 1805 and was admitted as the 26th state in 1837 after the Toledo War resolved border disputes with Ohio. Early settlement focused on agriculture and lumber, with waterways facilitating trade. The economy gradually diversified, particularly with mining in the Upper Peninsula.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">The 20th century transformed Michigan into the automotive and manufacturing powerhouse of the United States. Detroit’s automobile industry attracted domestic and international workers, including African Americans during the Great Migration. Labor unrest was frequent, with major strikes in auto, steel, and shipping industries shaping labor law, union strength, and political activism.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Michigan</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Michigan maintains a diversified economy: automotive, technology, manufacturing, and education. Urban centers face challenges of deindustrialization, population decline, and infrastructure decay, while the northern and rural regions emphasize natural resources, tourism, and agriculture. Political influence remains significant, often determining national electoral outcomes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Michigan’s unique Great Lakes geography, Indigenous heritage, and industrial history make it a focal point for studies of labor, migration, and economic transition. Detroit’s cultural influence, from Motown to innovation in design and technology, extends nationally and internationally. Environmental management, including Great Lakes conservation, is a key policy concern.</p>
