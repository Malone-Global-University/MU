<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Maryland was inhabited by the Piscataway, Susquehannock, and other Algonquian-speaking groups. Communities relied on fishing, maize cultivation, and complex trade networks along the Chesapeake Bay. Social organization was clan-based, and spiritual life was closely tied to seasonal cycles and natural resources.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial Foundation</h2>
  <p class="wide">Founded in 1632 as a proprietary colony for Lord Baltimore, Maryland was intended as a haven for English Catholics and a model of religious tolerance. Tobacco became the economic backbone, supported by enslaved Africans. Maryland’s colonial society blended planter elites, smallholders, and indentured servants, creating a hierarchical yet pluralistic social structure.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Slavery and the Revolutionary Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Maryland was a major slaveholding colony, with enslaved labor integral to tobacco plantations. During the Revolution, Maryland contributed troops and resources, balancing economic dependence on slavery with emerging revolutionary ideals. The state’s strategic position near the national capital and Chesapeake Bay made it central to wartime logistics and post-Revolution political development.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">In the 19th century, Maryland industrialized along railways and ports. Baltimore became a major shipping and manufacturing hub. Labor disputes arose in shipbuilding, coal, and railroad sectors, reflecting tensions between immigrant workers, African Americans, and management. Maryland’s divided loyalties during the Civil War reflected both economic interests and cultural proximity to the South.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Maryland</h2>
  <p class="wide">Maryland today blends suburban growth, federal employment, and urban centers. Biotechnology, defense, and education anchor the economy. Social and economic disparities persist, particularly between urban Baltimore and rural regions. Maryland remains politically influential, often acting as a bellwether for national trends while balancing progressive policies with entrenched structural inequalities.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Maryland’s strategic geography along the Chesapeake Bay and proximity to Washington, D.C., has shaped military, economic, and political history. The state is notable for its colonial heritage, role in the abolition of slavery post-Civil War, naval shipbuilding, and innovation in education and biotechnology. Maryland exemplifies the intersection of Northern and Southern culture in the United States.</p>
