  <h2>Founding and Colonial Idealism</h2>
  <p class="wide">Established in 1732 by James Oglethorpe as a refuge for debtors and a buffer against Spanish Florida, Georgia’s founding ideal mixed philanthropy and imperial defense. Initially banning slavery and large plantations, it quickly succumbed to the same economic logic as its neighbors. By mid-18th century, enslaved Africans outnumbered whites on coastal plantations producing rice, indigo, and cotton.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Revolution and Expansion</h2>
  <p class="wide">Georgia played an ambiguous role in the American Revolution, with Loyalist strongholds and frontier warfare defining its contribution. The postwar era saw massive land seizures from the Creek and Cherokee nations under the guise of treaties, culminating in the Trail of Tears. The state’s prosperity was inseparable from slavery, which shaped its economy, culture, and politics until the Civil War.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Reconstruction and Resistance</h2>
  <p class="wide">After the Civil War, Georgia became a testing ground for Reconstruction. African Americans briefly gained legislative seats and established schools, but white supremacy violently reasserted itself through the Ku Klux Klan and Democratic “Redeemers.” The 1906 Atlanta Race Riot exposed the violent fault lines beneath the “New South” rhetoric of progress.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor and Civil Rights</h2>
  <p class="wide">Industrialization in Atlanta and textile mills offered limited opportunities under strict racial hierarchies. Labor strikes in the 1930s and 1940s were suppressed through both legal and extralegal means. Yet by mid-century, Georgia birthed the modern Civil Rights Movement: Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, and John Lewis transformed moral resistance into national legislation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Georgia</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Georgia’s economy is anchored in logistics, film, and technology. Atlanta’s global identity contrasts with rural poverty and political tension over voting rights. The state stands as a microcosm of America’s contradictions — prosperity built on inequity, reform met with resistance, and history repeating through new forms of power.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Georgia’s enduring influence lies in its cultural exports — music, film, and activism. From Ray Charles to Tyler Perry, from civil rights marches to modern electoral transformations, Georgia continually redefines what the South can be. Its struggle remains between remembering and reinventing itself.</p>
