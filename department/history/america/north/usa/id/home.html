  <h1>History of Idaho</h1>
  <p>From rugged frontier lands to a mining and agricultural hub, Idaho’s history reflects resilience, exploitation, and environmental tension.</p>

  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Idaho was home to Shoshone, Nez Perce, Coeur d’Alene, and other tribes for thousands of years. These groups adapted to diverse ecological zones, from mountains to river valleys, relying on hunting, fishing, and seasonal gathering. Their social structures emphasized kinship, resource sharing, and spiritual stewardship of the land.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Exploration and Early Settlement</h2>
  <p class="wide">Lewis and Clark passed through northern Idaho in 1805–06, documenting rich landscapes and native communities. Fur trappers, missionaries, and later gold prospectors catalyzed Euro-American settlement. Conflicts over land and resources intensified, often leading to forced displacement of Indigenous peoples, including the Nez Perce War of 1877, highlighting the violent imposition of U.S. expansionist policies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mining, timber, and agriculture dominated Idaho’s 19th- and early 20th-century economy. Silver, lead, and later copper extraction attracted capital and labor, often at the cost of environmental degradation. Agricultural development relied on irrigation projects like the Minidoka Reclamation, which reshaped the Snake River plain into fertile farmland. The economy’s volatility made labor unrest frequent.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes and Social Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mining towns and logging camps saw frequent strikes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ethnic tensions surfaced between European immigrant laborers, Chinese workers, and Indigenous peoples. Labor organizing, though often suppressed violently, laid groundwork for later unions. Social conflicts were also shaped by federal land policies, water rights disputes, and debates over conservation versus exploitation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Idaho</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Idaho blends agriculture, technology, and service sectors. Boise and surrounding areas serve as administrative and commercial centers. However, economic gains are uneven; rural communities often struggle with declining populations and resource management challenges. Environmental concerns—forest fires, water scarcity, and mining runoff—remain central to the state’s future stability.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Idaho is notable for its combination of libertarian politics, outdoor recreation, and conservation efforts. It has become a national symbol of rugged individualism while also grappling with federal oversight, especially concerning endangered species and water rights. The state’s identity continues to negotiate the tension between preservation, resource exploitation, and modern economic growth.</p>
