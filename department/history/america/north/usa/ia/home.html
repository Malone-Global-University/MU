  <h1>History of Iowa</h1>
  <p>Iowa’s history reflects a transition from Indigenous stewardship and frontier settlement to agricultural dominance and political moderation in the Midwest.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Iowa was originally inhabited by the Ioway, Sioux, Meskwaki, and Sauk tribes. These communities relied on riverine ecosystems for fishing, hunting bison and deer, and cultivating maize, beans, and squash. Social organization emphasized kinship networks, seasonal mobility, and careful ecological management.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Contact and Frontier Settlement</h2>
  <p class="wide">French explorers and fur traders arrived in the 17th and 18th centuries, establishing trading posts along the Mississippi. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 brought the territory under U.S. control. Iowa became part of the Michigan, then Wisconsin, and later Iowa Territory. Euro-American settlers arrived in large numbers in the 1830s–1840s, displacing Indigenous populations through treaties and forced removal.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Iowa’s fertile prairie soils made it a leading agricultural state. Corn, wheat, and livestock shaped the economy from the mid-19th century onward. Railroads facilitated grain export to national and international markets. Industrial activity remained limited but supported agriculture, including milling, food processing, and farm equipment production.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes and Social Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Agricultural labor disputes were rare compared to industrial states, but early 20th-century strikes occurred among railroad workers and in milling industries. Immigrant communities—German, Scandinavian, and Irish—experienced tensions around cultural assimilation and labor rights. Iowa’s social conflicts often reflected debates over temperance, education, and land use rather than large-scale urban labor battles.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Iowa</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Iowa remains agriculturally dominant, with growing biofuel and renewable energy sectors. Political identity is moderate, often serving as a national bellwether in presidential politics. Rural depopulation and economic centralization present ongoing challenges, while environmental management—particularly soil and water conservation—has become critical for sustainable development.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Iowa is known for the Iowa caucuses, shaping early presidential campaigns, and for pioneering agricultural innovation. The state’s historical emphasis on education, cooperative farming, and rural civic institutions provides a unique lens on Midwest values, balancing economic modernization with community cohesion and environmental stewardship.</p>
