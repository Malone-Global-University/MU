    <h1>Alaska</h1>
    <p>From Arctic and subarctic Indigenous lifeways to Russian fur trade legacies and 20th-century resource booms — Alaska’s history reframes U.S. expansion through questions of sovereignty, environment, and extraction.</p>
  </section>

<section>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Capital: Juneau — Statehood: January 3, 1959 (49th state). State flower: Forget-me-not. State bird: Willow Ptarmigan. Largest city: Anchorage.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous &amp; Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Alaska is home to a diversity of Indigenous peoples (Inupiaq, Yup'ik, Aleut/Unangan, Tlingit, Haida, Athabascan groups) with long-standing marine and terrestrial subsistence economies, complex seasonal migrations, and rich kinship and ceremonial systems. Knowledge of sea ice, salmon runs, caribou migrations, and geopolitics of coastal networks underscores Indigenous sovereignty claims and long-term environmental stewardship that predate colonial maps.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial &amp; Territorial Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Russian exploration and the fur trade (18th–19th centuries) reoriented parts of Alaska into global commodity circuits. Russian America established forts and trading posts but depended on local Indigenous partners and coerced labor. The 1867 U.S. purchase (“Seward’s Folly”) transferred sovereignty to a government that initially underinvested in administration. The Klondike and later gold rushes temporarily intensified settler presence, while missionary and federal agents sought to assimilate Indigenous populations into U.S. legal and cultural systems.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood &amp; Expansion</h2>
  <p class="wide">Alaska Territory underwent infrastructure expansion during WWII (military bases, roads) which reshaped settlement patterns and accelerated integration into U.S. strategic planning. Statehood in 1959 occurred amid debates over resource control and federal investment. The discovery of major oil reserves (Prudhoe Bay) and the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline transformed the economy and governance dynamics — raising questions about who benefits from resource rents and how development impacts Indigenous land rights and the environment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Alaska’s modern political economy centers on resource extraction (oil, gas, mining, fisheries), military installations, and a growing tourism sector. Indigenous political resurgence — Native corporations (established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 1971), tribal governance, and land claims — has reframed power relations but also created new corporate forms that sometimes conflict with traditional governance models. Climate change poses existential threats to coastal communities and subsistence patterns, making Alaska a frontline for environmental justice debates.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p class="wide">Oil revenues (and the Alaska Permanent Fund) have funded public services and dividends, but they make the state vulnerable to price volatility. Fisheries, timber, and mining provide regional employment, while tourism is seasonal. The economic model prioritizes extraction with limited downstream manufacturing, raising deep questions about sustainable livelihoods, revenue distribution across remote communities, and long-term ecological costs.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes &amp; Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Labor history includes fisherfolk organizing, union drives in pulp and timber towns, and clashes around pipeline construction with environmental and Indigenous activists. Labor disputes often intersect with sovereignty claims: Indigenous workers simultaneously participate in and resist corporate projects that alter traditional lands. The logistical challenges of organizing across remote, dispersed populations complicate large-scale union organizing.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous Sovereignty &amp; Alaska Native Corporations</h2>
  <p class="wide">Alaska is a testing ground for new forms of Indigenous economic governance via Native corporations created under ANCSA (1971). These entities hold land and capital but operate within a corporate legal structure that can conflict with customary governance and subsistence priorities. This hybrid model raises important questions about self-determination, cultural preservation, and the commodification of Indigenous claims in neoliberal frameworks.</p>
