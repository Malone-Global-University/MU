    <h1>Colorado</h1>
    <p>Colorado’s past: Indigenous homelands of Ute and other nations, gold and silver rushes, contested water law, and a political economy balancing extraction, conservation, and a growing tech and service sector.</p>
  </section>

 <main>

<section>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Capital: Denver — Statehood: August 1, 1876 (38th state). State flower: Rocky Mountain Columbine. State bird: Lark Bunting. State tree: Colorado Blue Spruce.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous &amp; Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">The region is the ancestral territory of Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other Indigenous peoples whose seasonal mobility and trade created networks across the plains and mountains. Their knowledge of landscape and resource stewardship shaped long-term land use patterns prior to Euro-American incursions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial &amp; Territorial Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spanish claims to the region were nominal; Anglo-American expansion after the Louisiana Purchase intensified settlement pressures. The Pike’s Peak Gold Rush (1858–59) spurred massive in-migration, displacement of Indigenous communities, and rapid urban and infrastructure development. Territorial governance favored mining interests and created a political economy centered on extractive booms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood &amp; Expansion</h2>
  <p class="wide">Admitted as the “Centennial State” in 1876, Colorado rapidly developed mining towns, rail networks, and later agricultural and livestock economies. Water law (prior appropriation doctrine) and irrigation projects shaped settlement patterns and inter-basin politics. The boom-bust nature of mining created volatile local economies with accompanying social inequalities.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">20th and 21st century Colorado diversified with federal investment, tourism, outdoor recreation, aerospace, and a growing tech and service economy centered in Denver and Boulder. Conservation politics (national parks, forest management) and land-use conflicts between development and preservation are persistent. Gentrification and cost-of-living pressures concentrate wealth and create tensions between longtime residents and newcomers.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mining (historically), agriculture, oil and gas, tourism, and a modern mix of tech, aerospace, and professional services define Colorado’s economy. The state benefits from a highly educated workforce in urban centers, but this economic growth accentuates regional inequalities and strains infrastructure and housing markets.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes &amp; Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Colorado’s labor history includes mining strikes (notably the Ludlow Massacre era conflicts in nearby southern Colorado), unionization drives in construction and public sectors, and contemporary service-sector labor organizing. Environmental conflicts often intersect with labor and community interests, complicating simple binaries between jobs and protection.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2> Water Law &amp; Mountain/Urban Tensions</h2>
  <p class="wide">Colorado’s water governance (prior appropriation, interstate compacts) is a foundational political issue. Transfers of water from rural basins to growing Front Range cities, recreational water rights, and the impact of drought and climate change create recurring governance crises. How Colorado balances urban growth, rural economies, and ecological limits is central to its future trajectory.</p>
