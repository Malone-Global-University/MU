  <h1>History of Connecticut</h1>
  <p>Puritan governance, industrial precision, and financial influence — Connecticut embodies the pragmatic spirit of early New England.</p>

  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide"><strong>Capital:</strong> Hartford<br>
  <strong>Admitted to Union:</strong> January 9, 1788 (5th)<br>
  <strong>State Bird:</strong> American Robin<br>
  <strong>State Flower:</strong> Mountain Laurel<br>
  <strong>Nickname:</strong> The Constitution State</p>

<section>
  <h2>Pre-Colonial and Indigenous Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Before European settlement, the region was home to the Pequot, Mohegan, and Nipmuc peoples. The Connecticut River valley supported thriving agricultural and trading networks. European diseases and early wars—especially the Pequot War of 1636–37—devastated native populations, marking one of the earliest examples of settler colonial extermination in North America.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial and Early Governance</h2>
  <p class="wide">Connecticut’s settlers, largely Puritans from Massachusetts, established the Fundamental Orders of 1639—considered one of the first written constitutions. This early experiment in self-rule emphasized covenant theology and collective moral governance. Its prosperity grew from agriculture, shipbuilding, and the triangular trade, linking the colony to slavery through rum and sugar exports.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">The 19th century brought rapid mechanization—textiles, firearms, and clocks defined Connecticut’s identity. The Colt Armory in Hartford symbolized the merging of industry and war. Workers faced harsh conditions, leading to early unionization efforts and strikes, such as the 1912 New Haven railroad strike. The state’s wealth from precision manufacturing often masked deep class divides.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Connecticut</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Connecticut’s economy centers on finance, insurance, and aerospace technology. Hartford remains an insurance capital, yet deindustrialization has hollowed out its working-class cities. Educational institutions like Yale continue to project intellectual prestige, even as inequality challenges the state’s historical self-image as a model of order and reason.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Known for the “Yankee” legacy of thrift and innovation, Connecticut’s dense web of small towns and elite universities fostered both conservatism and reform. The state’s firearm industry, ironically, underwrote both imperial expansion and the Civil War, while later inspiring strong anti-gun activism after the Sandy Hook tragedy.</p>
