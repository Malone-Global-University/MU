</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Massachusetts was originally inhabited by the Wampanoag, Nipmuc, Massachusett, and other Algonquian-speaking peoples. Communities relied on coastal fishing, agriculture, and trade networks. Seasonal migrations and sustainable resource management shaped complex social and political structures prior to European contact.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial Settlement</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth in 1620, establishing one of the first enduring English settlements. Puritan migration to the Massachusetts Bay Colony created a rigid, religiously oriented society. Colonial Massachusetts became a hub of trade, shipbuilding, and early political experimentation, with town meetings laying the foundation for participatory governance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Revolutionary Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Massachusetts played a central role in the American Revolution, from the Boston Massacre and Tea Party to the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Boston emerged as a focal point of resistance, producing key revolutionary leaders. The state’s economy and society were profoundly disrupted, but its political institutions and civic engagement set precedents for the new nation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">In the 19th century, Massachusetts industrialized rapidly, leading in textile manufacturing, shipping, and finance. Urbanization in cities like Lowell, Worcester, and Boston created labor tensions, strikes, and early labor unions. Immigrant labor, especially Irish, Italian, and later French-Canadian communities, contributed to both economic growth and social conflicts. Progressive reforms in education, labor law, and public health emerged from these struggles.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Massachusetts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Massachusetts today is a leader in education, healthcare, technology, and finance. Boston serves as a global center of innovation and culture. Social and economic disparities exist between urban centers and rural regions. Politically, Massachusetts is often progressive, advocating environmental policy, education, and healthcare reform. Its historical legacy continues to inform civic engagement and cultural identity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Massachusetts’ legacy includes the creation of public education, early industrial innovations, abolitionist movements, and higher education institutions such as Harvard and MIT. Its Revolutionary War history, maritime trade, and intellectual culture make it a focal point for American historical study and civic experimentation.</p>
