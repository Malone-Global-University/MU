  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">South Carolina was originally inhabited by Cherokee, Catawba, and Yamasee nations. These groups cultivated crops, hunted, and maintained trade networks. Seasonal settlements and alliances structured political, economic, and cultural life prior to European contact.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Settlement and Colonization</h2>
  <p class="wide">English and French settlers arrived in the 17th century, establishing Charleston and other settlements. European colonization introduced plantation agriculture, enslaved African labor, and trade networks, which became central to the colony’s social, political, and economic structures.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Plantation Economy and Slavery</h2>
  <p class="wide">Rice, indigo, and later cotton plantations dominated the economy. African slaves were central to production, creating a rigid social hierarchy. Cultural blending and resistance shaped the region’s identity, economy, and social dynamics prior to the Civil War.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Civil War and Reconstruction</h2>
  <p class="wide">South Carolina was the first state to secede in 1860, initiating the Civil War. The state endured battles, occupation, and economic disruption. Reconstruction attempted political integration and civil rights expansion, but post-Reconstruction policies and Jim Crow laws reinforced racial segregation and social stratification.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern South Carolina</h2>
  <p class="wide">Modern South Carolina combines agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and services. Urban growth in Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville coexists with rural areas. Education, infrastructure, and environmental management shape development, while cultural heritage and historical preservation remain central.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">South Carolina is known for its colonial and Civil War history, plantation economy, coastal heritage, and cultural festivals. Preservation of historic sites, Gullah culture, and environmental landscapes supports research, education, and tourism.</p>
