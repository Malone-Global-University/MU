    <h1>Arizona</h1>
    <p>Arizona’s history spans ancient Indigenous irrigation societies, Spanish and Mexican rule, frontier extraction, and modern debates over water, immigration, and Indigenous sovereignty.</p>
  </section>

 <main>

<section>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Capital: Phoenix — Statehood: February 14, 1912 (48th state). State flower: Saguaro Cactus Blossom. State bird: Cactus Wren. State tree: Palo Verde.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous &amp; Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Longstanding Indigenous communities — Hohokam, Ancestral Puebloans, Hopi, Navajo (Diné), Tohono Oʼodham, and others — developed complex agricultural and trade networks in arid environments. The Hohokam’s canal systems around modern Phoenix demonstrate sophisticated water management adapted to desert ecologies. These societies sustained long-term place-based knowledge systems that later colonization attempted to undermine.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial &amp; Territorial Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spanish exploration and missionization connected Arizona to the northern frontier of New Spain and later Mexico. After the Mexican–American War and the Gadsden Purchase, Anglo-American settlement accelerated. Territorial governance was characterized by military engagement, land speculation, and extraction-oriented economies tied to mining and ranching. Native displacement intensified through military campaigns and coerced treaty processes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood &amp; Expansion</h2>
  <p class="wide">Statehood in 1912 coincided with the growth of urban centers and the harnessing of river systems (Salt, Gila, Colorado) for agriculture and municipal growth. The Colorado River’s reclamation projects (including Hoover Dam and the Central Arizona Project later in the 20th century) fundamentally reshaped regional demographics and political power by enabling large-scale agriculture and urbanization in the desert, but produced contested water politics that continue to structure regional conflict.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">Arizona’s modern economy mixes extractive legacies (mining), agribusiness, tourism, and a growing tech/retail sector in Phoenix and Tucson. Demographic change and migration have made Arizona a national battleground on questions of immigration policy, border enforcement, and ethnic politics. Indigenous nations continue to assert sovereignty and treaty rights, while environmental changes — drought, river allocation pressures — create long-term governance challenges.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p class="wide">Mining (copper historically), agriculture (irrigated cotton, citrus), and later aerospace and tech manufacture dominate certain regions. Growth models have relied on water-intensive development in an environment with limited renewable freshwater resources, which creates structural vulnerability and redistributive tensions between urban and rural stakeholders and between states sharing the Colorado River.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes &amp; Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Arizona’s labor history includes mining strikes, agricultural labor organizing (with strong migrant labor dimensions), and disputes in the service economy. The intersection of migration policy and labor supply creates an environment where worker protections are uneven and precarious, with enforcement and organizing constrained by immigration status and employer power.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Water Politics &amp; the Colorado River</h2>
  <p class="wide">Arizona exemplifies 20th–21st century water politics: interstate compacts, federal reclamation projects, tribal water settlements, and urban growth strategies have converged to create perennial conflicts over allocation. How water is governed reveals underlying power dynamics: which communities get priority, who pays for infrastructure, and how ecological limits are politically negotiated.</p>
