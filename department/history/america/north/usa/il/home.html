  <h1>History of Illinois</h1>
  <p>Illinois has served as a strategic corridor, industrial powerhouse, and political microcosm of the American Midwest.</p>

<section>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide"><strong>Capital:</strong> Springfield<br>
  <strong>Admitted to Union:</strong> December 3, 1818 (21st)<br>
  <strong>State Bird:</strong> Northern Cardinal<br>
  <strong>State Flower:</strong> Violet<br>
  <strong>Nickname:</strong> The Prairie State</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Illinois was historically inhabited by Algonquian-speaking groups, including the Illiniwek, Miami, and Kickapoo. River systems like the Mississippi and Illinois River facilitated trade, fishing, and agricultural cycles. Settlements reflected clan-based governance and intricate ecological knowledge of prairies and wetlands.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>French Colonial Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">The French established forts and missions along the Mississippi in the late 17th century, trading with Indigenous nations. Catholic missions sought to convert local populations while fur trade connected Illinois to Montreal and New Orleans. French governance left legal and cultural legacies, especially in the riverine settlements near modern St. Louis and Kaskaskia.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Territorial Development and Statehood</h2>
  <p class="wide">After the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Illinois passed to British, then American control. Illinois Territory formed in 1809, attracting settlers from Kentucky and the Ohio Valley. Agriculture and river trade shaped the early economy. Debates over slavery were intense; Illinois was admitted as a free state in 1818, but southern cultural influence remained, especially in the southern “Little Egypt” region.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Industrialization and Urban Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">Chicago’s emergence as a transport and manufacturing hub in the mid-19th century transformed Illinois. Railroads, meatpacking, steel, and lumber attracted domestic and immigrant labor, including Germans, Poles, Italians, and Irish. Labor unrest was frequent, exemplified by the 1886 Haymarket affair, which exposed tensions between labor, capital, and state power. Union organizing shaped Illinois’ political identity for decades.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Illinois</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, Illinois balances the economic weight of Chicago with rural agricultural regions. Finance, transportation, and education anchor the state’s economy. Social and political disparities persist; Chicago experiences concentrated poverty and segregation, while smaller towns struggle with declining populations and industrial decline. Illinois exemplifies Midwestern contradictions: innovation amid inequality, cosmopolitan culture alongside agrarian roots.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">Illinois’ unique position as a transport corridor gave it outsized political influence, producing presidents like Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama. The state is also a crucible for labor law, urban planning, and political experimentation, including strong municipal governance, progressive labor legislation, and early adoption of industrial regulations. These features make Illinois a key lens for understanding national development.</p>
