<section>
  <h2>Indigenous and Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">South Dakota was traditionally inhabited by Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux) nations, who developed hunting, gathering, and agricultural practices adapted to the plains. Seasonal migrations, spiritual practices, and intertribal alliances structured political and social life for centuries.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Exploration</h2>
  <p class="wide">European explorers, including Lewis and Clark in the early 19th century, mapped the region and engaged in trade with Indigenous nations. Fur trading posts were established, introducing European goods, diplomacy, and conflict into Sioux territories while influencing social and economic systems.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Territorial Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">South Dakota was organized as part of Dakota Territory in 1861. Settlement by homesteaders, railroad expansion, and land redistribution dramatically altered Indigenous lands and cultures. Conflict over land and resources, including resistance by Sioux groups, shaped governance and social structure.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor and Economic Development</h2>
  <p class="wide">Agriculture, livestock, and mining became central to South Dakota’s economy. Labor disputes emerged over wages, land access, and working conditions, particularly in mining and rail transport. The economy diversified in the 20th century to include tourism, services, and government employment, while rural depopulation presented ongoing challenges.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern South Dakota</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, South Dakota balances agriculture, tourism (including Mount Rushmore and Black Hills), manufacturing, and services. Urban centers like Sioux Falls and Rapid City provide economic hubs, while tribal nations maintain sovereignty and cultural influence over reservations and regional policy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">South Dakota is known for Indigenous heritage, Mount Rushmore, Badlands National Park, and Black Hills history. Preservation of archaeological sites, tribal culture, and natural landscapes supports research, education, and tourism, forming a critical part of the state’s identity.</p>
