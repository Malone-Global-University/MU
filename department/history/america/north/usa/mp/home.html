<section>
  <h2>Indigenous Chamorro and Carolinian Society</h2>
  <p class="wide">Chamorro and later Carolinian peoples inhabited the islands for millennia. Social organization, navigation, agriculture, fishing, and communal land management defined daily life. Cultural, religious, and political structures were closely tied to the environment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Contact and Colonial Rule</h2>
  <p class="wide">Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, establishing missions, trade, and colonial governance. German control occurred in the late 19th century, followed by Japanese administration before and during World War II. Each colonial power influenced land use, labor, population, and culture.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>U.S. Trusteeship and Commonwealth Formation</h2>
  <p class="wide">After World War II, the Northern Mariana Islands became a U.S. Trust Territory. In 1975, a Covenant established the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in political union with the U.S. Governance combined local cultural practices with U.S. legal and administrative structures.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economic Development and Labor</h2>
  <p class="wide">The economy relies on tourism, agriculture, and U.S. government employment. Labor systems reflect historical hierarchies, colonial legacies, and modern regulatory frameworks. Labor migration, wage disputes, and vocational programs continue to shape local social and economic structures.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Northern Mariana Islands</h2>
  <p class="wide">Today, the CNMI maintains cultural continuity while integrating with U.S. political, economic, and legal systems. Education, healthcare, tourism, and environmental management guide development. Urban centers like Saipan and Tinian serve as political, economic, and cultural hubs.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Special Interests</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Northern Mariana Islands are known for WWII historical sites, coral reefs, tropical landscapes, Chamorro and Carolinian heritage, and cultural festivals. Environmental conservation, tourism, and education initiatives support cultural continuity and global engagement.</p>
