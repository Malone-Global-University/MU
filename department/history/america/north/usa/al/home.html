    <h1>Alabama</h1>
    <p>A critical history of Alabama: from Mississippian chiefdoms to cotton oligarchies, Reconstruction struggles, and the civil rights battleground that reshaped national politics.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Capital: Montgomery — Statehood: December 14, 1819 (22nd state). State flower: Camellia. State bird: Northern Flicker (yellowhammer). State tree: Longleaf pine.

<section>
  <h2>Indigenous &amp; Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
  <p class="wide">Long before European contact the region now called Alabama hosted complex Mississippian chiefdoms (c. 800–1600 CE) — dense, agrarian communities centered on maize, mound-building, and long-distance trade. These societies sustained hierarchical political structures and ritual life; their archaeological footprint (mounds, plazas, carved shell) contradicts models that underplayed Indigenous sociopolitical complexity in the Southeast. By the time of sustained European incursions, many Indigenous groups (Choctaw, Creek/Muscogee, Chickasaw) maintained diplomatic and trade relationships that would be strained under colonial pressure and later U.S. expansion.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colonial &amp; Territorial Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">European competition (Spain, France, Britain) left Alabama a contested frontier. French colonial influence concentrated along the Gulf and rivers, but it was the later Anglo-American push—after the Revolutionary War and through treaties and coercion—that transformed land tenure. The period saw the systematic dispossession of Indigenous nations via increasingly coercive treaties and, later, forced removal (the Indian Removal era) which cleared large tracts for plantation agriculture. Territorial governance (1800s) leaned toward land speculation and investor-driven settlement, setting groundwork for plantation capitalism.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Statehood &amp; Expansion</h2>
  <p class="wide">Admitted in 1819, Alabama's rapid antebellum growth was powered by cotton and the expansion of the plantation system. Wealth concentrated in a plantation elite who depended on enslaved labor; state institutions reflected and reinforced that settlement pattern. Infrastructure — river steamboats, later railroads — integrated Alabama into global cotton markets, deepening dependency on a single export commodity and entrenching stark social hierarchies. Land policy, slavery laws, and political franchise rules all reflected a regime designed to protect planter interests.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Civil War &amp; Reconstruction</h2>
  <p class="wide">Alabama seceded in January 1861 and became a Confederate hub for provisioning and manpower. The Civil War devastated the state's economy and social fabric. Reconstruction (1865–1877) briefly reordered political power — freedpeople sought land, schooling, and political participation; Republican coalitions including Black officeholders emerged. But white supremacist counter-mobilization (paramilitary violence, legal retrenchment, the “Redemption” governments) systematically eroded these gains. By the 1880s–1901, Alabama codified segregation and voter suppression through poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation — a re-entrenchment of racial hierarchies under new legal forms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p class="wide">20th-century Alabama shifted between industrialization (textiles, steel, military contractors), continued agricultural decline, and the long struggle for civil rights. The mid-20th century placed Alabama at the center of national conscience: Montgomery bus boycott (1955–56), the Birmingham campaign (1963), and Selma marches (1965) were pivotal in pushing federal civil rights legislation. Politically, the state evolved toward a racially polarized electorate; economic policy often favored extractive investments and low-wage growth strategies. Contemporary Alabama wrestles with legacy inequalities — education, health, incarceration — even as targeted economic development projects and tech investments seek to diversify the economy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p class="wide">Historically anchored to cotton monoculture, Alabama later developed diversified manufacturing (automotive, aerospace, steel), timber, and chemical sectors. However, these gains are spatially uneven: large urban centers (Birmingham, Huntsville, Mobile) attract high-value industry while many rural counties lag. Public policy has frequently employed tax incentives and low regulation to attract investment, a model that raises questions about public revenue, labor standards, and long-term local capacity building. Income and education gaps remain profound and are deeply entangled with race and geography.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Labor Strikes &amp; Conflicts</h2>
  <p class="wide">Labor history in Alabama includes textile strikes, coal and ironworker organizing, and racially infused labor politics. The early 20th-century saw violent suppression of union drives in mining and textile towns. In the 1930s–40s labor organizing gained ground nationally, but Alabama remained difficult territory for unions due to employer resistance, anti-union laws, and the weaponization of racial divisions. Civil rights-era activism often overlapped with economic justice claims; later, plant closures and deindustrialization triggered community-level conflicts over jobs, retraining, and corporate responsibility.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Civil Rights Sites &amp; Memory</h2>
  <p class="wide">Alabama's identity in the national imagination is inseparable from the civil rights movement. Cities like Montgomery, Birmingham, and Selma host key sites (Rosa Parks' bus boycott, Birmingham jail protests, Edmund Pettus Bridge) that have become contested memory landscapes. How the state interprets and funds these sites — museums, education programs, monuments — shapes public memory and ongoing political narratives about race, reconciliation, and regional identity.</p>
