Stratigraphy is a geological and archaeological dating technique used to determine the relative ages of rock and soil layers (strata) and the objects found within them. By applying principles like superposition (older layers are at the bottom), it establishes a chronological sequence of events, indicating whether one layer or artifact is older or younger than another, though not providing an exact age in years.  
How it Works
1. Layers of Strata: The Earth's surface is composed of layers, or strata, which accumulate over time. 
2. Principles of Stratigraphic Dating: Several principles help interpret the age of these layers: 
Principle of Superposition: In undisturbed layers, the oldest strata are found at the bottom, and the youngest are at the top. 
Principle of Original Horizontality: Sedimentary layers were originally deposited horizontally. 
Principle of Lateral Continuity: Layers extend laterally in all directions until they thin out, are interrupted by an obstacle, or terminate. 
Principle of Cross-cutting Relationships: Any geological feature (like a fault or igneous intrusion) that cuts across existing layers is younger than the layers it cuts. 
Principle of Inclusions: Any rock fragment or particle found within another rock must be older than the rock containing it. 
Applications in Archaeology
Artifact Sequencing: Archaeologists use stratigraphy to determine the relative chronological order of different styles of artifacts, such as pottery or tools, found in distinct layers. 
Site Chronology: By understanding the sequence of layers at an archaeological site, scientists can place events and artifacts within a broader timeline relative to each other. 
Understanding Cultural and Environmental Change: Changes in artifact styles and the types of fossils found in different layers provide insights into cultural and environmental shifts over time. 
Relative vs. Absolute Dating
Relative Dating (Stratigraphy): Determines the order in which events or objects occurred, establishing "older than" or "younger than" relationships without providing a specific calendar date. 
Absolute Dating: Provides a specific age or time range, often in years, for an artifact or event, typically through methods like radiocarbon dating.
