<h2>Early Europe (Pre-Greeks and Romans)</h2>

<p class="wide">Before the rise of Classical Greece and Rome, Europe went through dramatic transformations during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. Farming communities replaced hunter-gatherers, monumental stone structures appeared across the landscape, and advances in metallurgy fueled new forms of trade and social organization. From megalithic builders in the British Isles to the warrior societies of Central Europe, these early cultures laid the groundwork for Celtic, Greek, and Roman civilizations.</p>

<p class="wide">Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe (c. 7000‚Äì800 BCE) witnessed the transformation of scattered hunter-gatherer groups into complex farming and trading societies. The spread of agriculture from the Near East brought permanent settlements, domesticated animals, and pottery traditions across the continent. Communities in regions like the Danube Valley, the British Isles, and the Iberian Peninsula constructed enduring monuments‚Äîsuch as Stonehenge, passage tombs, and megalithic circles‚Äîthat reveal both social organization and ritual life.</p>

<p class="wide">During the Bronze Age, advances in metallurgy enabled the production of bronze tools, weapons, and ornaments, fueling trade networks that connected Europe to the Mediterranean and the Near East. Distinct regional cultures, such as the Bell Beaker, √önƒõtice, and Urnfield traditions, arose and laid the groundwork for emerging social hierarchies, warrior elites, and long-distance exchange. These early developments in agriculture, metallurgy, and ritual practice formed the cultural foundation from which later Celtic, Greek, and Roman societies would grow.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p class="wide">Early Europe was far from isolated‚Äîit was a dynamic landscape of innovation and cultural exchange. Farming and metallurgy spread through migrations and trade, while monumental building projects reflect organized communities with shared rituals. By the end of the Bronze Age, societies across Europe had developed regional identities and complex social structures, setting the stage for the emergence of the Celts, Greeks, and Romans.</p>
