  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Elam emerged in the Iranian plateau around 2500 BCE, with city-states such as Susa, Anshan, and Awan. Early Elamites had their own language and script, distinct from Akkadian and Sumerian, and developed a complex urban society supported by agriculture and trade.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>The Elamites frequently interacted with Mesopotamian states as allies, rivals, and conquerors. They influenced and borrowed from Sumerian and Akkadian cultures, while maintaining distinct religious and political institutions.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Siwe-Palar-Khuppak</strong> ‚Äî Elamite ruler who allied with Akkad against Sumerian rivals.</li>
      <li><strong>Kutir-Nahhunte I</strong> ‚Äî Expanded Elamite influence into Mesopotamia during the Old Babylonian period.</li>
      <li>Other kings often recorded in inscriptions at Susa, though many remain unnamed or fragmentarily known.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Elamite raids and campaigns against Akkad and Ur III city-states.</li>
      <li>Periods of alliance with Mesopotamian rulers, exchanging tribute and technology.</li>
      <li>Control over trade routes connecting Mesopotamia to the Iranian plateau and beyond.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Elamite religion featured gods such as <strong>Inshushinak</strong> (chief deity of Susa), <strong>Simut</strong> (war god), and <strong>Napirisha</strong> (sky god). Temples and cults were central to political legitimacy, and some deities were adopted or syncretized with Mesopotamian gods.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Legacy</h2>
    <p>The Elamite kingdoms declined after repeated invasions by Mesopotamian empires, especially the Neo-Assyrian Empire, but persisted intermittently until conquest by the Persians. Despite political decline, Elamite culture influenced early Achaemenid administration and architecture.</p>
