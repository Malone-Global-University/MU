    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Battle of Lagash vs. Umma</strong> (c. 2450 BCE) is the earliest recorded battle in world history. 
      It was fought between two Sumerian city-states, <strong>Lagash</strong> and <strong>Umma</strong>, 
      over disputed farmland along their shared border. 
      The ruler of Lagash, <strong>Eannatum</strong>, claimed victory, 
      a triumph celebrated on the famous <em>Stele of the Vultures</em>.

    <h2>The Conflict</h2>
    <p>
      The fertile plain of <em>Gu’edena</em> (“Edge of Heaven”) was the heart of the dispute. 
      Control of irrigation canals meant control of life itself in southern Mesopotamia. 
      Repeated raids by Umma pushed Lagash into full-scale war.

    <h2>The Battle</h2>
    <p>
      Eannatum led the soldiers of Lagash, armed with spears and large rectangular shields, 
      into battle against the forces of Umma. The fighting was brutal, 
      and Lagash emerged victorious. The <em>Stele of the Vultures</em> depicts phalanx formations 
      and the aftermath of the battle, with vultures circling over fallen enemies.

    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <p>
      Victory secured Lagash’s control of the disputed farmland, 
      though the rivalry with Umma would flare up again in later generations. 
      The battle became legendary as the first documented clash of organized armies, 
      setting the stage for millennia of warfare in Mesopotamia and beyond.
