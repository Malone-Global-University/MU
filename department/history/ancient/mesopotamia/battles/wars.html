The First Recorded Battle

Battle of Lagash vs. Umma

Date: c. 2450 BCE

Location: In southern Mesopotamia, over the fertile farmland of Gu’edena (the “Edge of Heaven”).

Ruler: Eannatum of Lagash led Lagash to victory.

Record: The victory is carved on the Stele of the Vultures, one of the world’s earliest war monuments.

🪨 The Stele of the Vultures

A limestone monument found in Lagash.

Shows the phalanx-like formation of Sumerian soldiers, carrying spears and large shields.

Depicts the gruesome aftermath — vultures feasting on the bodies of the defeated Umma soldiers.

It’s both history and propaganda: proving Eannatum’s divine right and terrifying future enemies.

🌍 Why It Matters

This is the earliest evidence of a named ruler, army, and battle in recorded history.

Confirms that Sumerian city-states were already organized enough to field standing armies.

Demonstrates that wars were fought mainly over irrigated farmland and canals — the lifeblood of Mesopotamian civilization.

👉 So: the first known, recorded battle in history is Lagash vs. Umma, c. 2450 BCE, remembered through the Stele of the Vultures.
