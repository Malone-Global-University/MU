    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hammurabi, who reigned from <strong>c. 1792‚Äì1750 BCE</strong>, is one of the most famous rulers of ancient Mesopotamia. As the sixth king of the First Babylonian Dynasty, he transformed Babylon from a modest city-state into a dominant regional empire. Today, Hammurabi is remembered not just for his military conquests, but for the <em>Code of Hammurabi</em>, a comprehensive set of laws that established standards of justice and governance. His legacy continues to shape our understanding of law, society, and governance in the ancient world.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Early Life and Rise to Power</h2>
    <p>
      Hammurabi was born into the royal family of Babylon around 1810 BCE. Little is known about his early life, but he inherited the throne from his father, Sin-Muballit, in a period of relative stability. At that time, Babylon was a small city-state surrounded by larger, more powerful neighbors such as Larsa, Mari, and Eshnunna. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a combination of strategic alliances, diplomacy, and military campaigns, Hammurabi gradually expanded Babylon‚Äôs territory. He skillfully navigated conflicts among Mesopotamian city-states and established Babylon as a central hub of politics, trade, and culture in southern Mesopotamia.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Conquests and the Expansion of Babylon</h2>
    <p>
      Hammurabi‚Äôs reign was marked by military strategy and administrative acumen. He conducted campaigns against rival city-states including Larsa, Eshnunna, Mari, and Elam. By defeating these powers, he consolidated control over much of Mesopotamia, creating a unified Babylonian Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      While his army was key to expansion, Hammurabi also emphasized diplomacy. Treaties, political marriages, and economic agreements helped maintain peace and stability within his empire. The growth of Babylon under his rule laid the groundwork for its long-term prominence as a political and cultural center.
    </p>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>The Code of Hammurabi</h2>
    <p>
      Hammurabi‚Äôs most enduring achievement is the <strong>Code of Hammurabi</strong>, one of the earliest known legal codes in human history. Carved onto a large stone stele, the code contained <strong>282 laws</strong> covering a wide range of topics including family, property, trade, labor, and crime. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The code is famous for the principle of <em>lex talionis</em>, often summarized as <strong>"an eye for an eye"</strong>. Punishments and penalties were carefully prescribed and often depended on the social status of the parties involved, reflecting the hierarchical structure of Babylonian society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond punishment, the Code of Hammurabi emphasized fairness, accountability, and the protection of the weak, such as widows, orphans, and debtors. It served both as a legal framework and as a statement of the king‚Äôs role as the guardian of justice.
    </p>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Administration and Society</h2>
    <p>
      Hammurabi‚Äôs influence extended beyond law and military conquest. He reformed the administrative structure of Babylon, strengthening central governance and improving tax collection. He also invested in infrastructure, including the construction of canals, temples, and city walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Hammurabi, Babylon became a center of learning, trade, and cultural development. Merchants, artisans, and scribes thrived under a system that balanced regulation with opportunity. This administrative sophistication helped Babylon maintain stability and prosperity long after Hammurabi‚Äôs death.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Hammurabi died around 1750 BCE, but his legacy endured for centuries. The Code of Hammurabi influenced later legal systems across the Near East and even inspired aspects of modern law. More than a collection of laws, it provides historians with a window into Babylonian society, social hierarchies, and values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Hammurabi is remembered as both a conqueror and a lawgiver‚Äîa ruler who combined military skill with a vision of justice. His reign represents a defining moment in human history, where law, order, and civilization began to take form in the ancient world.
