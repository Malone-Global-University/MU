      <h1>The Amorites — From Nomads to Kings</h1>
      <p>c. 2200 – 1700 BCE — From tribal wanderers of the western highlands to the rulers of Mesopotamia, the Amorites shaped the transition from Sumerian city-states to the age of Babylon.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Gutian Interregnum (c. 2150–2100 BCE)</h2>
      <p>After the collapse of the Akkadian Empire, Gutian tribes from the Zagros Mountains dominated the Euphrates valley. Their loose control led to famine and disunity across Sumer. Independent rulers such as <strong>Gudea of Lagash</strong> restored peace and prosperity locally, while <strong>Utu-hengal of Uruk</strong> defeated the last Gutian king, <strong>Tirigan</strong>, ending their rule.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Third Dynasty of Ur (Ur III, c. 2112–2004 BCE)</h2>
      <p><strong>Ur-Nammu</strong>, once governor of Ur, overthrew Uruk’s supremacy and founded a centralized Sumerian empire. Five kings ruled in succession, emphasizing <em>administration, trade, and temple construction</em> over conquest. The <strong>Ziggurat of Ur</strong> was built in this era, now over 4,000 years old. Heavy taxation and divine kingship caused unrest, while climate change and Amorite migrations weakened the state.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Fall of Ur and the Rise of the Amorites (c. 2004 BCE)</h2>
      <p>The Ur III Empire collapsed when <strong>Elamite forces</strong> sacked the city of Ur. At the same time, <strong>Amorite tribes</strong> from the western highlands (modern Syria and Canaan) pushed into Mesopotamia. Once seasonal migrants, they began settling permanently and slowly merged with the local population.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Amorite Expansion and Integration (c. 2000–1800 BCE)</h2>
      <p>The Amorites established or absorbed city-states across the Near East in <strong>three major waves</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Palestine and the Levant</li>
        <li>Syria — including Ebla, Nari, Yamhad, Qatna, and Ekallatum</li>
        <li>Mesopotamia — including Isin, Larsa, and Babylon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Over time, Amorite rulers adopted Sumerian and Akkadian traditions, becoming indistinguishable from the local peoples. The most prominent Amorite kingdom emerged at <strong>Mari</strong> on the Euphrates.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Kingdom of Mari (Sim’alite Dynasty, c. 1830–1760 BCE)</h2>
      <p>Founded by <strong>Yaggid-Lim</strong>, Mari flourished under his son <strong>Yahdun-Lim</strong> through irrigation and trade. Conflict arose from overexpansion and rivalry with neighboring Amorite and Assyrian states. <strong>Shamshi-Adad I</strong>, an Amorite conqueror, seized Assyria and later took Mari after Yahdun-Lim’s assassination. His sons ruled a vast realm from <strong>Ekallatum</strong> to <strong>Aleppo (Yamhad)</strong>, maintained through diplomacy and marriage alliances.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Decline of Shamshi-Adad’s Realm (c. 1776 BCE)</h2>
      <p>Upon Shamshi-Adad’s death, his sons <strong>Ishme-Dagan</strong> and <strong>Yasmah-Addu</strong> proved ineffective. Internal rivalries shattered their empire. <strong>Zimri-Lim</strong>, possibly a descendant of the earlier Mari rulers, retook the city and restored prosperity for a brief period.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Regional Conflict and the Rise of Babylon (c. 1760 BCE)</h2>
      <p>As trade routes collapsed, warfare erupted between Mari, Eshnunna, Larsa, Isin, and Babylon. Alliances shifted constantly. Initially allies, Mari and Babylon turned to conflict. In the end, <strong>Hammurabi of Babylon</strong> conquered Mari (~1761 BCE), integrating it into his empire. The Amorite period culminated in Babylonian dominance — a new, unified Mesopotamia ruled by Amorite kings.</p>

      <h2>Comparison: Amorites vs. Assyrians</h2>
      <p>Although the Amorites once ruled Assyria under <strong>Shamshi-Adad I</strong>, they were not the same people. The Amorites were western Semitic tribes who migrated into Mesopotamia, while the Assyrians were eastern Semitic natives centered on the city of <strong>Assur</strong>. Their cultures blended over time, but their origins and identities remained distinct.</p>

      <p><strong>In summary:</strong> The Amorites and Assyrians were related through language and geography but distinct in origin and development. The Amorites introduced new dynasties across Mesopotamia, while the Assyrians built the powerful empire that later dominated the Near East.</p>
