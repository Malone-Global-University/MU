      <h2>I. Origins and Rise of Sargon (c. 2350–2330 BCE)</h2>
      <p><strong>Lugalzagesi controls Sumer</strong> — Before Akkad’s ascent, Lugalzagesi of Umma briefly unified the Sumerian city-states.</p>
      <p><strong>The Legend of Sargon’s Birth</strong> — According to later inscriptions, Sargon’s mother, a temple priestess, set him adrift in a basket on the river. He was rescued and raised by a gardener.</p>
      <p><strong>Service under Ur-Zababa</strong> — As cupbearer to the king of Kish, Sargon gained royal trust and insight into administration.</p>
      <p><strong>The Dream and Betrayal</strong> — Sargon’s dream of destiny frightened Ur-Zababa, who attempted to have him killed. Sargon escaped and later rose to power.</p>
      <p><strong>Unification of Sumer</strong> — Sargon overthrew both Ur-Zababa and Lugalzagesi, establishing a new capital at Akkad and creating a centralized state.</p>

      <h2>II. Expansion and Administration (c. 2330–2300 BCE)</h2>
      <p><strong>Conquest and Control</strong> — Sargon reportedly fought 34 battles, conquering cities such as Akkad, Ur, Lagash, Umma, Nippur, and Uruk, defeating 50 local rulers.</p>
      <p><strong>Elam Subjugated</strong> — Akkadian forces briefly extended into Elam to the east.</p>
      <p><strong>Enheduanna at Ur</strong> — Sargon appointed his daughter as high priestess of Nanna, making her the first recorded author in human history.</p>
      <p><strong>Economic Centralization</strong> — Temples became repositories of wealth and centers of accounting, taxation, and trade under imperial oversight.</p>
      <p><strong>Integration of Secular and Religious Power</strong> — Sargon’s system fused local priesthoods with imperial bureaucracy, reinforcing loyalty through religious legitimacy.</p>

      <h2>III. The Successors of Sargon</h2>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>IV. Zenith under Naram-Sin (c. 2254–2218 BCE)</h2>
      <p><strong>Imperial Peak</strong> — Naram-Sin, Sargon’s grandson, brought the empire to its greatest extent, conquering Elamite Awan, Ebla, and Mari.</p>
      <p><strong>Diplomacy and Marriage Alliances</strong> — Tied distant regions together through political marriages and trade treaties.</p>
      <p><strong>Deification of Naram-Sin</strong> — Proclaimed himself a god, depicted with a horned crown; the first Mesopotamian ruler to claim divinity during his lifetime.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>V. Decline and Collapse (c. 2210–2190 BCE)</h2>
      <p><strong>After Naram-Sin</strong> — Following his death, widespread rebellion and famine weakened Akkadian control.</p>
      <p><strong>Shar-Kali-Sharri’s Reign</strong> — The empire fragmented under pressure from internal strife and external enemies.</p>
      <p><strong>“Curse of Akkad” Poem</strong> — A literary reflection blaming divine wrath and hubris for the empire’s downfall.</p>
      <p><strong>Environmental Stress</strong> — Archaeological evidence points to a severe drought or regional climate shift affecting Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and Egypt around this time.</p>
      <p><strong>The Gutian Invasion</strong> — Mountain tribes from the Zagros seized Akkad, delivering the final blow to the world’s first empire.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>The Akkadian Empire pioneered the model of centralized imperial rule, standardized taxation, and imperial ideology later emulated by Babylon and Assyria. Its rulers introduced the concept of divine kingship and left behind the world’s first named author, Enheduanna. Though it fell, Akkad’s legacy defined Mesopotamian civilization for centuries.</p>
