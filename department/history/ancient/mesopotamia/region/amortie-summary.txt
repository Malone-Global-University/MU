it captures the transitional era between the collapse of the Sumerian Ur III dynasty and the rise of Babylon under Hammurabi. You’ve basically summarized 400 years of Mesopotamian political realignment in one timeline. Let’s refine and organize your notes into a clean, chronological synthesis with brief context under each phase so it reads like a historical overview for your website’s “Amorites” page.

The Amorites — From Nomads to Kings (c. 2200 – 1700 BCE)
1. Gutian Interregnum (c. 2150–2100 BCE)

After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, Gutian tribes from the Zagros mountains dominated the Euphrates valley.

Their loose control led to famine and disunity across Sumer.

Local rulers (Ensi) like Gudea of Lagash restored peace and prosperity independently.

Utu-hengal of Uruk defeated the last Gutian king Tirigan, restoring Sumerian autonomy.

2. The Third Dynasty of Ur (Ur III, c. 2112–2004 BCE)

Ur-Nammu, governor of Ur, overthrew Uruk and founded a centralized Sumerian empire.

Five kings ruled in succession, focusing on administration, trade, and temple building, rather than conquest.

The famous Ziggurat of Ur dates from this period (~4100 years old).

Heavy taxation, loss of local autonomy, and new deified kingship generated internal resentment.

Climate change and drought weakened the state, while Amorite tribes increased in number along the western frontier.

3. The Fall of Ur and the Rise of the Amorites (c. 2004 BCE)

The empire fell when Elamite armies sacked Ur.

Amorite tribes, semi-nomadic peoples from the western highlands (Syria–Canaan), contributed to the chaos.

Initially seasonal migrants, they began settling in Mesopotamia, eventually becoming part of local city populations.

4. Amorite Expansion and Integration (c. 2000–1800 BCE)

Amorites established or took over many city-states in three main waves:

Palestine

Syria (Ebla, Nari, Yamhad, Qatna, Ekallatum)

Mesopotamia (Isin, Larsa, Babylon)

Over time, Amorites became indistinguishable from the Mesopotamians they ruled.

The most prominent Amorite kingdom arose in Mari, a major trade hub on the Euphrates.

5. The Kingdom of Mari (Sim’alite Dynasty, c. 1830–1760 BCE)

Founded by Yaggid-Lim, whose son Yahdun-Lim made Mari wealthy through trade and irrigation projects.

Expansion triggered conflict with neighboring Amorite and Assyrian powers.

Shamshi-Adad I, an Amorite who seized Assyria, conquered Mari after Yahdun-Lim’s assassination (~1796 BCE).

His sons ruled a vast realm from Ekallatum to Aleppo (Yamhad) through alliances and marriages.

Capitals: Assur → Shubat-Enlil (modern Tell Leilan).

6. Decline of Shamshi-Adad’s Realm (c. 1776 BCE)

After Shamshi-Adad’s death, his sons Ishme-Dagan and Yasmah-Addu failed to maintain control.

Rivalry and incompetence fractured the empire.

Zimri-Lim, possibly related to earlier Mari rulers, reclaimed Mari and ruled during a final period of prosperity.

7. Regional Conflict and the Rise of Babylon (c. 1760 BCE)

Trade routes collapsed; warfare spread between Mari, Eshnunna, Larsa, Isin, and Babylon.

Alliances shifted constantly — Mari at times allied with, and later opposed, Babylon.

Ultimately, Hammurabi of Babylon conquered Mari (~1761 BCE), integrating it into his empire.

With this, the Amorite era culminated — the Amorites were now kings of the most powerful state in Mesopotamia.
