  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>In the late 3rd millennium BCE, the fertile plains of Sumer were dotted with rival city-states. Into this mosaic of power stepped <strong>Sargon of Akkad</strong>, a man whose humble origins remain shrouded in myth — a foundling set afloat in a basket, a cupbearer who seized destiny.</p>
    <p>From his new capital, <em>Agade (Akkad)</em>, Sargon built an army unlike anything Mesopotamia had seen before, one loyal to him rather than to a city-temple. This shift in political structure marks the dawn of empire.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>The Rise of Empire</h2>
    <p>Sargon’s campaigns united Sumer, extended into Elam, and reached as far as Syria and Anatolia. Trade routes opened, tribute flowed, and Akkadian language spread as the new diplomatic standard.</p>
    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sargon of Akkad</strong> — founder and conqueror, ruling for over 50 years.</li>
      <li><strong>Enheduanna</strong> — Sargon’s daughter, high priestess of Ur, and the world’s first named author, composing hymns to Inanna/Ishtar.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notable Battles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conquest of Uruk and Ur — breaking Sumerian resistance.</li>
      <li>Wars in Elam — eastward expansion into highlands.</li>
      <li>Campaigns into Syria and Anatolia — securing trade in metals and timber.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deities in the Empire</h3>
    <p>The Akkadians honored both Sumerian and Semitic gods, blending traditions. <strong>Ishtar (Inanna)</strong> became the patron of kingship and war, while <strong>Shamash</strong> (sun god) and <strong>Enlil</strong> retained their ancient prestige.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Collapse and Legacy</h2>
    <p>After Sargon’s death, his grandsons faced revolts, invasions, and famine. The empire weakened under pressure from the <strong>Gutians</strong>, mountain tribes who toppled Akkadian rule around 2154 BCE.</p>
    <p>Though short-lived, the Akkadian Empire established the blueprint for later powers: centralized bureaucracy, standing armies, and the ideology of universal kingship.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>The Akkadian Empire pioneered the model of centralized imperial rule, standardized taxation, and imperial ideology later emulated by Babylon and Assyria. Its rulers introduced the concept of divine kingship and left behind the world’s first named author, Enheduanna. Though it fell, Akkad’s legacy defined Mesopotamian civilization for centuries.</p>
