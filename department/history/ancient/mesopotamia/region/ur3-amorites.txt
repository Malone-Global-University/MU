The Amorites and the Neo-Sumerians (Ur III dynasty) lived back-to-back in Mesopotamian history, and their relationship marks the turning point between the Sumerian age and the Babylonian age.

Here‚Äôs a clear, structured comparison you can use both for study and for your website.

üß© Amorites vs. Neo-Sumerians (Ur III Dynasty)
Category	Neo-Sumerian / Ur III	Amorites
Time Period	c. 2112 ‚Äì 2004 BCE	c. 2000 ‚Äì 1700 BCE
Origins	Indigenous Sumerian revival after Gutian rule; based in southern Mesopotamia (Ur, Uruk, Lagash)	Western Semitic pastoral tribes from Syria-Canaan migrating east into Mesopotamia
Political Nature	Centralized bureaucracy ‚Äî empire ruled from Ur with governors (ensi) in each province	Decentralized city-states ‚Äî Amorite warlords and clans seized local power (Isin, Larsa, Mari, Babylon)
Economy & Society	Highly organized state economy; labor and taxation managed by temple and palace archives	More flexible, market-based trade networks; pastoral and mercantile integration
Religion	Focus on traditional Sumerian gods (Nanna, Enlil, Inanna); kings claimed semi-divine status	Adopted Sumerian-Akkadian gods; promoted Amurru, the Amorite tribal deity, alongside Marduk and others
Language & Writing	Sumerian as the written language of government and scholarship	Akkadian (Semitic) became the standard written and spoken language
Government & Law	Founded by Ur-Nammu; issued the Ur-Nammu Law Code (precursor to Hammurabi‚Äôs)	Continued legal traditions; culminated in Hammurabi‚Äôs Code ‚Äî evolution from Ur III system
Cultural Emphasis	Monumental architecture (Ziggurat of Ur), art, mathematics, scribal education	Administrative continuity, but emphasis on urban renewal and diplomatic statecraft
Military & Expansion	Defensive, maintaining borders through garrisons; limited conquests	Expansionist; absorbed old Sumerian cities and spread influence through alliances and war
Downfall	Collapsed due to drought, internal rebellion, Amorite incursions, and Elamite invasion (2004 BCE)	Gradual assimilation ‚Äî Amorite dynasties merged into Babylonian and Assyrian states
Historical Legacy	Last flowering of Sumerian civilization ‚Äî ‚ÄúNeo-Sumerian Renaissance‚Äù	Laid foundation for the Old Babylonian Period ‚Äî transition to Semitic Mesopotamia
üèõÔ∏è In Summary

Ur III represents the final phase of Sumerian rule ‚Äî centralized, bureaucratic, and written in Sumerian.

The Amorites mark the beginning of the Semitic Babylonian era ‚Äî diverse, dynamic, and linguistically Akkadian.

The fall of Ur III directly opened the door for Amorite migration and state formation.

In cultural continuity: the Amorites inherited the Ur III system, not destroyed it ‚Äî they simply recast it in a new linguistic and ethnic mold.





Chronologically and causally, the fall of Ur III (~2004 BCE) is effectively the starting point for Amorite political dominance in Mesopotamia.

Here‚Äôs how you can present it clearly:

Key Idea

The Neo-Sumerian / Ur III dynasty was the last strong Sumerian state, centered on Ur.

Collapse factors: drought, internal unrest, rebellions, Amorite incursions, and Elamite invasion.

Consequence: power vacuum in southern and northern Mesopotamia.

Result: Amorite tribes began establishing dynasties in city-states like Isin, Larsa, Mari, and Babylon.

How to Word It in Your Timeline

‚ÄúThe fall of Ur III marked the end of the Neo-Sumerian renaissance and the beginning of the Amorite Kingdom. Amorite tribes, initially semi-nomadic western Semites, settled in Mesopotamia, founded new dynasties, and gradually blended into local populations, setting the stage for the Old Babylonian period.‚Äù

Key Points for Comparison

Ur III: centralized, bureaucratic, Sumerian language, ziggurats, temple-focused administration.

Amorites: decentralized city-state rule, Akkadian language, flexible trade networks, emphasis on diplomacy and military alliances.

Continuity: Amorites adopted administrative, legal, and religious frameworks from Ur III ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt invent them.

If you want, I can rewrite your Amorites HTML page so the first section explicitly frames it as ‚ÄúFall of Ur III ‚Üí Beginning of the Amorite Kingdom‚Äù and flows naturally into Amorite expansion, Mari, and eventually Hammurabi. This would make the narrative historically tight and chronological.
