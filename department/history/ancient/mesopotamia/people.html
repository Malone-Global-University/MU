  <section class="content-section">
   <h2>Sargon of Akkad (c. 2334‚Äì2279 BCE)</h2>

<p>
Often called the world‚Äôs first great empire-builder, Sargon rose from humble origins (legend says he was abandoned as a baby in a basket, much like Moses later) to found the Akkadian Empire. He united the Sumerian city-states under his rule and extended power across Mesopotamia and beyond. His dynasty lasted for about 150 years, setting a model for later empires.
</p>

<h2>Hammurabi of Babylon (c. 1792‚Äì1750 BCE)</h2>

<p>
Best remembered for the Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest known written legal systems. Hammurabi strengthened Babylon into a dominant kingdom and portrayed himself as a just ruler chosen by the gods. His laws reveal much about Mesopotamian daily life, class divisions, and ideas of justice.
</p>

<h2>Gilgamesh (possibly c. 2800‚Äì2500 BCE)</h2>

<p>
The semi-legendary king of Uruk who became the hero of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the world‚Äôs oldest surviving epic poem. Whether Gilgamesh was a real historical ruler or a mythologized memory of one, his story reflects Mesopotamian values: kingship, the struggle for immortality, and the bond of friendship.
</p>

<h2>Enheduanna (c. 2285‚Äì2250 BCE)</h2>

<p>
Daughter of Sargon of Akkad and the world‚Äôs first known named author. She served as high priestess of the moon god Nanna in Ur and composed hymns that praised the goddess Inanna. Her writings combined religion, politics, and personal devotion, influencing Mesopotamian literature for centuries.
</p>

<h2>Ashurbanipal of Assyria (c. 668‚Äì627 BCE)</h2>

<p>
  King of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, known both for his ruthlessness in war and for his scholarship. He assembled the Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh, one of the greatest collections of cuneiform texts, preserving Mesopotamian myths, science, and history ‚Äî including the Epic of Gilgamesh.
</p>

<h2>Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (c. 605‚Äì562 BCE)</h2>

<p>
The most famous Neo-Babylonian king, remembered for military conquests, monumental building projects (including the Ishtar Gate and possibly the Hanging Gardens), and his role in biblical history. Under his reign, Babylon became the most dazzling city of the ancient Near East.
</p>

<h2>Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254‚Äì2218 BCE)</h2>

<p>
Grandson of Sargon, remembered as the first Mesopotamian ruler to declare himself a god while alive. His ‚ÄúVictory Stele‚Äù shows him wearing a horned crown, trampling enemies ‚Äî a symbol of both his empire‚Äôs peak and its arrogance. His reign also saw rebellions and signs of decline.
</p>

Ashurnasirpal II (c. 883‚Äì859 BCE)

A powerful Assyrian king who expanded the empire with brutal campaigns and built a magnificent capital at Nimrud. His palace reliefs vividly depict battles, hunting, and rituals ‚Äî giving us unmatched insight into Assyrian ideology and royal propaganda.
