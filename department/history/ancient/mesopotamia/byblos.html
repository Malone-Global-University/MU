  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Byblos began as a Neolithic fishing village around 5000 BCE on the coast of present-day Lebanon. Its natural harbor made it a gateway for maritime trade. Over time, it evolved into a powerful Bronze Age city, known to the Egyptians as "Kbn" or "Gubal."</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Byblos grew rich from trade, especially in timber and papyrus, which gave the city its Greek name. It became a central link between Egypt and the Levant, with Egyptian pharaohs commissioning temples and palaces in the city.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ahiram of Byblos ‚Äî a king whose sarcophagus features one of the earliest Phoenician inscriptions.</li>
      <li>Egyptian Pharaoh Sneferu ‚Äî one of the earliest rulers to establish timber trade with Byblos.</li>
      <li>Phoenician priests of Baalat Gebal ‚Äî custodians of the city‚Äôs temples and trade agreements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Connections</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Early trade partnerships with Old Kingdom Egypt, exporting cedar wood and importing gold and papyrus.</li>
      <li>Construction of monumental temples to Baalat Gebal, the city‚Äôs patron goddess.</li>
      <li>Integration into successive empires: Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenistic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>The chief deity of Byblos was <strong>Baalat Gebal</strong>, ‚ÄúLady of Byblos,‚Äù worshiped alongside Baal and other Phoenician gods. Egyptian influence introduced new cultic practices, blending local and foreign traditions.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>Byblos‚Äô prominence declined after the rise of other Phoenician ports such as Tyre and Sidon. It remained occupied through Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine times, though as a regional rather than international power. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
