    <h2>Ur I: Early Dynastic Period (c. 2600‚Äì2300 BCE)</h2>
    <p>Ur I represents the city's emergence as a prominent Sumerian city-state. Local kings established political authority and religious institutions, with temples dedicated to <strong>Nanna (Sin)</strong> and early administrative systems.</p>

    <section class="content-section" id="origins1">
      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>Ur grew along the Euphrates River, leveraging fertile lands and trade routes. This period saw the development of early cuneiform writing and urban governance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" id="rise1">
      <h2>Rise and Achievements</h2>

        <li>Creation of early Sumerian administrative records.</li>
        <li>Development of trade networks across southern Mesopotamia.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" id="fall1">
      <h2>Decline</h2>
      <p>The city‚Äôs dominance waned due to the rise of other Sumerian city-states and external pressures, eventually leading to Akkadian domination.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" id="historiography1">
      <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>
      <h3>What We Know</h3>

        <li>Ur I was a religious and economic center with local kingship.</li>
        <li>Archaeology shows early monumental architecture and cuneiform records.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What We Assume</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Political control extended over surrounding villages and towns.</li>
        <li>Trade and agriculture sustained the city‚Äôs growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>

  <section class="content-section" id="ur2">
    <h2>Ur II: Minor Period (c. 2300‚Äì2112 BCE)</h2>
    <p>Ur II was a quieter era following Akkadian domination. While minor dynasties ruled locally, the city did not achieve major political or architectural milestones. This period bridges Ur I and the more prominent Ur III dynasty.</p>

    <section class="content-section" id="origins2">
      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>Ur II emerged after Akkadian control collapsed, with local rulers maintaining continuity of religious and civic traditions, though at a reduced scale.</p>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" id="fall2">
      <h2>Decline</h2>
      <p>Ur II lacked centralized power or major building projects. Its limited prominence set the stage for the resurgence under Ur III.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Exact dynastic succession, rulers, and daily life details are scarce.</li>

  <section class="content-section" id="ur3">
    <h2>Ur III: Neo-Sumerian Empire (c. 2112‚Äì2004 BCE)</h2>
    <p>The Ur III dynasty represents a renaissance of Sumerian civilization. Ur-Nammu and his successors revived political authority, law, and monumental architecture, making Ur the center of administration, culture, and religion.</p>

    <section class="content-section" id="origins3">
      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>After the collapse of Akkadian and Gutian control, Ur-Nammu rose as governor and established the Third Dynasty of Ur, reaffirming Sumerian traditions while consolidating political power.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" id="rise3">
      <h2>Rise and Achievements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Centralized bureaucracy managing grain, livestock, and labor.</li>
        <li>Construction of the Great Ziggurat and major temple complexes.</li>
        <li>Legal code of Ur-Nammu, one of the earliest in history.</li>
        <li>Expansion of Ur's influence through military campaigns and alliances.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Figures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ur-Nammu</strong> ‚Äî Founder of Ur III, lawgiver, and administrative reformer.</li>
        <li><strong>Shulgi</strong> ‚Äî Expanded territory, promoted deification, and sponsored literature and religious projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Ibbi-Sin</strong> ‚Äî Last king, struggled against Elamites and Amorites, marking the dynasty‚Äôs collapse.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
      <p>Ur III rulers emphasized devotion to <strong>Nanna (Sin)</strong> and linked kingship to divine authority. Ziggurats served religious, political, and economic functions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" id="fall3">
      <h2>Decline</h2>
      <p>By 2004 BCE, Ur III fell to Elamite invasions and internal unrest. The Neo-Sumerian Empire collapsed, leaving the city reduced in political influence but still inhabited.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" id="historiography3">
      <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

        <li>Ur III was a highly organized state with monumental architecture and extensive records.</li>
        <li>Kings claimed divine authority and enacted legal codes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What We Assume</h3>
