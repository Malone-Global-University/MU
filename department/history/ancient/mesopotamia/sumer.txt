Sumer was not an empire—it was a region in southern Mesopotamia (modern-day southern Iraq) composed of city-states. Each city-state functioned independently, with its own ruler, government, and patron deity. Examples of important Sumerian cities include Ur, Uruk, Lagash, Eridu, Nippur, and Kish.



Each city-state had its own ruler, often called lugal (meaning “king”) or ensi (meaning “governor” or “priest-king”).

Sumer had many rulers over time, sometimes overlapping because each city-state had its own leadership.

Notable rulers in Sumer include:

Alulim – Legendary first king of Eridu (according to the Sumerian King List).

Gilgamesh – King of Uruk, famous in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

Ur-Nammu – Founded the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112–2095 BCE) and created one of the earliest law codes.

Lugal-Zage-Si – King of Umma and later ruler over much of Sumer just before Sargon.

Sumer vs Akkad

Sumer = collection of independent city-states.

Akkad = Sargon’s empire that conquered Sumer around 2334 BCE. Sargon united Sumer and Akkad under one rule, creating the first known empire in history.

Sumer was ruled by local kings before Sargon, and the “empire” comes only after Sargon conquered these city-states.

Early Dynastic Period (c. 2900–2334 BCE)

Eridu (one of the oldest cities)

Alulim – Legendary first king, said to have ruled for thousands of years (mythical).

Other early kings – Listed in the Sumerian King List, mostly semi-legendary.

Uruk

Enmerkar – Early legendary king.

Lugalbanda – Mythical hero-king.

Gilgamesh (c. 2600 BCE) – Historical king of Uruk, famous in literature.

Ur

Ur-Nanshe – Founder of Lagash dynasty influence.

Lagash

Ur-Nanshe – Early king who strengthened the city-state.

Eannatum – Expanded Lagash’s influence over neighboring cities (c. 2450 BCE).

Umma

Lugal-Zage-Si (c. 2350 BCE) – King of Umma, later conquered most of Sumer before Sargon.

End of Sumerian Independence

Sargon of Akkad (c. 2334 BCE) – Conquered Sumer and Akkad, creating the first empire.

After Sargon, Sumerian city-states were no longer independent but became provinces in the Akkadian Empire.

Key takeaway:

Sumer = collection of city-states, each with its own king.

Akkad/Sargon = first empire to unify them under one ruler.

Legendary rulers (like Gilgamesh) show the blend of myth and history in early Sumer.
