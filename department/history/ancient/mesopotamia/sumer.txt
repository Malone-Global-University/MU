Sumer was not an empire—it was a region in southern Mesopotamia (modern-day southern Iraq) composed of city-states. Each city-state functioned independently, with its own ruler, government, and patron deity. Examples of important Sumerian cities include Ur, Uruk, Lagash, Eridu, Nippur, and Kish.

Who ruled Sumer?

Each city-state had its own ruler, often called lugal (meaning “king”) or ensi (meaning “governor” or “priest-king”).

Sumer had many rulers over time, sometimes overlapping because each city-state had its own leadership.

Notable rulers in Sumer include:

Alulim – Legendary first king of Eridu (according to the Sumerian King List).

Gilgamesh – King of Uruk, famous in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

Ur-Nammu – Founded the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112–2095 BCE) and created one of the earliest law codes.

Lugal-Zage-Si – King of Umma and later ruler over much of Sumer just before Sargon.

Sumer vs Akkad

Sumer = collection of independent city-states.

Akkad = Sargon’s empire that conquered Sumer around 2334 BCE. Sargon united Sumer and Akkad under one rule, creating the first known empire in history.

So, Sumer was ruled by local kings before Sargon, and the “empire” comes only after Sargon conquered these city-states.
