  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Kassites were a little-known people from the Zagros Mountains, east of Mesopotamia. After the Hittite sack of Babylon around 1595 BCE, the region fell into chaos. In this power vacuum, the Kassites gradually assumed control, establishing themselves as rulers of Babylon by the mid-16th century BCE.</p>
    <p>Unlike conquerors who swept in and destroyed, the Kassites adopted Babylonian culture wholesale. They preserved Sumerian-Akkadian traditions while introducing their own names, gods, and administrative practices.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>The Rise of Kassite Babylon</h2>
    <p>The Kassite dynasty proved remarkably durable. For four centuries (c. 1595‚Äì1155 BCE), they provided stability to Babylonia even as other Mesopotamian powers rose and fell. They did not expand as aggressively as Hammurabi‚Äôs Babylon but focused on internal order, temple restoration, and diplomacy.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Agum II</strong> ‚Äî Early Kassite ruler credited with restoring Babylon‚Äôs temples and religious life after the Hittite raid.</li>
      <li><strong>Karaindash</strong> ‚Äî Established monumental building projects and solidified Kassite kingship.</li>
      <li><strong>Kurigalzu I and II</strong> ‚Äî Engaged in warfare with Assyria and Elam, founding a new capital at Dur-Kurigalzu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wars with <strong>Assyria</strong> over borderlands in northern Mesopotamia.</li>
      <li>Struggles with <strong>Elam</strong> to the east, a recurring theme in Babylonian history.</li>
      <li>Dur-Kurigalzu‚Äôs founding as a fortified capital to project Kassite power.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deities and Religion</h3>
    <p>The Kassites introduced new gods, such as <strong>Shuqamuna</strong> and <strong>Shumalia</strong>, their divine protectors, but they also elevated Babylon‚Äôs own chief deity <strong>Marduk</strong>. Under the Kassites, Marduk‚Äôs supremacy was fully institutionalized, ensuring Babylon‚Äôs status as the spiritual capital of Mesopotamia.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>By the late 12th century BCE, the Kassite dynasty faced increasing pressure from rivals. The Assyrians pushed southward, while the Elamites mounted devastating raids. Around 1155 BCE, the Elamites invaded Babylon, captured its treasures‚Äîincluding the statue of Marduk‚Äîand ended Kassite rule.</p>
    <p>The Kassites faded into history, absorbed by surrounding peoples. Yet their dynasty‚Äôs long rule ensured Babylon‚Äôs survival and cultural dominance for centuries after.</p>

    <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

    <h3>What We Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Kassites ruled Babylon for about four centuries‚Äîlonger than any other dynasty in Mesopotamian history.</li>
      <li>They founded Dur-Kurigalzu, a major new capital with ziggurats and palaces.</li>
      <li>They institutionalized the worship of Marduk as the supreme god.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Assume</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Kassites adopted Babylonian cuneiform and language quickly, leaving their own tongue poorly documented.</li>
      <li>They may have ruled less directly outside of Babylonia, relying on alliances and vassals.</li>
      <li>Dur-Kurigalzu may have been as much a symbolic statement of Kassite identity as a practical seat of government.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Where exactly did the Kassites originate, and what was their early culture like before Babylon?</li>
      <li>Why did their dynasty endure so long compared to others in Mesopotamia?</li>
      <li>How deeply did Kassite gods and traditions penetrate Babylonian society beyond the royal court?</li>
    </ul>
