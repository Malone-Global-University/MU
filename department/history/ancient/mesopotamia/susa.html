  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Founded around 4200 BCE, Susa lies in today‚Äôs southwestern Iran, near the Zagros foothills. Its location gave access to both Mesopotamian lowlands and Iranian highlands, making it a natural hub for trade and politics. The Elamites made Susa their capital by the 3rd millennium BCE.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Susa became the ceremonial and political heart of Elam. Rivaling Mesopotamian powers, Elamite kings built temples, ziggurats, and palaces. Later, under Persian rule, Susa gained new grandeur as one of the Achaemenid Empire‚Äôs four capitals, alongside Persepolis, Pasargadae, and Ecbatana.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shilhak-Inshushinak</strong> ‚Äî Elamite king who expanded Elamite influence and built extensively at Susa.</li>
      <li><strong>Ashurbanipal</strong> ‚Äî Assyrian king who famously sacked Susa in 647 BCE.</li>
      <li><strong>Darius I (the Great)</strong> ‚Äî Persian ruler who chose Susa as his administrative capital and ordered the construction of the great Apadana palace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Elamite control of Susa as their capital (3rd‚Äì1st millennium BCE).</li>
      <li>Repeated conflicts with Mesopotamian powers (Akkad, Ur III, Babylon, Assyria).</li>
      <li>Destruction by Ashurbanipal in 647 BCE, remembered as a devastating cultural loss.</li>
      <li>Transformation under the Achaemenids into an imperial capital with monumental palaces and administrative archives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Susa‚Äôs central deity was <strong>Inshushinak</strong>, god of the city and the underworld. Temples dedicated to Inshushinak and other Elamite gods stood alongside later Persian religious monuments, reflecting centuries of cultural layering.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>Susa‚Äôs prominence waned after the fall of the Achaemenids. It endured through Seleucid, Parthian, and Sassanian times, but its political weight diminished. Eventually, the city declined in the early Islamic centuries, leaving behind vast ruins that testify to its long and layered history.</p>
