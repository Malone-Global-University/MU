  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Assyria grew around the city of <strong>Ashur</strong> on the upper Tigris. At first, it was not an empire but a network of <strong>merchant colonies</strong> trading tin, textiles, and silver across Anatolia (modern Turkey). The Old Assyrian period reflects a mercantile people building wealth and contacts rather than waging conquest.</p>
    <p>Over centuries, Assyria transformed: from merchant city-state to warrior kingdom, then to a world-dominating empire whose armies reshaped the Near East.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Old Assyrian Period -->
  <section class="content-section" id="old-assyrian">
    <h2>Old Assyrian Period (c. 2000‚Äì1700 BCE)</h2>
    <p>The Old Assyrian era was defined by <strong>trade colonies</strong> known as <em>karum</em>, especially at Kanesh in Anatolia. Merchants left thousands of clay tablets documenting contracts, taxes, and caravan routes.</p>
    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Erishum I</strong> ‚Äî Expanded Assur‚Äôs authority and organized merchant networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Shamshi-Adad I</strong> ‚Äî Briefly created a regional kingdom, incorporating Mari and much of northern Mesopotamia.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deities</h3>
    <p>The god <strong>Ashur</strong> emerged as the divine patron, later equated with kingship itself.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Middle Assyrian Period -->
  <section class="content-section" id="middle-assyrian">
    <h2>Middle Assyrian Empire (c. 1392‚Äì934 BCE)</h2>
    <p>The Middle Assyrian period marked the shift from traders to warriors. Assyria built a disciplined military and began subjugating neighbors in northern Mesopotamia, Syria, and Anatolia.</p>
    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ashur-uballit I</strong> ‚Äî Declared independence from Mitanni, establishing Assyria as a great power.</li>
      <li><strong>Tiglath-Pileser I</strong> ‚Äî Expanded Assyria to the Mediterranean; famous for campaigns in Anatolia and Phoenicia.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notable Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wars with the <strong>Mitanni</strong> to break free from vassalage.</li>
      <li>Expansion into the Levant, challenging Egypt‚Äôs influence.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>Ashur was now seen as a war god demanding expansion. Kings ruled as his earthly representatives, fighting to fulfill his will.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Neo-Assyrian Empire -->
  <section class="content-section" id="neo-assyrian">
    <h2>Neo-Assyrian Empire (911‚Äì609 BCE)</h2>
    <p>This was Assyria at its height: the first true <strong>military superpower</strong> of the ancient world. Iron weaponry, professional armies, siege engines, and brutal deportations made Assyria feared across the Near East.</p>
    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ashurnasirpal II</strong> ‚Äî Ruthless conqueror; founded Kalhu (Nimrud) as a new capital.</li>
      <li><strong>Tiglath-Pileser III</strong> ‚Äî Revolutionized the army and expanded Assyrian control from Egypt to Iran.</li>
      <li><strong>Sargon II</strong> ‚Äî Founded a new capital, Dur-Sharrukin.</li>
      <li><strong>Sennacherib</strong> ‚Äî Destroyed Babylon, campaigned in Judah; famous for his palace at Nineveh.</li>
      <li><strong>Esarhaddon</strong> ‚Äî Conquered Egypt briefly.</li>
      <li><strong>Ashurbanipal</strong> ‚Äî Last great king; collected the vast library of Nineveh.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Battles and Campaigns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Repeated wars with Babylon, sometimes allies, sometimes enemies.</li>
      <li>Conquests of Israel, Judah, Phoenicia, and Egypt.</li>
      <li>Use of psychological warfare and mass deportations to control vast populations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>Ashur remained supreme, but other gods like <strong>Ishtar</strong> (war and love) and <strong>Nabu</strong> (wisdom and writing) also flourished. Kingship was inseparable from divine command.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>By the late 7th century BCE, Assyria was overstretched. Rebellions in Babylon, attacks from Medes and Persians in the east, and the rise of Neo-Babylon under Nabopolassar spelled doom.</p>
    <p>In 612 BCE, a coalition of Babylonians and Medes sacked Nineveh. By 609 BCE, Assyria had vanished as an independent state.</p>

  <!-- Historiography -->
  <section class="content-section" id="historiography">
    <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

    <h3>What We Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Assyrians developed one of the world‚Äôs first professional armies.</li>
      <li>They pioneered siege warfare, iron weapons, and mass deportations as imperial policy.</li>
      <li>The Library of Ashurbanipal preserved texts that inform much of what we know about Mesopotamia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Assume</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Assyrian brutality may have been exaggerated by enemies, but their own inscriptions boast of terror tactics.</li>
      <li>Trade and culture may have been as important as war in sustaining their empire.</li>
      <li>Religious ideology drove expansion as much as economics or politics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How did everyday Assyrians perceive the empire‚Äôs constant wars?</li>
      <li>What was life like in deportee communities spread across the empire?</li>
      <li>Would Assyria have endured longer without the combined assault of Babylonians and Medes?</li>
    </ul>
