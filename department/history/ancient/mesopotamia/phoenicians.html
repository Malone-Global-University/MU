  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Phoenicians emerged from the coastal cities of modern-day Lebanon, Syria, and northern Israel. Early city-states such as Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos developed around 1550 BCE, leveraging their location for maritime trade and resource exploitation, particularly cedar wood, purple dye, and metals.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Expansion</h2>
    <p>Phoenician city-states became wealthy through trade, colonization, and skilled craftsmanship. Their influence spread across the Mediterranean, founding colonies such as Carthage, C√°diz, and Malta.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hiram I of Tyre</strong> ‚Äî Strengthened Tyre and provided resources for Solomon‚Äôs Temple.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethbaal</strong> ‚Äî King of Tyre during Carthaginian expansion.</li>
      <li>Unnamed merchants and navigators ‚Äî instrumental in establishing trade networks and colonies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Maritime Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Development of long-distance trade networks with Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and beyond.</li>
      <li>Founding of Carthage (c. 814 BCE), which later became a major Mediterranean power.</li>
      <li>Innovations in shipbuilding, navigation, and mapmaking, allowing extended maritime voyages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Phoenician religion was polytheistic, with city-specific gods such as <strong>Baal</strong> (storm god), <strong>Astarte</strong> (fertility goddess), and <strong>Eshmun</strong> (healer). Temples and sacrifices played central roles in city-state politics and trade legitimacy.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>By the 4th century BCE, Phoenician city-states gradually lost independence under successive empires: Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and eventually Hellenistic rule following Alexander the Great. Carthage persisted as a Phoenician cultural and economic center until the Punic Wars.</p>
