      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The conflict between <a href="../cities/lagash.html">Lagash</a> and <a href="../cities/umma.html">Umma</a> marks the earliest known
        territorial war in history. At its heart was a fertile strip of land called <em>Gu’edena</em>—“the Edge of Heaven.”
        Lagash, under the dynasty of Ur-Nanshe, claimed control of the region, while Umma resisted, sparking a struggle
        that would last centuries. The most famous episode was recorded by <a href="../rulers/eannatum.html">Eannatum of Lagash</a>
        on the <em>Stele of the Vultures</em>.

      <h2>Reconstructed Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        The dispute began when rulers of Umma violated an agreement and cultivated fields belonging to Lagash. In
        response, Lagash’s kings mobilized their citizen-soldiers, organized into phalanx-like formations. The Stele of
        the Vultures shows ranks of armored Lagash warriors advancing in unison, trampling foes underfoot while their
        king leads from the front.
      </p>
      <p>
        After defeating Umma, Eannatum dedicated boundary markers and carved laws in clay cones to prevent future
        violations. Yet, Umma’s resistance never fully ended, and the conflict over Gu’edena continued in cycles for
        generations.

        <li>Shows the early use of <strong>organized infantry formations</strong>, as depicted on the Stele of the Vultures.</li>
        <li>Highlights the fusion of <strong>law and warfare</strong>, with boundary agreements formalized by inscription.</li>
        <li>Set the stage for continued rivalry among Sumerian city-states, shaping Mesopotamian geopolitics.</li>

      <h2>Comparative Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike the Kish–Elam and Uruk–Kish conflicts, the Lagash–Umma war was less about expansion and more about legal
        ownership of land. It provides historians with the first clear example of war tied directly to property rights,
        contracts, and territorial sovereignty.
