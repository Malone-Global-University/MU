      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Battle of Carchemish, fought in <strong>605 BCE</strong> on the banks of the Euphrates, was one of the most decisive engagements in Near Eastern history.
        The Neo-Babylonian crown prince <a href="nebuchadnezzar.html">Nebuchadnezzar II</a> clashed with the Egyptian army of Pharaoh Necho II, which was supporting the last remnants of the Assyrian Empire.
        Babylon’s victory permanently ended Assyria’s political existence and cemented Babylon’s place as the dominant power in the Near East.

      <h2>Reconstructed Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        After the destruction of Nineveh, the Assyrian Empire was in its death throes. Its surviving forces rallied at Carchemish with the backing of Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt, who hoped to prevent Babylonian domination.
        Nebuchadnezzar II, then crown prince of Babylon, marched swiftly westward and confronted the Egyptian-Assyrian coalition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The battle ended in a decisive Babylonian victory. The Babylonian Chronicles describe Egypt’s army as being shattered, with survivors retreating south toward their homeland.
        Assyria ceased to exist as a political entity, and Egypt permanently lost influence over Mesopotamian affairs.

      <h2>Comparative Notes</h2>
      <p>
        The Battle of Carchemish stands alongside earlier watershed conflicts such as <a href="sargon-vs-lugalzagesi.html">Sargon’s victory over Lugalzagesi</a> and <a href="naram-sin-vs-lullubi.html">Naram-Sin’s triumph over the Lullubi</a>.
        Like them, Carchemish reshaped regional politics and inaugurated a new era of empire.
