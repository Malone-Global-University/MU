    <section>
      <p>
        The Battle of Qarqar is conventionally dated to **853 BCE** (mid-9th century BCE). It is recorded in the Assyrian Kurkh (Shalmaneser III) inscription,
        which describes a major encounter between the Assyrian army and a large coalition of Levantine rulers led by Hadadezer of Damascus and
        including an identified contribution from an Israelite king commonly read as ‚ÄúAhab.‚Äù Modern historians regard the engagement as
        strategically indecisive but notable for the scale of the coalition opposing Assyria. <sup>[1]</sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Qarqar stands out because an Assyrian royal stele gives a detailed ‚Äî if propagandistic ‚Äî enumeration of allied kings, troop numbers,
        and captured booty. The ‚ÄúTwelve Kings‚Äù label in Assyrian rhetoric signals a broad anti-Assyrian alliance rather than a compact unified command.
        While Assyria‚Äôs inscription boasts of victory, the lack of immediate Assyrian consolidation in the region suggests the battle produced a stalemate.<sup>[2]</sup>
      </p>

      <h3>Why this matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It is one of the earliest well-documented examples of a multi-state coalition resisting an imperial advance.<sup>[3]</sup></li>
        <li>The Kurkh inscription provides an extrabiblical reference to several Levantine rulers (notably Ahab of Israel), anchoring biblical and Assyrian chronologies.<sup>[4]</sup></li>
        <li>Shows the military importance of chariots, cavalry, and massed infantry in the early Iron Age Levant. <sup>[5]</sup></li>
      </ul>

  </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Historical context</h2>
      <p>
        In the mid-9th century BCE Assyria, under Shalmaneser III, was expanding westward into Syria and the Levant. Local rulers ‚Äî Aramean, Phoenician, Israelite,
        Ammonite and others ‚Äî faced the choice of submission or resistance. At Qarqar, a broad array of regional powers joined to check Assyrian advance.<sup>[6]</sup>

      <h3>Principal actors (as listed in the Kurkh inscription)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neo-Assyrian Empire</strong> ‚Äî King <em>Shalmaneser III</em>, leading the Assyrian army. <sup>[7]</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Levantine coalition</strong> ‚Äî led by <em>Hadadezer</em> (called Adad-idri in Assyrian) of Damascus and including rulers such as <em>Irhuleni</em> of Hamath,
          an identified figure rendered ‚ÄúAhab‚Äù (Israel), and several Phoenician and Transjordanian leaders (Arvad, Ammon, Qedar, Quw√™, Irqanatu, etc.). <sup>[8]</sup></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sources & evidence</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Kurkh / Shalmaneser III inscription (Kurkh Monolith):</strong> the primary Assyrian narrative listing the campaign and the allied kings. <sup>[9]</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Archaeology & regional texts:</strong> settlement destruction layers and local annals that provide context but do not duplicate the full battle narrative. <sup>[10]</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary scholarship:</strong> modern reconstructions and critical editions that assess numbers and biases in the royal text. <sup>[11]</sup></li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Campaign narrative (reconstructed)</h2>
      <p>
        The following is a cautious reconstruction that balances the Assyrian inscription with modern analysis:
      </p>
      <h3>1. Assyrian advance into Syria</h3>
      <p>Shalmaneser III campaigns west from the upper Tigris toward the Orontes basin to secure cities and subdue hostile polities. <sup>[12]</sup></p>

      <h3>2. Coalition forms</h3>
      <p>Regional rulers muster forces ‚Äî infantry, chariots, horsemen, and camel contingents ‚Äî to oppose the Assyrian column. The Kurkh text emphasizes large numbers contributed by each king. Modern scholars caution these figures are propagandistic. <sup>[13]</sup></p>

      <h3>3. Battle at Qarqar</h3>
      <p>Fierce fighting ensues on the plain near Qarqar (Tell Qarqur area). Assyrian relief language claims heavy enemy losses and captured booty, while the persistence of Levantine polities after the engagement implies no decisive strategic loss for the coalition. <sup>[14]</sup></p>

      <h3>4. Aftermath</h3>
      <p>Although Shalmaneser reports destruction of Qarqar and triumph, the coalition states remain politically viable and Assyria‚Äôs westward control does not immediately follow. Shalmaneser campaigns in Syria repeatedly in following years, indicating continued contestation. <sup>[15]</sup></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Forces, weapons & tactics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chariots:</strong> Heavy use by both sides as mobile shock units; the Kurkh text cites thousands (likely exaggerated). <sup>[16]</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Infantry & cavalry:</strong> Large infantry bodies supported chariot action; the Levantine coalition also employed light cavalry and camel contingents (noted in some translations). <sup>[17]</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Terrain & logistics:</strong> The Orontes plain provided a battleground suitable for chariot manoeuvre but required reliable supply lines and reconnaissance to avoid ambush. <sup>[18]</sup></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Political & ideological dimensions</h2>
      <p>
        The Kurkh inscription is both record and royal propaganda: Assyrian inscriptions typically inflate enemy numbers and minimize setbacks. The alliance at Qarqar, whether fully unified or loosely coordinated, shows that local rulers preferred coalition defense rather than piecemeal submission ‚Äî an important political signal in the face of imperial expansion.<sup>[19]</sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Immediate consequences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Assyrian claims of victory did not produce lasting annexation in Syria at this time; western resistance continued. <sup>[20]</sup></li>
        <li>The Kurkh record became a vital chronological and historiographical source for Levantine and biblical studies. <sup>[21]</sup></li>
        <li>Shalmaneser‚Äôs repeated campaigns after Qarqar indicate the battle was part of a longer contest rather than a conflict terminus. <sup>[22]</sup></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <p>
        Start with the Kurkh (Shalmaneser III) inscription (English translations and museum plates), then consult modern critical commentaries (Livius, specialist articles) that discuss scribal exaggeration and the inscription‚Äôs place in Assyrian royal rhetoric. <sup>[25]</sup>
