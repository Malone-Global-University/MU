      <p>
        Around 1200 BCE, the Eastern Mediterranean experienced a wave of invasions and migrations led by groups collectively known as the <strong>Sea Peoples</strong>. 
        These groups, originating possibly from the Aegean, Anatolia, and other maritime regions, attacked and settled along the coasts of the Levant, Egypt, and Cyprus. 
        Their raids and conquests coincided with the <strong>Bronze Age Collapse</strong>, disrupting established trade networks and contributing to the downfall of major powers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Historical context</h2>
      <p>
        The Late Bronze Age was an interconnected world of empires and city-states bound by trade and diplomacy. 
        A combination of climate change, famine, internal rebellions, and external invasions weakened these systems. 
        The Sea Peoples entered this fragile environment, overwhelming already weakened states.
      </p>
      <h3>Principal actors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sea Peoples:</strong> Groups identified in Egyptian inscriptions, including the Peleset (Philistines), Sherden, Shekelesh, Denyen, and Tjeker.</li>
        <li><strong>Egypt:</strong> Defended its borders during the reigns of Merneptah and Ramesses III, ultimately surviving but weakened.</li>
        <li><strong>Hittite Empire:</strong> Collapsed under combined pressures of famine, internal revolt, and Sea Peoples attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Levantine city-states:</strong> Many coastal cities destroyed or resettled by new populations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sources & evidence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Inscriptions of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, detailing the battles against the Sea Peoples.</li>
        <li>Archaeological destruction layers at sites such as Ugarit, Ashkelon, and Hattusa.</li>
        <li>Philistine pottery and settlement remains in Canaan.</li>
        <li>References in the Egyptian Merneptah Stele.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Campaign narrative (reconstructed)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Initial movements:</strong> Sea Peoples begin migrating by sea and land into Anatolia, Cyprus, and the Levant.</li>
        <li><strong>Destruction of city-states:</strong> Coastal centers such as Ugarit fall, cutting trade routes.</li>
        <li><strong>Egyptian resistance:</strong> Ramesses III defeats Sea Peoples invasions by land and sea, preventing settlement in Egypt itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Settlement in Canaan:</strong> Groups such as the Philistines establish themselves along the Levantine coast, altering the regionâ€™s demographic and cultural landscape.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Military organization</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sea Peoples utilized advanced seafaring vessels for raids and mass migrations.</li>
        <li>Mixed forces of warriors, families, and settlersâ€”indicating both invasion and colonization.</li>
        <li>Use of iron weapons during a transitional period from bronze technology.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Political and ideological significance</h2>
      <p>
        The invasions of the Sea Peoples reshaped the Eastern Mediterranean. 
        The Hittite Empire collapsed, Canaanite city-states were transformed, and Egypt entered a long decline after exhausting wars. 
        The Philistines, one of the Sea Peoples groups, became major players in Iron Age Levantine politics, frequently clashing with emerging Israelite polities.
