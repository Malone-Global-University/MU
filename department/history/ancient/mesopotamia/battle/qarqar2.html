    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Battle of Qarqar (c. 900 BCE, traditionally dated to 853 BCE) was one of the most significant military confrontations of the early first millennium BCE. It pitted the Neo-Assyrian king Shalmaneser III against a broad coalition of Levantine states, including Aram-Damascus, Israel under King Ahab, Hamath, and other allies. The event is preserved in Assyrian royal inscriptions, boasting of Assyrian might, but also reveals the extraordinary resistance mounted by smaller kingdoms against imperial expansion.</p>

    <h2>Historical Sources</h2>
    <p>The main source for the battle is the Kurkh Monolith inscription of Shalmaneser III, discovered in the 19th century. It lists the composition of the coalition, the number of troops, and Shalmaneser’s claimed victory. Biblical texts do not directly describe the battle but situate the reigns of Ahab of Israel and Hadadezer of Damascus within this turbulent era of Assyrian pressure.</p>

    <h2>Coalition Forces</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hadadezer (Ben-Hadad II) of Aram-Damascus — chariots, cavalry, and infantry.</li>
      <li>Ahab of Israel — contributed 2,000 chariots and 10,000 troops (per Assyrian account).</li>
      <li>Irhuleni of Hamath — additional contingents.</li>
      <li>Other Levantine kings including from Ammon, Arvad, and Egypt.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Narrative of the Battle</h2>
    <p>According to Shalmaneser III, the Assyrians faced a coalition army numbering over 60,000 troops. The Kurkh Monolith describes a massive clash at Qarqar, with Assyria deploying infantry, cavalry, and siege engines. While the inscription claims a decisive Assyrian victory, historians doubt the extent of this triumph, as Assyria did not immediately gain lasting control over the Levant. The coalition’s very ability to assemble such numbers testifies to the severity of the Assyrian threat and the resilience of regional states.</p>

    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <p>The battle marked both the high point of Levantine resistance and the beginning of Assyria’s long campaign of dominance in the region. Though the Assyrians continued their raids, the coalition delayed imperial conquest for decades. The event stands as one of the earliest well-documented examples of a grand alliance against a superpower.</p>
