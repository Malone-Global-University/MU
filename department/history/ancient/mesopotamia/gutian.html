  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Gutians were semi-nomadic tribes from the Zagros Mountains to the east of Mesopotamia. Little is known about their language or culture, but they are first mentioned in Mesopotamian records as invaders following the decline of Akkad around 2154 BCE.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
    <p>As the Akkadian Empire weakened due to internal strife and external pressures, the Gutians invaded and gradually took control of key Mesopotamian cities, including Agade (Akkad) and Nippur. Their rule marked a period of political fragmentation and economic decline.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Little is known about individual Gutian rulers; historical sources mention kings such as <strong>Erridupizir</strong> and <strong>Inimabakesh</strong>.</li>
      <li>Their leadership structure is unclear, suggesting a tribal or loosely centralized monarchy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Invasion of Akkadian territories around 2154 BCE.</li>
      <li>Control over major city-states including Agade, Nippur, and possibly Uruk.</li>
      <li>Resistance and uprisings from remaining Sumerian city-states, especially Ur under the Third Dynasty of Ur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Little is known about Gutian religion. They likely adopted local Sumerian and Akkadian religious practices during their rule, but no major temples or inscriptions are attributed directly to Gutian rulers.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>The Gutian Dynasty fell around 2112 BCE when the Sumerian city-state of Ur, under Ur-Nammu of the Ur III dynasty, launched a successful campaign to restore order. The Gutians were expelled from central Mesopotamia, marking the end of their brief rule.</p>

  <!-- Historiography -->
  <section class="content-section" id="historiography">
    <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

    <h3>What We Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Gutians ruled Mesopotamia for roughly four decades following the Akkadian collapse.</li>
      <li>They caused political fragmentation and economic disruption, which were later addressed by the Ur III dynasty.</li>
      <li>Mesopotamian sources describe them as foreigners and often hostile invaders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Assume</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Gutian rule relied on local administration or vassalage due to their limited experience with urban governance.</li>
      <li>They may have maintained a tribal leadership system rather than a fully centralized monarchy.</li>
      <li>Their cultural practices were likely influenced by Sumerian and Akkadian traditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Detailed social, political, and religious structures of the Gutian tribes.</li>
      <li>Extent of their control over distant Mesopotamian regions.</li>
      <li>Language, writing, and other cultural artifacts, as none survive definitively.</li>
    </ul>
