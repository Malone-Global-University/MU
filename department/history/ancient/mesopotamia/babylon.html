  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>By the early 18th century BCE, Mesopotamia was a mosaic of Amorite city-states: Isin, Larsa, Mari, and Babylon among them. Babylon began as a relatively minor kingdom, overshadowed by its rivals. That changed when <strong>Hammurabi</strong> ascended the throne around 1792 BCE, inheriting a city strategically located along key trade routes and the Euphrates River.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>The Rise of Babylon</h2>
    <p>Through diplomacy, shifting alliances, and calculated wars, Hammurabi transformed Babylon into the dominant power of Mesopotamia. He first secured his borders, then systematically defeated rivals like Larsa, Mari, and Eshnunna. By 1750 BCE, Hammurabi controlled nearly all of southern Mesopotamia and parts of the north, forging the first <em>Babylonian Empire</em>.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hammurabi</strong> ‚Äî Sixth king of the Amorite dynasty of Babylon, famed for his legal code and military campaigns.</li>
      <li><strong>Zimri-Lim</strong> ‚Äî King of Mari, both ally and rival, whose palace archives preserve crucial information about Hammurabi‚Äôs reign.</li>
      <li><strong>Rim-Sin of Larsa</strong> ‚Äî Defeated rival who had dominated southern Mesopotamia before Hammurabi‚Äôs rise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Battles & Campaigns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The conquest of <strong>Larsa</strong> (c. 1763 BCE), ending centuries of rivalry between Babylon and southern Sumerian powers.</li>
      <li>The defeat of <strong>Mari</strong> (c. 1759 BCE), which brought control of vital trade routes along the Euphrates.</li>
      <li>Campaigns against <strong>Eshnunna</strong> and Elamite threats, securing Babylon‚Äôs northern frontier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deities and Religion</h3>
    <p>Hammurabi presented his authority as granted by the gods, especially <strong>Marduk</strong>, Babylon‚Äôs city god. Under his reign, Marduk rose from a local deity to supreme head of the Mesopotamian pantheon‚Äîa transformation that mirrored Babylon‚Äôs own political ascent.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Collapse and Aftermath</h2>
    <p>Hammurabi‚Äôs successors lacked his charisma and strategic skill. Internal unrest, economic strain, and external pressure weakened the empire. Around 1595 BCE, Babylon was dramatically sacked by the <strong>Hittite king Mursili I</strong>, who raided the city and withdrew. In the power vacuum that followed, the <strong>Kassites</strong>‚Äîa mountain people from the Zagros‚Äîtook control, ushering in a new era of Babylonian history.</p>

    <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

    <h3>What We Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>Code of Hammurabi</em> is one of the most complete surviving law codes from the ancient world.</li>
      <li>Hammurabi united much of Mesopotamia under Babylonian rule for the first time.</li>
      <li>Marduk‚Äôs elevation as supreme deity dates to this period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Assume</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The law code was as much royal propaganda as practical law‚Äîfew believe it was consistently enforced.</li>
      <li>Hammurabi‚Äôs alliances were opportunistic, turning allies into enemies when it suited him.</li>
      <li>The Hittite raid may have been more symbolic than destructive, since they withdrew quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How did Hammurabi administer such a vast empire with limited communications?</li>
      <li>What role did climate and shifting river patterns play in Babylon‚Äôs prosperity and decline?</li>
      <li>To what extent did common Babylonians experience Hammurabi‚Äôs reforms in daily life?</li>
    </ul>
