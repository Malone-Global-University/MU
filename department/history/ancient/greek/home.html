      <h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p class="wide">
	     The number of Greek city-states (poleis, singular: polis) varied over time and is hard to pin down to a single figure, because:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New poleis were founded during colonization (especially in Italy, Sicily, Asia Minor, and the Black Sea).</li>
     			<li>Some merged or were destroyed in wars.</li>
     			<li>Others were very small and may not always have been counted.</li>
     			</ul>

	<p class="wide"><strong>Historians estimate:</strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Classical Greece (5th–4th century BCE): Around 1,000 to 1,500 poleis existed across the Greek world.</li>
	<li>The historian Mogens Herman Hansen’s Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis (2004) catalogues over 1,000 poleis with evidence of political organization.</li>
	<li>The most famous ones (Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Delphi, Olympia, etc.) are well-known, but the vast majority were small, rural, or obscure.</li></ul>
	</section>


	<section>
	<h2>Origins of the Polieis</h2>

	<p class="wide">The origins of the Greek city-states (poleis) go very far back, but the first "recorded history" are given as:</p> 
	<h3>1. Proto-Poleis in the Archaic Period</h3>

	<p class="wide">After the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces (c. 1200 BCE), Greece entered the so-called Dark Ages (c. 1100–800 BCE).
	Villages and tribal communities slowly reorganized, and by the 8th century BCE they crystallized into poleis — independent, self-governing city-states.h e earliest recorded traces of poleis appear in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey (c. 750 BCE), which describe cities like Mycenae, Troy, Pylos, and Ithaca. While semi-legendary, they reflect the memory of urban communities.</p>

	<h3>2. Earliest Historical Mentions</h3>

	<p class="wide"> The first true historical evidence for Greek city-states comes from the 8th century BCE, when inscriptions, poetry, and foreign sources begin to name them.</p>

	<h3>For example:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Olympia (776 BCE) – the first recorded Olympic Games, an inter-polis event.</li>
	<li>Colonization records (8th–7th centuries BCE) – inscriptions and traditions of founding colonies like Syracuse, Massalia (Marseille), and Byzantium.</li>
	<li>Hesiod (c. 700 BCE) – his Works and Days reflects a world of small farmers in a polis society.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>3. First Political History</h3>

	<p class="wide">The earliest written political histories of Greek poleis come from Herodotus (c. 440 BCE) in his Histories. He describes city-states like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes in detail, especially their roles in the Persian Wars. Later historians like Thucydides (c. 400 BCE) cover the Peloponnesian War (Athens vs. Sparta), giving us the fullest early record of polis politics.</p>

	<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

	<ul>
	 <li>Origins: Communities forming after 1200 BCE.</li>
	 <li>First traces: Homer (c. 750 BCE) mentions cities.</li>
	 <li>First events: 776 BCE Olympic Games and 8th–7th century colonization.</li>
	 <li>First history: Herodotus (5th century BCE) gives the earliest systematic history of the city-states.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Timeline of the Greek City-States</h2>
			<h3>1. Formation Period (c. 1100–800 BCE)</h3>
			
			<ul>
			<li>1100 BCE – Collapse of the Mycenaean palaces → beginning of the “Dark Ages.”</li>
			<li>900–800 BCE – Small villages begin to cluster into early poleis.</li>
			<li>776 BCE – First Olympic Games, a pan-Hellenic event linking city-states.</li>
			<li>750–700 BCE – Homer’s epics (Iliad and Odyssey) reflect early polis culture.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2. Archaic Age – Rise of the Polis (c. 800–500 BCE)</h3>
			
			<ul>
			<li>800–600 BCE – Colonization movement → poleis found colonies across the Mediterranean (Sicily, Italy, Black Sea, North Africa).</li>
			<li>c. 700 BCE – Emergence of city constitutions; aristocratic rule dominates.</li>
			<li>c. 650–500 BCE – Rise of tyrants in many poleis (non-hereditary rulers who seize power).</li>
			<li>Sparta develops its militarized oligarchy.</li>
			<li>Athens begins reforms: Draco (c. 620 BCE), Solon (c. 594 BCE), and Cleisthenes (c. 508 BCE).</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3. Classical Age – Height of the Polis (c. 500–336 BCE)</h3>
			
			<ul>
			<li>499–449 BCE – Persian Wars unite many poleis against Persia (Marathon 490, Thermopylae/Salamis 480, Plataea 479). Athens and Sparta rise as leaders.</li>
			
			<li>478 BCE – Delian League (led by Athens) formed against Persia.</li>
			<li>460–445 BCE – Athens’ Golden Age under Pericles; democracy, drama, philosophy, and art flourish.</li>
			<li>431–404 BCE – Peloponnesian War (Athens vs. Sparta + allies). Sparta wins, but Greece is weakened.</li>
			<li>371 BCE – Battle of Leuctra: Thebes defeats Sparta, ending Spartan dominance.</li>
			<li>362 BCE – Battle of Mantinea: Thebes’ brief hegemony ends. No polis dominates; instability grows.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>4. Decline and Loss of Independence (336–146 BCE)</h3>
			
			<ul>
			<li>338 BCE – Battle of Chaeronea: Philip II of Macedon defeats Athens & Thebes. Poleis lose independence, though they retain some local identity.</li>
			
			<li>336–323 BCE – Alexander the Great expands Macedonian power, spreading Hellenistic culture.</li>
			<li>323–146 BCE – Hellenistic kingdoms (Macedonia, Egypt, Seleucid Asia) overshadow the city-states, which now play only regional roles.</li>
			<li>146 BCE – Roman conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. The polis system effectively ends as an independent political order, though cities continue under Roman administration.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="wide"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

			<ul>
			<li>Rise: 1100–500 BCE (formation and colonization).</li>
			<li>Peak: 500–336 BCE (Classical Age: democracy, wars, art, philosophy).</li>
			<li>Fall: 336–146 BCE (Macedonian domination, then Rome).</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Secular Government & Life in Ancient Greece</h2>


				<h3>1. Dark Age (c. 1100–800 BCE)</h3>
				
				<p class="wide"><strong>Government:</strong></p>
				<p class="wide">Local chiefs/basileis ruled small villages.</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Economy = subsistence farming, herding.</li>
				<li>Trade minimal after Mycenaean collapse.</li>

				</ul>

				<h3>2. Archaic Period (c. 800–500 BCE)</h3>
				
				<p class="wide"><strong>Government:</strong></p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Rise of the polis (city-state) → independent political units with citizens.</li>
				<li>Law codes: Draco (Athens, c. 620 BCE), Solon’s reforms (c. 594 BCE).</li>
				<li>Tyrants briefly ruled many poleis, often expanding trade and building works.</li>
				<li>Sparta created military oligarchy; Athens pioneered democracy (Cleisthenes, 508 BCE).</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="wide"><strong>Life:</strong></p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Colonization movement spread Greek culture to Italy, Sicily, Black Sea, and beyond.</li>
				<li>Aristocracy dominated land ownership, but merchant/trader classes grew.</li>
				<li>Hoplite warfare emerges (citizen-soldier phalanx).</li>

				</ul>

				<h3>3. Classical Period (c. 500–336 BCE)</h3>
				
				<p class="wide"><strong>Government:</strong></p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Athens develops direct democracy (citizens’ assembly, juries, ostracism).</li>
				<li>Sparta = dual kings + council + ephors.</li>
				<li>Alliances: Delian League (Athens) and Peloponnesian League (Sparta).</li>
				<li>Peloponnesian War shows fragility of polis politics.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="wide"><strong>Life:</strong></p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Economy: trade flourishes (wine, olive oil, pottery).</li>
				<li>Social classes: citizens, metics (resident foreigners), slaves.</li>
				<li>Education: Athens (liberal arts, rhetoric), Sparta (military training).</li>
				<li>Theater, philosophy, public debate = civic life centered around the agora (marketplace).</li>
				<li>Architecture & public works (Acropolis, Parthenon) → civic pride and identity.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>4. Hellenistic Period (336–146 BCE)</h3>
				

				<p class="wide"><strong>Government:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Independent poleis lose sovereignty → absorbed into Macedonian then Roman systems.</li>

				<ul>
				<li>Cities (Alexandria, Pergamon, Antioch) become cosmopolitan centers of learning and trade.</li>
