      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The Battle of Megiddo, fought around 1457 BCE, marked the rise of Egypt as the uncontested military power of the Near East under Pharaoh Thutmose III. 
        Following the death of Hatshepsut, subject states in Canaan and Syria attempted to break free of Egyptian dominance. 
        Their leader, the King of Kadesh, united a coalition of Canaanite princes and fortified their position near the strategic city of Megiddo, a gateway to northern trade routes.

      <h2>Armies and Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Thutmose III marched from Egypt at the head of an army of approximately 20,000 troops, a mixture of infantry, archers, and war chariots. 
        His generals advised him to take the safer northern and southern routes into the Jezreel Valley, but Thutmose boldly chose the narrow central route through the Aruna pass. 
        This surprise maneuver allowed the Egyptians to appear suddenly on the plain, catching the coalition off guard.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Canaanite coalition numbered around 15,000–20,000 warriors, composed of city militias, mercenaries, and chariotry. 
        Their forces were spread out, expecting Egypt to come by the wider roads, and were unprepared for the sudden Egyptian advance.

      <h2>The Battle</h2>
      <p>
        On the day of battle, the Egyptian chariots struck first, scattering the unprepared Canaanite lines. 
        Thutmose’s disciplined infantry pressed the attack, while his archers unleashed volleys that disrupted enemy formations. 
        The surprise and speed of the Egyptian attack caused panic: many Canaanite soldiers fled toward Megiddo’s fortified walls, abandoning their camp and war gear.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the Egyptians paused to plunder the enemy camp instead of pursuing them directly into the city. 
        This allowed the survivors to retreat behind Megiddo’s walls, prolonging the conflict into a prolonged siege that lasted several months.

      <h2>Aftermath</h2>
      <p>
        The city of Megiddo eventually surrendered, forcing the Canaanite leaders to give hostages and renew their allegiance to Egypt. 
        Thutmose III’s victory restored Egyptian dominance over Canaan and Syria, securing vital trade routes and ensuring the flow of tribute into Egypt. 
        The campaign was recorded in detail on the walls of the Temple of Amun at Karnak, making it the earliest known battle for which we possess a comprehensive account.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Battle of Megiddo demonstrated the effectiveness of strategic risk-taking, rapid maneuvering, and combined-arms tactics. 
        It secured Thutmose III’s reputation as one of Egypt’s greatest warrior-kings and inaugurated a period of Egyptian empire at its widest territorial extent. 
        The battle also set a precedent in military historiography, as scribes carefully recorded not only the battle itself but also the logistics, speeches, and spoils of war.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name "Megiddo" would echo through history, later transformed into the biblical "Armageddon," symbolizing the ultimate battlefield of the future.
