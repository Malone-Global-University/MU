  <h2>Early Harappan Phase (c. 3300‚Äì2600 BCE)</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Early Harappan phase saw the emergence of small settlements along the Indus River, development of agriculture, and gradual urbanization leading to standardized crafts and trade networks.</p>

    <p class="wide">  The Early Harappan period marks the formative stage of the Indus Valley Civilization, when scattered Neolithic farming villages began to grow into more complex proto-urban communities. Small settlements appeared along the Indus River and its tributaries, as well as in regions such as Baluchistan, Gujarat, and Punjab. Agriculture became more organized, with evidence of wheat, barley, peas, and sesame cultivation, supported by irrigation and seasonal floodwaters. Domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats were integral to subsistence and trade.</p>

    <p class="wide">Pottery styles began to standardize, often decorated with geometric motifs, and local craftsmen experimented with copper tools, beads, and terracotta figurines. Storage facilities, defensive walls, and planned street layouts foreshadowed later urban development. Regional centers like Mehrgarh (a continuation from the Neolithic) and Kot Diji show signs of fortifications and administrative control, suggesting early political organization.</p>

    <p class="wide">This era also witnessed the beginnings of long-distance exchange networks. Communities traded semi-precious stones such as carnelian, lapis lazuli, and turquoise, connecting the Indus region with Central Asia, Mesopotamia, and the Iranian plateau. The gradual growth of these settlements, along with shared material culture, set the foundation for the Mature Harappan phase, when fully developed cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro would rise.</p>

    <!-- Mature Harappan Phase -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Mature Harappan Phase (c. 2600‚Äì1900 BCE)</h2>

<p class="wide">Mature Harappan Phase (c. 2600‚Äì1900 BCE)
The Mature Harappan period represents the height of the Indus Valley Civilization, when it developed into one of the world‚Äôs first great urban societies, contemporary with Old Kingdom Egypt and Sumerian Mesopotamia. By this time, large, carefully planned cities such as Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, Dholavira, Kalibangan, and Lothal had emerged, each built with standardized brick sizes, grid-patterned streets, and sophisticated drainage systems that highlight a remarkable level of civic engineering.</p>

<p class="wide">Agriculture flourished on a scale sufficient to support large populations, with wheat, barley, sesame, cotton, and rice cultivated in different regions. Irrigation canals, reservoirs, and water management systems‚Äîespecially in semi-arid areas like Gujarat‚Äîallowed stable farming and surplus production. Surpluses sustained specialized craftspeople who produced beads, seals, ceramics, textiles, and metal goods, many of which were traded across vast distances.</p>

<p class="wide">A hallmark of this phase was cultural uniformity: weights and measures were standardized, pottery styles and motifs were shared across settlements, and seals bearing animal motifs and an undeciphered script were used for administrative and possibly ritual purposes. This suggests some form of coordinated governance or shared ideology, though there is no evidence of kings or palaces as in Mesopotamia. Instead, authority may have rested in councils or collective civic management.</p>

<p class="wide">Harappan society also developed extensive trade networks. Maritime trade through ports like Lothal connected the Indus Valley with Oman, Bahrain (Dilmun), Mesopotamia, and beyond, while overland caravans reached Afghanistan and Central Asia. Harappan goods‚Äîparticularly beads, lapis lazuli, cotton textiles, and carnelian ornaments‚Äîhave been found in Mesopotamian sites, while Mesopotamian texts refer to a distant trading partner called Meluhha, widely identified with the Indus region.</p>

<p class="wide">Religious and cultural life flourished as well. Small terracotta figurines, ritual baths, and fire altars suggest a variety of belief systems tied to fertility, water, and possibly proto-Hindu traditions. The so-called ‚ÄúGreat Bath‚Äù of Mohenjo-Daro indicates the centrality of ritual cleanliness. Animal motifs like bulls, elephants, and unicorn-like figures were recurring themes, pointing to symbolic and possibly religious importance.</p>

<p class="wide">At its peak, the Mature Harappan phase saw a highly interconnected network of urban and rural settlements spanning from present-day Afghanistan to western India, united by shared material culture, technology, and trade. It stands as one of the earliest examples of a large, decentralized but cohesive civilization.</p>

<p class="wide">The Mature Harappan phase represents the height of the Indus Valley Civilization, when urban planning, craft specialization, 
and long-distance trade networks reached their peak. Cities were built with remarkable uniformity, featuring baked brick architecture, 
advanced drainage systems, and standardized weights and measures.</p>

      <h3>Harappa (Punjab, Pakistan)</h3>
      <p class="wide">

    <!-- Late Harappan Phase -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Late Harappan Phase (c. 1900‚Äì1300 BCE)</h2>
      
<p class="wide">The Late Harappan period marks the gradual decline and transformation of the Indus Valley Civilization. After centuries of urban prosperity, the great cities of Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, and Dholavira began to shrink in size and importance. Archaeological evidence points to several contributing factors, including shifts in the course of rivers like the Saraswati (Ghaggar-Hakra) and Indus, repeated flooding in urban centers, soil salinization from intensive agriculture, and perhaps a changing climate that reduced monsoon rains.</p>

<p class="wide">Urban life became increasingly fragmented. Large cities were abandoned or reduced to smaller settlements, while regional cultures took on more distinct local characteristics. For example, in Punjab and Haryana, the Cemetery H culture emerged, marked by new burial practices and painted pottery styles, while in Gujarat, sites such as Rangpur and Lothal continued to be occupied, though at a reduced scale. Craft specialization declined, and the once-standardized weights, measures, and script fell out of widespread use.</p>

<p class="wide">Despite this decline in central coordination, Harappan traditions persisted in modified forms. Pottery styles, bead-making, and certain motifs continued, though with more regional variation. Agricultural communities carried forward techniques of farming wheat, barley, and rice, and pastoralism gained greater prominence as people became more mobile.</p>

<p class="wide">Trade networks also weakened but did not disappear. While long-distance exchange with Mesopotamia diminished after 1900 BCE, local and regional trade survived. Harappan goods were still exchanged within South Asia, and some sites maintained connections with Central Asia and the Iranian plateau.</p>

<p class="wide">The Late Harappan phase overlaps with the arrival of Indo-Aryan speaking groups into South Asia. While the nature of this interaction remains debated, many scholars suggest that the decline of urban Harappan centers created openings for new cultural influences to take root. By around 1300 BCE, the last vestiges of Harappan urban culture had faded, giving way to a more rural, village-based society that would lay the groundwork for later Vedic traditions.</p>

<p class="wide">Rather than a sudden collapse, the Late Harappan period represents a gradual decentralization‚Äîthe dispersal of a once-unified civilization into diverse regional cultures. In this way, the legacy of the Indus Valley lived on, not in monumental cities, but in the practices and traditions absorbed into subsequent South Asian history.</p>

<p class="wide">After 1900 BCE, the urban system gradually declined. Major cities were abandoned or reduced in size, 
trade with Mesopotamia dwindled, and the uniformity of material culture fragmented. 
Regional cultures emerged, each adapting Harappan traditions in new ways.</p>


      <h3>Rangpur & Surkotada (Gujarat, India)</h3>
      <p class="wide"> Smaller settlements that carried on Harappan pottery traditions.<br>
                       Evidence of increasing pastoralism and local adaptation.</p>



      <h3>Harappa (Punjab, Pakistan)</h3>
      <p class="wide">
        Decline in urban planning; houses built over earlier streets. <br>
        The city shrank, with less emphasis on monumental structures. <br>
        Burial practices changed, pottery became less standardized, and seals were rarely used. <br>
        Local pottery traditions replacing standardized Harappan styles.<br>
        New ceramic traditions like the Painted Grey Ware began to appear alongside older Harappan styles.</p>
        

      <h3>Mohenjo-Daro (Sindh, Pakistan)</h3>
      <p class="wide">
        Much of Mohenjo-Daro was abandoned. Flood layers suggest environmental stress from river shifts. <br>
        Remaining inhabitants reused older structures in a less organized way. <br>
        Long-distance trade items such as lapis lazuli and Mesopotamian seals vanish from the archaeological record.<br>
        Reduced population; signs of flooding and gradual abandonment.<br>
        Decline in craft production and trade activity.</p>

      <h3>Dholavira (Gujarat, India)</h3>
      <p class="wide">
        Dholavira continued longer than most Harappan cities but gradually declined as water sources failed. <br>
        Reservoirs silted up and urban planning eroded. The once-imposing citadel became sparsely inhabited. <br>
        Shrinkage of city limits; partial abandonment.<br>
        Continued, but simplified, use of water management systems.</p>

      <h3>Lothal (Gujarat, India)</h3>
      <p class="wide">
        The dockyard fell out of use as sea levels shifted and silt clogged access channels. <br>
        Craft industries diminished, but some bead workshops lingered, suggesting localized activity even after wider collapse.<br>
        Port silted up, reducing maritime trade.<br>
        Decline in craft specialization, though small-scale bead-making persisted.</p>

      <h3>Punjab and Haryana Villages (Cemetery H Culture)</h3>
      <p class="wide">
        Smaller rural sites multiplied as people moved out of cities. <br>
        These communities carried forward Harappan pottery styles and weights but lived in less formalized settlements. <br>
        Farming and pastoralism became the primary economic base.<br>
        Distinct Late Harappan regional culture.<br>
        New burial practices and painted pottery.<br>
        Possible cultural overlap with early Indo-Aryan groups.</p>
