  <h2>Indus Valley Civilization</h2>
  <p>The Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1300 BCE) was a highly organized urban society along the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan and northwest India. Known for city planning, trade networks, metallurgy, and undeciphered script, it represents one of the earliest complex civilizations in South Asia.</p>

  <h2>Early Harappan Phase (c. 3300–2600 BCE)</h2>
  <p>The Early Harappan phase saw the emergence of small settlements along the Indus River, development of agriculture, and gradual urbanization leading to standardized crafts and trade networks.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section" id="origins1">
  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>The Indus Valley Civilization grew from local farming communities along the Indus River. Early settlements laid the foundation for larger urban centers by integrating agriculture, craft specialization, and rudimentary trade networks.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section" id="rise1">
  <h2>Rise and Achievements</h2>
  <p>During the Mature Harappan period (c. 2600–1900 BCE), cities like Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, and Dholavira displayed advanced urban planning, including grid layouts, drainage systems, granaries, and standardized bricks.</p>

  <h3>Key Sites and Figures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Harappa</strong> — Major urban center; organized streets, citadel, and trade hub.</li>
    <li><strong>Mohenjo-Daro</strong> — Exemplary urban planning, Great Bath, and advanced drainage.</li>
    <li><strong>Dholavira</strong> — Northern Gujarat city with sophisticated water management and fortifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Trade and Economy</h3>
  <p>The Indus Valley engaged in trade with Mesopotamia and surrounding regions. They used standardized weights and measures, and crafted seals for commerce and administration.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section" id="fall1">
  <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
  <p>By c. 1900 BCE, the Indus Valley cities declined, possibly due to climate change, river course shifts, and disruptions in trade networks. The Late Harappan phase saw regionalization and the disappearance of major urban centers.</p>

  <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

  <h3>What We Know</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Major cities exhibited remarkable urban planning and sanitation systems.</li>
    <li>Trade networks extended to Mesopotamia, Iran, and Afghanistan.</li>
    <li>Craft specialization included pottery, metallurgy, and bead-making.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What We Assume</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Indus script was used for administrative and possibly ritual purposes, though undeciphered.</li>
    <li>Society was likely hierarchical but may have been less centralized than Mesopotamian or Egyptian states.</li>
    <li>Environmental changes contributed to the decline of urban centers.</li>

    <!-- Mature Harappan Phase -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Mature Harappan Phase (c. 2600–1900 BCE)</h2>
      <p>
        The Mature Harappan phase represents the height of the Indus Valley Civilization, when urban planning, craft specialization, 
        and long-distance trade networks reached their peak. Cities were built with remarkable uniformity, featuring baked brick architecture, 
        advanced drainage systems, and standardized weights and measures.
      </p>

      <h3>Harappa</h3>
      <p>
        Harappa was one of the earliest major sites discovered. The city reveals a grid layout with fortified citadel and lower town. 
        Evidence of large granaries, workshops, and administrative seals suggest it served as a regional capital. 
        Pottery workshops and bead-making industries highlight craft specialization.
      </p>

      <h3>Mohenjo-Daro</h3>
      <p>
        Mohenjo-Daro, located along the Indus, is the best-preserved Harappan city. Its Great Bath indicates communal or ritual use of water. 
        The city had wide streets, advanced drainage, and multi-storied houses. It was likely a cultural and economic hub, 
        with craft industries, public granaries, and a strong administrative structure inferred from standardized architecture.
      </p>

      <h3>Dholavira</h3>
      <p>
        Located in Gujarat, Dholavira had a unique water management system, with massive reservoirs and channels carved into the rock. 
        Its citadel was divided into distinct sections, possibly indicating social stratification. A remarkable inscription on a large signboard 
        suggests public display of Harappan script.
      </p>

      <h3>Lothal</h3>
      <p>
        Famous for its dockyard, Lothal connected the Indus world to maritime trade across the Arabian Sea. 
        Excavations revealed bead-making workshops, semi-precious stone industries, and evidence of far-reaching trade contacts 
        with Mesopotamia and Oman.
      </p>

      <h3>Kalibangan</h3>
      <p>
        Situated in Rajasthan, Kalibangan shows evidence of ploughed fields — the earliest known in South Asia. 
        Its citadel and lower town were fortified separately, and it also produced distinctive painted pottery. 
        Ritual fire altars suggest religious practices distinct from those at other Harappan sites.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Late Harappan Phase -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Late Harappan Phase (c. 1900–1300 BCE)</h2>
      <p>
        After 1900 BCE, the urban system gradually declined. Major cities were abandoned or reduced in size, 
        trade with Mesopotamia dwindled, and the uniformity of material culture fragmented. 
        Regional cultures emerged, each adapting Harappan traditions in new ways.
      </p>

      <h3>Harappa (Late)</h3>
      <p>
        The city shrank, with less emphasis on monumental structures. Burial practices changed, 
        pottery became less standardized, and seals were rarely used. 
        New ceramic traditions like the Painted Grey Ware began to appear alongside older Harappan styles.
      </p>

      <h3>Mohenjo-Daro (Late)</h3>
      <p>
        Much of Mohenjo-Daro was abandoned. Flood layers suggest environmental stress from river shifts. 
        Remaining inhabitants reused older structures in a less organized way. 
        Long-distance trade items such as lapis lazuli and Mesopotamian seals vanish from the archaeological record.
      </p>

      <h3>Dholavira (Late)</h3>
      <p>
        Dholavira continued longer than most Harappan cities but gradually declined as water sources failed. 
        Reservoirs silted up and urban planning eroded. The once-imposing citadel became sparsely inhabited.
      </p>

      <h3>Lothal (Late)</h3>
      <p>
        The dockyard fell out of use as sea levels shifted and silt clogged access channels. 
        Craft industries diminished, but some bead workshops lingered, suggesting localized activity even after wider collapse.
      </p>

      <h3>Punjab and Haryana Villages</h3>
      <p>
        Smaller rural sites multiplied as people moved out of cities. 
        These communities carried forward Harappan pottery styles and weights but lived in less formalized settlements. 
        Farming and pastoralism became the primary economic base.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Mature Harappan phase remains a model of early urban planning and long-distance trade. 
        The Late Harappan phase shows cultural resilience despite political and economic decline, 
        carrying Harappan traditions into later Vedic and regional cultures of South Asia.
