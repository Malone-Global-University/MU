    <h2>The Lifeblood of Empire</h2>
    <p>Trade was the circulatory system of the Roman Empire ‚Äî moving grain, oil, wine, and luxury goods from distant provinces to feed and supply millions. From Britain‚Äôs tin mines to Egypt‚Äôs grain fields and India‚Äôs spice ports, commerce bound together the ancient world under Roman control.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Infrastructure and Transportation</h2>
    <p>Roman engineers built one of history‚Äôs greatest logistical systems. Roads, bridges, ports, and shipping lanes enabled efficient movement of armies and goods. The Mediterranean, known as <em>Mare Nostrum</em> (‚ÄúOur Sea‚Äù), was the empire‚Äôs main commercial highway.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Roads:</strong> Over 250,000 miles of paved roads connected provinces, facilitating trade and tax collection.</li>
      <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Key harbors at Ostia, Alexandria, Carthage, and Puteoli handled grain and imports.</li>
      <li><strong>Ships:</strong> Merchant vessels (navis oneraria) carried heavy cargoes; navigation followed seasonal winds.</li>
      <li><strong>Warehouses:</strong> Horrea in Rome stored goods like grain and olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Trade Goods and Markets</h2>
    <p>The Roman economy depended on the steady exchange of essential and luxury goods. Markets operated locally and internationally, regulated by guilds, contracts, and imperial supervision.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Imports:</strong> Silk from China, spices from India, incense from Arabia, ivory from Africa.</li>
      <li><strong>Exports:</strong> Wine, olive oil, pottery, glassware, metal tools, and weapons.</li>
      <li><strong>Everyday Goods:</strong> Grain, salt, fish sauce (garum), textiles, and ceramics filled urban markets.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketplaces:</strong> The Forum in Rome served as a political and commercial hub.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Regional Trade Networks</h2>
    <p>Each region of the empire specialized in certain products and became vital to imperial stability. Regional economies were connected through long-distance sea and land routes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Egypt:</strong> Grain production for the Roman populace.</li>
      <li><strong>North Africa:</strong> Olive oil and grain exports.</li>
      <li><strong>Spain & Gaul:</strong> Metals (gold, silver, iron) and wine.</li>
      <li><strong>Britain:</strong> Tin, lead, and wool.</li>
      <li><strong>Greece & Asia Minor:</strong> Marble, art, and luxury goods.</li>
      <li><strong>Eastern Provinces:</strong> Spices, silk, and exotic imports via the Red Sea and Silk Road.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Maritime Trade and the Mediterranean</h2>
    <p>The Mediterranean was Rome‚Äôs economic heart. Sea routes allowed mass shipment of grain, oil, and raw materials. Despite risks of storms and piracy, maritime trade remained faster and cheaper than land transport.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grain Fleets:</strong> Annual convoys brought food from Egypt to Rome.</li>
      <li><strong>Merchant Guilds:</strong> Organized associations managed shipping and contracts.</li>
      <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Ostia (Italy), Carthage (Africa), and Alexandria (Egypt) were key trade nodes.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Silk Road and Beyond</h2>
    <p>Roman merchants reached far beyond imperial borders. Through intermediaries, they traded with Indian, Persian, and Chinese markets. Silk, spices, gems, and perfumes flowed west; gold, silver, and glassware traveled east.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Land Routes:</strong> Through Parthia and Central Asia to China.</li>
      <li><strong>Sea Routes:</strong> From Red Sea ports to India‚Äôs Malabar Coast.</li>
      <li><strong>Diplomatic Links:</strong> Roman embassies recorded as far east as the Han dynasty.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Currency and Exchange</h2>
    <p>Standardized coinage made Rome‚Äôs economy truly interconnected. The denarius and aureus were accepted across the empire, simplifying taxation and trade. Exchange rates and contracts were enforced by imperial law and local magistrates.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Commerce and the Roman State</h2>
    <p>While private enterprise thrived, the state also played a major role. Rome taxed provincial trade, controlled certain monopolies (like salt), and ensured grain supply to urban populations. Trade profits supported public works, armies, and imperial luxury.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Decline of Commerce</h2>
    <p>As the empire faced political instability and invasions, trade networks collapsed. Piracy increased, roads fell into disrepair, and inflation weakened the currency. Local economies replaced the once-global Roman market, foreshadowing the medieval world.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legacy of Roman Trade</h2>
    <p>Rome‚Äôs commercial systems influenced centuries of European and Mediterranean trade. Its ports, markets, and maritime routes remained active into the Byzantine and Islamic periods ‚Äî the ancient foundations of global commerce.</p>
