      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The story of Rome stretches across more than a millennium. From its legendary founding in 753 BCE as a small settlement on the Tiber River, Rome transitioned from monarchy to republic, and eventually to grew into one of the greatest empire civilizations of the ancient world. At its height, the Roman Empire stretched from Britain to Mesopotamia, governing diverse peoples through a combination of military power, infrastructure, and law. Its influence spanned law, government, engineering, literature, and military organization, leaving a legacy that shaped Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East for centuries. This page serves as the gateway to Romeâ€™s history, culture, and achievements. Even after the fall of the Western Empire in 476 CE, the Eastern (Byzantine) Empire preserved Roman traditions until 1453 CE.</p>
      <p>This hub will connect you to dedicated pages on each period and theme in Roman history, allowing for deeper study into 
         specific aspects of Roman life and governance.</p>

      <h2>Roman Society and Culture</h2>
      <p>Roman society was hierarchical and diverse, from patricians and senators to plebeians, freedmen, and slaves. Family, 
         honor, and citizenship were central concepts. Romans built bustling cities filled with forums, markets, theaters, baths, 
         and amphitheaters. Latin literature, realistic art, and innovative architecture left lasting cultural contributions.</p>

      <h2>Government and Law</h2>
      <p>Rome pioneered complex systems of governance, from the checks-and-balances of the Republic to the centralized authority 
         of the Empire. Roman law, first codified in the Twelve Tables, evolved into a sophisticated body of legal principles that 
         remain the foundation of modern Western legal systems.</p>

      <h2>Military and Expansion</h2>
      <p>The Roman army was the backbone of expansion and control. Organized into legions, with advanced training and discipline, 
         Romeâ€™s forces conquered vast territories and secured the empire with roads, forts, and colonies. Warfare shaped Roman politics, 
         economy, and society.</p>

      <h2>Economy and Trade</h2>
      <p>Romeâ€™s economy relied on agriculture, slave labor, taxation, and extensive trade networks. Grain from Egypt, olive oil and wine from 
         Spain and Italy, and luxury goods from the Silk Road sustained Roman markets. Currency, contracts, and trade routes tied the empire together.</p>

      <p>The Western Roman Empire collapsed under pressures of political instability, economic strain, and invasions in the 5th century CE.

         to later civilizations.</p>
