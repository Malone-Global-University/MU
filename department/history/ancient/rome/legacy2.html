      <h1>Legacy of Rome</h1>
      <p>The ideas, institutions, and inventions of Ancient Rome still shape modern life — from government and law to language and architecture.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Although the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE, its influence never disappeared. The Roman world lived on through its laws, culture, language, and the Christian Church. Much of Western civilization rests upon Roman foundations.</p>

      <h2>2. Law and Government</h2>
      <p>Roman law became one of the empire’s most enduring legacies. Concepts like “innocent until proven guilty,” “equality before the law,” and codified statutes influenced modern legal systems worldwide. The <em>Corpus Juris Civilis</em> compiled under Emperor Justinian later inspired European civil law and modern constitutions.</p>

      <p>Republican ideas of checks and balances, senates, and citizen assemblies informed the development of representative governments in Europe and the Americas centuries later.</p>

      <h2>3. Language and Literature</h2>
      <p>Latin, the language of Rome, evolved into the Romance languages — Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian. Latin remained the language of the Church, education, and science for over a millennium.</p>
      <p>Writers such as Virgil, Cicero, Livy, Ovid, and Seneca influenced Western thought, rhetoric, and literature. Many of their works continue to be studied as models of style and philosophy.</p>

      <h2>4. Architecture and Engineering</h2>
      <p>Roman architecture revolutionized construction through the use of arches, vaults, and concrete. Structures like the Colosseum, Pantheon, and aqueducts demonstrated engineering brilliance. These innovations shaped everything from Renaissance cathedrals to modern government buildings.</p>
      <p>Roman city planning — with forums, roads, baths, and amphitheaters — became a model for urban design throughout Europe and beyond.</p>

      <h2>5. Religion and the Christian Church</h2>
      <p>Christianity, once persecuted by the Romans, became the empire’s official religion under Constantine. The Roman Church preserved literacy, art, and philosophy during the Middle Ages. The organization of the Church mirrored Rome’s administrative structure, ensuring the continuity of Roman ideas after the empire’s fall.</p>

      <h2>6. Science, Philosophy, and Education</h2>
      <p>Roman thinkers advanced medicine, astronomy, and geography, often building upon Greek foundations. Figures like Galen, Pliny the Elder, and Ptolemy influenced later scientific thought. Education focused on rhetoric, logic, and law — forming the basis of medieval and Renaissance curricula.</p>

      <h2>7. Art and Cultural Influence</h2>
      <p>Roman sculpture, mosaics, and frescoes inspired later artistic movements. The Renaissance in particular drew directly from Roman ideals of balance, realism, and harmony. Even Roman mythology continued to shape literature, from Dante to modern works.</p>

      <h2>8. Roads, Law, and Legacy in Daily Life</h2>
      <p>Roman roads connected Europe and remain visible today. Their principle — “All roads lead to Rome” — reflected the unity of empire. Many European legal terms, city layouts, and even calendars trace their origins to Roman precedents.</p>

      <h2>9. The Byzantine Connection</h2>
      <p>The Eastern Roman Empire, known as Byzantium, carried Roman culture into the Middle Ages. Its preservation of Greek and Roman knowledge laid the foundation for the later European Renaissance. In a real sense, the Roman legacy never ended — it evolved.</p>

      <blockquote>“Rome has fallen, but her spirit lives on in every stone, every law, every word.”</blockquote>
