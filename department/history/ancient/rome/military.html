  <section>
    <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
    <p>Romeâ€™s military system evolved from a citizen militia during the Republic to a professional, standing army under the Empire. Its flexibility, discipline, and engineering skill made it a model for later militaries.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Organization of the Roman Army</h2>
    <p>The Roman army was divided into highly organized units led by experienced officers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legions:</strong> The core of Romeâ€™s army, each consisting of roughly 5,000 infantry and supporting cavalry.</li>
      <li><strong>Centuries:</strong> Subdivisions of 80 men led by centurions, emphasizing leadership and discipline.</li>
      <li><strong>Auxiliaries:</strong> Non-citizen troops providing cavalry, archers, and specialized forces, often granted citizenship after service.</li>
      <li><strong>Praetorian Guard:</strong> Elite soldiers serving as imperial bodyguards and power brokers in Roman politics.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Tactics and Strategy</h2>
    <p>Roman tactics emphasized coordination, flexibility, and engineering advantage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Formation:</strong> The manipular and later cohort systems allowed adaptation to different terrains and enemies.</li>
      <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Strict training, hierarchy, and punishment ensured order in battle.</li>
      <li><strong>Siege Warfare:</strong> Rome mastered the use of catapults, battering rams, and siege towers to conquer fortified cities.</li>
      <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Roads, supply lines, and standardized equipment kept legions efficient and mobile.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2>
    <p>Standardized arms and armor gave Roman soldiers reliability and efficiency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gladius:</strong> Short sword ideal for close combat.</li>
      <li><strong>Pilum:</strong> Heavy javelin designed to pierce shields and disrupt enemy formations.</li>
      <li><strong>Scutum:</strong> Large rectangular shield offering superior protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Armor:</strong> Chain mail (lorica hamata) and later segmental armor (lorica segmentata) for flexibility and defense.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Engineering and Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>Roman soldiers were also builders, constructing roads, forts, bridges, and siege works that extended imperial control and communication:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Permanent forts and frontier walls, such as Hadrianâ€™s Wall in Britain.</li>
      <li>Roads connecting provincial garrisons and enabling rapid troop movement.</li>
      <li>Temporary camps (castra) built to precise design, even during campaigns.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Military Expansion and Empire</h2>
    <p>The army not only defended Rome but expanded it across Europe, Africa, and Asia Minor. Conquests brought wealth, slaves, and new cultures into the empire â€” but over time, overextension and reliance on mercenaries weakened military stability.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legacy of the Roman Army</h2>
    <p>The Roman militaryâ€™s discipline, organization, and engineering influenced countless later armies. Its legacy persists in military strategy, fort design, and even modern infrastructure. The army was not only a tool of conquest â€” it was a force of civilization and order throughout the empire.</p>
