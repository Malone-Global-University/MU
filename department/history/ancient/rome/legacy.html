    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Byzantine Empire, known to its citizens simply as the ‚ÄúRoman Empire,‚Äù was the direct continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire after the fall of the West in 476 CE. Centered in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), it endured until 1453 CE, bridging antiquity and the medieval world. The Byzantines preserved Greek and Roman learning, maintained Roman law, and shaped the Christian world for centuries.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Founding of Constantinople</h2>
    <p>In 330 CE, Emperor Constantine the Great established <strong>Constantinople</strong> as the new capital of the empire. Strategically positioned between Europe and Asia, it became a hub of commerce, culture, and defense. The city‚Äôs massive walls and wealth ensured its survival for more than a millennium.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Political Structure and Administration</h2>
    <p>The Byzantine government combined Roman imperial traditions with Christian authority. The emperor was seen as God‚Äôs representative on Earth, ruling with absolute power but bound by divine law. A complex bureaucracy managed taxation, military organization, and foreign policy with remarkable efficiency.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Religion and the Christian Empire</h2>
    <p>Christianity was the unifying force of the Byzantine world. The Church became both a spiritual and political power. The emperor and the patriarch of Constantinople worked in tandem, shaping doctrine and influencing global Christianity. The division between the Latin West and Greek East eventually led to the <strong>Great Schism of 1054</strong>, separating the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Society and Culture</h2>
    <p>Byzantine society blended Roman law, Greek philosophy, and Christian faith. Education was widespread among the elite, with classical texts preserved in monasteries and libraries. The empire‚Äôs artists and architects created dazzling mosaics, icons, and the magnificent <strong>Hagia Sophia</strong> ‚Äî a lasting symbol of Byzantine devotion and innovation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Military and Defense</h2>
    <p>Byzantium‚Äôs survival depended on its strong military and strategic diplomacy. The <strong>Greek fire</strong> ‚Äî an incendiary weapon ‚Äî defended the capital during sieges. The empire‚Äôs navy controlled trade routes, while its armies balanced alliances and rivalries with Persians, Arabs, and Turks.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Economy and Trade</h2>
    <p>Constantinople‚Äôs wealth came from its position at the crossroads of East and West. Trade in silk, spices, and precious metals flowed through its markets. The Byzantine gold coin, the <strong>solidus</strong>, became the standard currency of the Mediterranean for centuries.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Periods of Strength and Decline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Justinian I (527‚Äì565 CE):</strong> Reconquered parts of the West, codified Roman law (Corpus Juris Civilis), built the Hagia Sophia.</li>
      <li><strong>Iconoclast Controversy (8th‚Äì9th centuries):</strong> Religious struggle over the use of icons weakened the empire internally.</li>
      <li><strong>Komnenian Revival (11th‚Äì12th centuries):</strong> Period of military recovery and cultural renaissance.</li>
      <li><strong>Fourth Crusade (1204 CE):</strong> Western crusaders sacked Constantinople, crippling Byzantine power.</li>
      <li><strong>1453 CE:</strong> Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks under Mehmed II ‚Äî the end of the Roman world.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legacy of the Byzantine Empire</h2>
    <p>The Byzantine Empire preserved classical learning and transmitted it to the Islamic world and Renaissance Europe. Its art and theology continue to influence Orthodox Christianity, and its legal and administrative models shaped later European governance.</p>
    <p>Through Byzantium, the Roman Empire did not die ‚Äî it transformed.</p>
