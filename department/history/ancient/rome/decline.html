    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The fall of the Roman Empire was not a single event, but a gradual breakdown of political unity, economic strength, and social order. By the 5th century CE, Romeâ€™s once-mighty institutions had crumbled under internal corruption and external attack. What followed was the transition from the ancient world to the medieval era.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Timeline of Decline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>180 CE â€“ Death of Marcus Aurelius:</strong> End of the Pax Romana; emperors now ruled through crisis.</li>
      <li><strong>235â€“284 CE â€“ Crisis of the Third Century:</strong> Civil wars, invasions, and economic chaos split the empire.</li>
      <li><strong>284â€“305 CE â€“ Reforms of Diocletian:</strong> Attempted stabilization through division and control.</li>
      <li><strong>312â€“337 CE â€“ Constantineâ€™s Rule:</strong> Christianity legalized; capital moved to Constantinople.</li>
      <li><strong>395 CE â€“ Final Division:</strong> Empire permanently split into Eastern and Western halves.</li>
      <li><strong>410 CE â€“ Sack of Rome:</strong> Visigoths under Alaric breach the Eternal City.</li>
      <li><strong>476 CE â€“ Fall of the Western Empire:</strong> Deposition of Romulus Augustulus marks symbolic end of Rome.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Political Corruption and Instability</h2>
    <p>Romeâ€™s leadership decayed under constant coups, assassinations, and short-lived emperors. From 235â€“284 CE, over 20 emperors ruled in just 50 years. Local governors acted independently, and armies declared their own generals as emperors â€” destroying central authority.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Economic Decline</h2>
    <p>Heavy taxation, inflation, and declining trade undermined prosperity. As military costs soared, currency was debased, causing prices to skyrocket. Slave labor and agricultural decline reduced productivity, while rural estates grew self-sufficient â€” isolating local economies from the imperial market.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trade routes became unsafe due to invasions and piracy.</li>
      <li>Currency lost value as emperors minted cheap coins.</li>
      <li>Population decline reduced labor and tax revenues.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Military Problems</h2>
    <p>The Roman army, once the backbone of the empire, grew expensive and unreliable. Recruitment declined, forcing emperors to hire foreign mercenaries â€” some of whom turned against their employers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Frontiers stretched too far to defend effectively.</li>
      <li>Barbarian invasions increased pressure on the Rhine and Danube borders.</li>
      <li>Internal wars drained manpower and resources.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Social and Cultural Changes</h2>
    <p>The decline of civic life and the growth of Christianity transformed Roman identity. Citizens lost faith in imperial institutions, while the new Christian Church offered stability and moral authority. Wealth concentrated in fewer hands, and rural life replaced urban vibrancy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Division of the Empire</h2>
    <p>Emperor Diocletianâ€™s reforms divided the empire into Eastern and Western halves to improve governance. While the East (Byzantine Empire) grew wealthier and more stable, the West faced continuous invasions and economic collapse. Constantinople became the new power center.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Barbarian Invasions</h2>
    <p>Germanic, Hunnic, and other tribal migrations reshaped the empireâ€™s borders. Initially serving as allies or settlers, these groups eventually turned against Rome. The Visigoths, Vandals, and Ostrogoths each contributed to the Western Empireâ€™s downfall.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>376 CE:</strong> Gothic refugees cross the Danube, later rebel against Rome.</li>
      <li><strong>410 CE:</strong> Visigoths sack Rome â€” the first in 800 years.</li>
      <li><strong>455 CE:</strong> Vandals sack Rome again from North Africa.</li>
      <li><strong>476 CE:</strong> Germanic general Odoacer deposes the last Western emperor.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Religious Transformation</h2>
    <p>Constantineâ€™s conversion and Theodosiusâ€™s establishment of Christianity as the state religion shifted Romeâ€™s spiritual focus. Pagan temples closed, and the Church gained political power â€” preserving Roman culture even as the empire collapsed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Environmental and Demographic Factors</h2>
    <p>Plagues, deforestation, and soil exhaustion reduced population and productivity. Epidemics like the Plague of Cyprian (3rd century) killed millions, weakening both economy and defense.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legacy and Continuity</h2>
    <p>Though the Western Empire fell in 476 CE, Romeâ€™s legacy endured. The Eastern Empire (Byzantium) lasted another thousand years. Roman law, language, architecture, and religion shaped medieval Europe and the foundations of modern Western civilization.</p>
