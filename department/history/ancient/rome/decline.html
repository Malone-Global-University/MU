      <h1>The Decline and Fall of Rome</h1>
      <p>From power and prosperity to division and downfall ‚Äî the story of how the greatest empire in the ancient world collapsed.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>The fall of Rome was not a single event but a long process of political, economic, and military decay that culminated in 476 CE with the deposition of the last Western emperor, Romulus Augustulus. While the Eastern Empire (Byzantium) continued for another thousand years, the West fragmented into the kingdoms of medieval Europe.</p>

      <h2>2. Political Corruption and Instability</h2>
      <p>Frequent changes of leadership, civil wars, and corruption weakened the central government. Emperors were often chosen by the army, not by merit or law, leading to instability. The Senate lost its influence, and loyalty to Rome gave way to loyalty to generals and local elites.</p>

      <h2>3. Economic Problems</h2>
      <p>Heavy taxation, reliance on slave labor, inflation, and declining trade all contributed to a shrinking economy. As wealth concentrated in the hands of elites, rural poverty spread. The empire could no longer sustain its vast military and infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>4. Military Decline</h2>
      <p>Once the pride of Rome, the legions became overextended and underfunded. Mercenaries, often from Germanic tribes, replaced disciplined Roman soldiers, eroding unity and effectiveness. Border defenses along the Rhine and Danube weakened as resources were diverted elsewhere.</p>

      <h2>5. Barbarian Invasions</h2>
      <p>Germanic tribes such as the Visigoths, Vandals, Ostrogoths, and Franks pushed into Roman territory as the Huns migrated westward. In 410 CE, the Visigoths sacked Rome itself, shocking the ancient world. By 455 CE, the Vandals struck again. The empire‚Äôs defenses crumbled under constant pressure.</p>

      <h2>6. Division of the Empire</h2>
      <p>Emperor Diocletian‚Äôs division of the empire into East and West (285 CE) initially stabilized administration but ultimately weakened unity. The richer Eastern Empire (Byzantium) thrived while the Western Empire struggled with invasions and economic decline.</p>

      <h2>7. Cultural and Moral Decay</h2>
      <p>Some historians, such as Edward Gibbon, argued that Rome‚Äôs fall was also moral and cultural ‚Äî a loss of civic virtue, rising luxury, and declining sense of duty. While this view is debated, it reflects ancient fears that Rome‚Äôs spirit had withered before its walls fell.</p>

      <h2>8. The Fall of the Western Empire</h2>
      <p>By the fifth century, Western Rome was a shadow of its former self. The Visigoths under Alaric sacked Rome (410 CE); Attila the Hun threatened Italy (452 CE); and finally, Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus in 476 CE. This date marks the conventional ‚Äúfall‚Äù of the Western Roman Empire.</p>

      <h2>9. Legacy and Transformation</h2>
      <p>Rome did not vanish overnight. Its laws, language, architecture, and institutions shaped medieval and modern Europe. The Church preserved literacy and Roman traditions, while the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire continued to see itself as Rome reborn.</p>

      <blockquote>‚ÄúRome fell because it had turned into an empire without Romans.‚Äù ‚Äî Arnold Toynbee</blockquote>
