    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Ancient China developed along the Yellow (Huang He) and Yangtze rivers and produced one of the world's longest continuous cultural traditions. This page covers the main political periods (Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han) and thematic topics ‚Äî society, belief systems, technology, trade, and legacy.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="geography">
      <h2>Geography & Environment</h2>
      <div class="meta">Rivers, climate, and agricultural zones</div>
      <p>Two river systems anchored early Chinese civilization: the Yellow River in the north with loess soils and seasonal floods, and the Yangtze in the south with wetter rice-growing conditions. Natural barriers ‚Äî mountains, deserts, and steppes ‚Äî shaped interactions with neighboring peoples and encouraged regional variation.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="xia">
      <h2>Xia Dynasty (legendary) ‚Äî c. 2100‚Äì1600 BCE</h2>
      <div class="meta">Status: semi-legendary / archeological debate</div>
      <p>The Xia are recorded in later historical texts (e.g., Shangshu, Records of the Grand Historian) as the first hereditary dynasty. Archaeological cultures (Erlitou) are often associated with early state-level society in the Yellow River valley. Include with caution: textual sources are centuries later and mixed with myth.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="shang">
      <h2>Shang Dynasty ‚Äî c. 1600‚Äì1046 BCE</h2>
      <div class="meta">Early Bronze Age state, oracle-bone script, ritual bronzes</div>
      <h3>Political Structure</h3>
      <p>Monarchical polity with king-priest rulers based at major urban centers (e.g., Anyang/ Yinx). The Shang combined military, ritual, and administrative functions.</p>
      <h3>Writing & Divination</h3>
      <p>Oracle bones show the earliest significant corpus of Chinese writing and were used for divination, recording royal concerns about weather, warfare, harvests, and births.</p>
      <h3>Material Culture</h3>
      <p>Exceptional bronze vessels, weapons, and ritual paraphernalia. Social hierarchy visible in tombs and bronze inscriptions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="zhou">
      <h2>Zhou Dynasty ‚Äî c. 1046‚Äì256 BCE</h2>
      <div class="meta">Western Zhou (early), Eastern Zhou (later) ‚Äî feudal order, Mandate of Heaven</div>
      <p>The Zhou replaced the Shang and developed the political doctrine of the <em>Mandate of Heaven</em>, which justified transfer of rule. The long Zhou span contains two important subsections: the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period.</p>

      <article id="spring-autumn">
        <h3>Spring and Autumn Period (c. 770‚Äì476 BCE)</h3>
        <p>Named after the <em>Spring and Autumn Annals</em>, this era features many small states, frequent diplomatic negotiation, and the rise of regional hegemons (e.g., Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin). Social mobility and the growth of local elites set the stage for intellectual ferment.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="warring-states">
        <h3>Warring States Period (c. 475‚Äì221 BCE)</h3>
        <div class="meta">Consolidation into seven major states, intense war, administrative reform</div>
        <p>By the late Warring States seven principal states dominated the landscape:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Qin</strong> ‚Äî western frontier state that later unified China</li>
          <li><strong>Chu</strong> ‚Äî large southern state with distinctive culture</li>
          <li><strong>Qi</strong> ‚Äî economically and intellectually vibrant on the east coast</li>
          <li><strong>Yan</strong> ‚Äî northern state near the steppe
</li>
          <li><strong>Han</strong> ‚Äî small central state (not the later Han dynasty)
</li>
          <li><strong>Zhao</strong> ‚Äî northern state that adopted cavalry and frontier defenses</li>
          <li><strong>Wei</strong> ‚Äî central plains power that pioneered legal & administrative reforms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warring States rulers implemented large-scale administrative reforms (meritocraticÂÆòÂêè recruitment, taxation, standardization), built large armies, and fostered the intellectual schools known as the Hundred Schools of Thought.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="philosophy-zhou">
        <h3>Philosophy & the Hundred Schools</h3>
        <p>Confucianism (Confucius, Mencius), Daoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi), Legalism (Han Fei), Mohism (Mozi), and other schools debated human nature, governance, and the cosmos. These ideas directly influenced later imperial ideology.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section id="qin">
      <h2>Qin Dynasty ‚Äî 221‚Äì206 BCE</h2>
      <div class="meta">First imperial unification under Qin Shi Huang</div>
      <h3>Unification and Reforms</h3>
      <p>Qin Shi Huang (King of Qin who declared himself First Emperor) completed the military conquest of rival states and implemented sweeping centralizing reforms: standardized script, weights & measures, axle widths, and currency; land and administrative reorganization into commanderies and counties.</p>
      <h3>Infrastructure & Projects</h3>
      <p>Large state projects included roads, canals, and early linking of regional walls that later formed parts of the Great Wall. Massive forced labor projects and harsh Legalist policies led to social strain.</p>
      <h3>Collapse</h3>
      <p>The Qin collapsed quickly after the First Emperor‚Äôs death as rebellions erupted against heavy taxation, conscription, and legal severity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="han">
      <h2>Han Dynasty ‚Äî 206 BCE‚Äì220 CE</h2>
      <div class="meta">Classical imperial China, expansion, Silk Road</div>
      <h3>Western (Former) Han & Eastern (Later) Han</h3>
      <p>The Han established a durable administrative system, a Confucian bureaucratic ideology, and expanded Chinese influence into Central Asia, Korea, and Vietnam. The dynasty is divided into Western Han (capital at Chang'an) and Eastern Han (capital at Luoyang) after a brief Wang Mang usurpation (9‚Äì23 CE).</p>
      <h3>Bureaucracy & Statecraft</h3>
      <p>Han rulers consolidated the civil service and patronized Confucian scholarship; the Five Classics and early imperial examinations shaped elite education (formal civil service exams emerged later, but Han-era institutions laid groundwork).</p>
      <h3>Economy & Trade</h3>
      <p>Silk production, iron metallurgy, coinage, and long-distance trade ‚Äî including early Silk Road exchanges with Central Asia ‚Äî fueled economic growth and cultural exchange.</p>
      <h3>Science & Technology</h3>
      <p>Major technological developments attributed to (or flourishing under) Han: papermaking precursors, astronomical observatories, seismograph prototypes, metallurgy, and advances in medicine and engineering.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="society">
      <h2>Society, Family, & Daily Life</h2>
      <p>Household and kinship were central. agrarian peasantry supported urban elites and the state. Ancestor worship, filial piety, craft specialization, and urban markets shaped daily life. Women held varied roles depending on class and era, from elite influence to peasant labor.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="religion">
      <h2>Religion, Ritual, & Belief</h2>
      <p>Ancestor cults, divination (oracle bones, tortoise plastron), the cult of Heaven (Tian), and later the introduction and sinicization of Buddhism (beginning in the late Han) are central themes. Ritual bronze and tomb practices show concern with afterlife and legitimacy.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="technology">
      <h2>Technology, Art & Writing</h2>
      <p>Bronze casting, lacquerware, jade carving, early writing systems evolving into seal script and clerical script, improved iron tools, crossbows, chariots, and the later diffusion of papermaking and printing technology.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="trade">
      <h2>Trade & Foreign Relations</h2>
      <p>During the Han, trade routes opened to Central Asia (the Silk Road), connecting China to markets and cultures across Eurasia. The frontier required diplomacy and military campaigns against Xiongnu and other steppe groups. The tribute system would later formalize Chinese relations with neighboring polities.</p>

      <h2>Further Reading & Sources</h2>
      <p>Suggested primary and secondary texts, museum collections, and archaeological reports make good starting points. (Add links to library pages, JSTOR, Cambridge histories, or online museum collections.)</p>
    </section>

    <section id="notes">
      <h2>Editorial Notes</h2>
      <p>Dates are conventional and rounded; scholarly debate exists especially for the Xia period and for precise chronology across early Bronze Age contexts. Consider adding city-level subpages (Anyang, Erlitou, Chang'an, Luoyang) and timeline images or maps for visual context.</p>
