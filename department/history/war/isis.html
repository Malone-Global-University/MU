      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        Following the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and the destabilization of Syria during its civil war, ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) emerged as a powerful jihadist organization.  
        The group captured large territories in Iraq and Syria, declared a caliphate in 2014, and committed widespread atrocities against civilians and minorities.

      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>

        Millions of civilians were displaced, and thousands were killed in combat and terror attacks.

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        By 2017, ISIS lost nearly all territorial holdings in Iraq and Syria.

        The conflict reshaped regional politics, highlighted the threat of transnational jihadism, and tested coalition warfare.
