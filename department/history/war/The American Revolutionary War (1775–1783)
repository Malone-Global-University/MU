The American Revolutionary War (1775–1783)
Overview

The American Revolutionary War was the conflict through which the Thirteen American Colonies broke free from British rule to form the United States of America. It was both a war of independence and an ideological revolution that reshaped global ideas of governance and liberty.

Background

Colonial Discontent: After the French and Indian War (1754–1763), Britain imposed new taxes on the colonies (like the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts) to recover debts.

No Taxation Without Representation: Colonists objected, arguing they had no representatives in Parliament.

Growing Resistance: Protests, boycotts, and acts like the Boston Tea Party (1773) deepened the divide.

The Outbreak of War

April 19, 1775 – Battles of Lexington and Concord: “The shot heard ‘round the world.”

Second Continental Congress (1775): Colonies organized a Continental Army, appointing George Washington as Commander-in-Chief.

1776 – Declaration of Independence: Drafted by Thomas Jefferson, it formally severed ties with Britain on July 4, 1776.

Political Innovation: The war paved the way for the U.S. Constitution (1787) and modern democratic governance.

Legacy

The American Revolution was not just a colonial rebellion—it was a philosophical statement that government derives its power from the consent of the governed. It marked a turning point in world history, proving that empires could be challenged and new nations built on principles of liberty and self-determination.
