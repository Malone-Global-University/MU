      <h2>1. Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War occurred between 1846 and 1848, following decades of tension after Mexico‚Äôs independence from Spain in 1821.
        As the United States expanded westward under the ideology of <em>Manifest Destiny</em>, it sought to annex Texas, which had declared independence from Mexico in 1836.
        Mexico never recognized Texas‚Äôs independence and warned that annexation by the U.S. would be considered an act of war.
      </p>
      <p>
        The newly independent Mexican Republic faced political instability, regional divisions, and economic challenges, while the United States was growing rapidly and looking to secure access to the Pacific coast.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Causes and Triggers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annexation of Texas (1845):</strong> The U.S. formally annexed Texas, angering Mexico, which still considered it part of its territory.</li>
        <li><strong>Border dispute:</strong> The U.S. claimed the Rio Grande as the southern boundary of Texas, while Mexico insisted it was the Nueces River.</li>
        <li><strong>Manifest Destiny:</strong> A belief in America‚Äôs divine right to expand westward fueled public and political support for war.</li>
        <li><strong>Diplomatic failure:</strong> President James K. Polk‚Äôs envoy to purchase California and New Mexico was rejected, leading to increased tensions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The immediate trigger came when Mexican and U.S. troops clashed in disputed territory north of the Rio Grande in April 1846.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Key Players and Leadership</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>United States:</strong> President James K. Polk led the expansionist government. 
        Military commanders included General Zachary Taylor (‚ÄúOld Rough and Ready‚Äù), General Winfield Scott, and Colonel Stephen W. Kearny.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mexico:</strong> The Mexican forces were led by General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, who returned from exile to defend his country, alongside regional leaders like Mariano Arista and Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera.

      <h2>4. Military Strategy and Technology</h2>
      <p>
        The war was fought on multiple fronts:
        <ul>
          <li>General Taylor advanced from the Rio Grande into northern Mexico, winning at Palo Alto and Buena Vista.</li>
          <li>General Winfield Scott led an amphibious invasion at Veracruz, then marched inland to capture Mexico City in 1847.</li>
          <li>Colonel Kearny secured New Mexico and California, aided by naval forces and settlers in the short-lived ‚ÄúBear Flag Revolt.‚Äù</li>
        </ul>
        U.S. forces, better supplied and trained, often outmaneuvered Mexican troops. 
        The use of modern artillery and disciplined logistics helped secure decisive victories.

      <h2>5. Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        Mexican civilians endured invasion, occupation, and heavy losses, while American settlers in annexed territories faced new questions of governance and citizenship.
        The war deepened racial and cultural divisions between Anglo settlers and Mexican or Indigenous populations.
        Thousands of civilians were displaced, and property was seized or destroyed during the campaigns.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Outcomes and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The war ended with the <strong>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</strong> (February 2, 1848), in which Mexico ceded over half of its territory ‚Äî including modern-day California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming ‚Äî to the United States.
        In return, the U.S. paid $15 million and assumed certain Mexican debts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The war fulfilled America‚Äôs vision of Manifest Destiny but reignited debates over the expansion of slavery, contributing directly to the tensions that would later spark the U.S. Civil War.
        For Mexico, the loss was catastrophic ‚Äî economically, territorially, and psychologically ‚Äî leading to decades of instability.

      <h2>7. Lessons and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War reshaped the map of North America and demonstrated the growing power of the United States on the global stage.
        It remains controversial: seen by many Mexicans as an unjust invasion, and by many Americans as a fulfillment of national destiny.
        The war exposed the moral and political contradictions of expansionism ‚Äî victory achieved through aggression.
