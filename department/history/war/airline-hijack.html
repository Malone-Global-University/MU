      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The 1970s saw a dramatic rise in aircraft hijackings, often motivated by political goals, terrorism, or demands for ransom.  
        Hijackers targeted flights worldwide, including in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.  
        These incidents highlighted vulnerabilities in aviation security and influenced global counterterrorism policies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of the Hijackings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Political Objectives:</strong> Groups sought attention for nationalist, revolutionary, or ideological causes (e.g., Palestinian liberation groups, left-wing militants).</li>
        <li><strong>Ransom and Criminal Motives:</strong> Some hijackings demanded money or safe passage.</li>
        <li><strong>Weak Aviation Security:</strong> Airports and airlines had minimal security screening, making hijackings easier to execute.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold War Context:</strong> Some incidents were influenced by international tensions and proxy conflicts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="key-figures">
      <h2>Key Figures and Groups</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP):</strong> Carried out several high-profile hijackings.</li>
        <li><strong>Left-Wing European Groups:</strong> Such as the Red Army Faction, involved in hijacking plots.</li>
        <li><strong>Governments & Airlines:</strong> Responded with negotiations, military interventions, and policy changes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="notable-incidents">
      <h2>Notable Hijackings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1970 Dawson’s Field Hijackings:</strong> Multiple aircraft hijacked by the PFLP and diverted to Jordan.</li>
        <li><strong>1972 Sabena Flight 571:</strong> Hijacked by members of the Black September organization in Israel.</li>
        <li><strong>1976 Entebbe Hostage Rescue:</strong> Israeli operation to free hostages held by Palestinian and German hijackers in Uganda.</li>
        <li><strong>Other U.S. Hijackings:</strong> Numerous flights diverted to Cuba, the Middle East, or Latin America for political asylum or demands.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="military-strategy">
      <h2>Response and Security Measures</h2>
      <p>
        Governments and airlines implemented various strategies:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Diplomats often attempted to resolve hijackings peacefully.</li>
          <li><strong>Military Operations:</strong> Special forces were occasionally used, e.g., Operation Entebbe (1976).</li>
          <li><strong>Policy & Security Changes:</strong> Airport screening, metal detectors, and armed air marshals were gradually introduced.</li>
          <li><strong>International Cooperation:</strong> Countries coordinated to prevent hijackings and track hijackers across borders.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="civilian-impact">
      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        Hijackings caused fear and uncertainty for travelers worldwide.  
        Many hostages experienced trauma, and casualties occurred in some incidents.  
        The wave of hijackings shifted public perception of air travel and forced governments to take aviation security seriously.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        By the late 1970s, international aviation security was strengthened.  
        Hijackings declined as airports implemented screenings, reinforced cockpit doors, and adopted counterterrorism protocols.  
        The era established modern norms for handling terrorism and protecting civilians during air travel.

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The 1970s airliner hijackings highlighted the need for coordinated international responses to terrorism.  
        Lessons include the importance of preventive security, crisis management, and balancing negotiation with law enforcement intervention.
