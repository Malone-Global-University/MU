      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to support the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) government against insurgent groups.  
        The war became a prolonged Cold War proxy conflict, with the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and other nations supporting Afghan Mujahideen fighters.

        Millions of Afghan civilians were killed, wounded, or displaced.
