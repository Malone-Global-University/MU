      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        After World War II, Korea was divided along the 38th parallel: the Soviet-backed North and the U.S.-backed South. 
        Rising tensions between communist and non-communist governments, along with unresolved postwar issues, set the stage for armed conflict. 
        In June 1950, North Korean forces invaded South Korea, triggering a three-year war involving international powers.

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of the War</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Division of Korea:</strong> Post-WWII division created two ideologically opposed states.</li>
        <li><strong>Communist Expansion:</strong> North Korea, backed by the USSR and China, sought to unify the peninsula under communism.</li>
        <li><strong>U.S. Containment Policy:</strong> The United States intervened to stop the spread of communism in Asia.</li>
        <li><strong>Failed Diplomacy:</strong> Efforts to negotiate a unified Korean government failed, escalating tensions to war.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="military-strategy">
      <h2>Military Strategy & Major Campaigns</h2>
      <p>
        The Korean War featured conventional warfare with large-scale troop movements, as well as early Cold War-era air and naval operations:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>North Korean Invasion:</strong> Captured Seoul and advanced rapidly southward.</li>
          <li><strong>Inchon Landing:</strong> MacArthur’s amphibious assault cut off North Korean supply lines and retook Seoul.</li>
          <li><strong>Chinese Intervention:</strong> Counteroffensive pushed UN forces back below the 38th parallel.</li>
          <li><strong>Stalemate & Truce:</strong> Frontlines stabilized near the 38th parallel until the 1953 armistice.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="civilian-impact">
      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        Millions of Korean civilians were killed, wounded, or displaced. Cities were destroyed, infrastructure was devastated, 
        and families were separated by the ongoing division of the peninsula. Both sides committed atrocities against civilians during the conflict.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The Korean War ended in an armistice signed on July 27, 1953, creating the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  
        Korea remained divided into North and South, with ongoing military tension.  
        The war solidified U.S. military presence in Asia, influenced Cold War policy, and demonstrated the global stakes of ideological conflicts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The Korean War highlighted the dangers of proxy wars during the Cold War and the challenges of containing communism.  
        It showed the limits of military intervention without political resolution and set a precedent for future U.S. involvement in Asia, including Vietnam.
