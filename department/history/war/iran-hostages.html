      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Iran Hostage Crisis occurred after the Iranian Revolution ousted the Shah and established the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini.  
        On November 4, 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage.  
        The hostages were held for 444 days, straining U.S.-Iran relations and influencing U.S. foreign policy and domestic politics.
