      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2011, widespread protests and uprisings against Muammar Gaddafi’s 42-year authoritarian rule escalated into civil war.  
        NATO intervened under United Nations mandates to enforce a no-fly zone, protect civilians, and support rebel forces, marking a significant episode of modern humanitarian intervention.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of the Intervention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Libyan Civil War:</strong> Anti-Gaddafi uprisings sparked by the Arab Spring.</li>
        <li><strong>Humanitarian Concerns:</strong> Reports of Gaddafi’s forces attacking civilians prompted international response.</li>
        <li><strong>UN Mandate:</strong> United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 authorized military action to protect civilians.</li>
        <li><strong>Geopolitical Interests:</strong> NATO nations aimed to stabilize Libya and prevent regional instability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="key-figures">
      <h2>Key Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Muammar Gaddafi:</strong> Libyan leader resisting the uprising until his death in October 2011.</li>
        <li><strong>UN Security Council:</strong> Authorized military intervention under international law.</li>
        <li><strong>NATO Commanders:</strong> Oversaw airstrikes and enforcement of the no-fly zone.</li>
        <li><strong>National Transitional Council:</strong> Led the rebel forces against Gaddafi’s regime.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="military-strategy">
      <h2>Military Strategy & Operations</h2>
      <p>
        NATO’s campaign included air, naval, and limited ground operations:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No-Fly Zone:</strong> NATO enforced a ban on Gaddafi’s aircraft to prevent attacks on civilians.</li>
          <li><strong>Precision Strikes:</strong> Targeted airstrikes against military assets and command centers.</li>
          <li><strong>Support to Rebels:</strong> Coordinated with National Transitional Council forces to strengthen opposition.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimal Ground Forces:</strong> Intervention primarily relied on air and naval power to reduce coalition casualties.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="civilian-impact">
      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        Civilian casualties occurred during both Gaddafi’s attacks and NATO strikes.  
        Large-scale displacement created refugee crises in neighboring countries.  
        The intervention successfully prevented some atrocities but contributed to long-term instability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        Gaddafi’s regime was toppled, and he was killed in October 2011.  
        Libya transitioned to a fragile state with ongoing political fragmentation and armed militias competing for power.  
        The intervention sparked debate over the effectiveness and unintended consequences of humanitarian military actions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The Libya Intervention illustrates both the potential and limits of humanitarian intervention.  
        Lessons include the importance of post-conflict planning, understanding local dynamics, and preparing for long-term nation-building after military action.
