<section>
  <h2>1. Introduction: The Final Tsar of Russia</h2>
  <p>Nicholas II (1868â€“1918) was the last Emperor of Russia, ruling from 1894 until his abdication in 1917. His reign saw the Russian Empire at its largest territorial extent but also its greatest internal instability. As a deeply religious and autocratic ruler, Nicholas believed his power came directly from God, resisting constitutional reform even as social unrest grew among peasants and industrial workers.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Russia Before the Revolution</h2>
  <p>By the late 19th century, Russia lagged behind Western Europe in industrial development and political modernization. The vast majority of the population were peasants living under poor conditions. Rapid industrialization under Nicholas II created new urban working classes who suffered long hours, low pay, and no political representation.</p>
  <p>The empireâ€™s rigid class system and Nicholasâ€™s resistance to reform alienated both liberal reformers and revolutionary groups such as the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, who sought to overthrow the monarchy entirely.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. The Russo-Japanese War (1904â€“1905)</h2>
  <p>Nicholas IIâ€™s attempt to expand Russian influence in East Asia led to war with Japan, which ended disastrously. The defeat humiliated the empire and exposed deep weaknesses in the military and government bureaucracy. Discontent among the population boiled over into protest.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. The 1905 Revolution and the Duma</h2>
  <p>In January 1905, peaceful protesters led by Father Gapon marched to the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to present a petition for better working conditions. They were fired upon by the Tsarâ€™s troops in what became known as <strong>Bloody Sunday</strong>. The massacre triggered strikes, uprisings, and widespread revolt across the empire.</p>
  <p>In response, Nicholas created the <em>Duma</em> (a national parliament), but he quickly dissolved it whenever it challenged his authority. The promise of reform was largely hollow, and public trust in the monarchy eroded further.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. World War I and the Collapse of the Monarchy</h2>
  <p>When World War I began in 1914, Russia was poorly prepared for modern warfare. Millions of soldiers were killed or captured, and food shortages became severe. Nicholas took personal command of the army in 1915, leaving the government in the hands of Tsarina Alexandra and her controversial adviser, <strong>Grigori Rasputin</strong>.</p>
  <p>Rasputinâ€™s influence and the royal familyâ€™s growing isolation from the suffering public led to widespread rumors of corruption and betrayal. By early 1917, riots and strikes erupted in Petrograd (St. Petersburg), and Nicholas lost control of both the army and the government.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. The February and October Revolutions (1917)</h2>
  <p>In February 1917, soldiers joined the protesters in Petrograd, forcing Nicholas to abdicate the throne. A provisional government was formed but failed to end Russiaâ€™s participation in the war or meet the peopleâ€™s demands for land and peace.</p>
  <p>In October 1917, the Bolsheviks, led by <strong>Vladimir Lenin</strong>, overthrew the provisional government in a nearly bloodless coup. The new communist regime withdrew from World War I and began redistributing land and resources. The Russian Empire was transformed into the worldâ€™s first socialist state: the <em>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)</em>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. The Fate of the Romanovs</h2>
  <p>After his abdication, Nicholas II and his family were placed under house arrest. In July 1918, during the Russian Civil War, they were executed by Bolshevik guards in Yekaterinburg. Their deaths symbolized the definitive end of the old imperial order and the rise of a new revolutionary era.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Legacy and Historical Debate</h2>
  <p>Historians debate whether Nicholas II was a victim of circumstance or the architect of his own downfall. His personal piety and sense of duty could not compensate for his political weakness, inflexibility, and disconnection from the realities of his empire. The revolution that overthrew him reshaped global politics for the next century, inspiring both communist movements and anti-communist responses worldwide.</p>
