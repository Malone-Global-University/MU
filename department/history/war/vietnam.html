      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Vietnam War was a protracted Cold War conflict in Southeast Asia between the communist North Vietnam, supported by the Soviet Union and China, 
        and the U.S.-backed South Vietnam. Rooted in French colonial history, the war escalated as the United States sought to contain the spread of communism under the Domino Theory.

        Millions of Vietnamese civilians were killed, injured, or displaced. Widespread destruction, use of chemical defoliants (Agent Orange),
