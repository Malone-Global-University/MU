      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The War on Drugs began officially in 1971 when U.S. President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one."  
        It expanded in the 1980s and 1990s with policies targeting drug trafficking, distribution, and use, both domestically and internationally.  
        Other countries, particularly in Latin America, also became central to anti-drug campaigns.
