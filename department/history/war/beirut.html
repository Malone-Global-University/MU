      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        During the Lebanese Civil War, U.S. and French peacekeeping forces were stationed in Beirut as part of a multinational force attempting to stabilize the region.  
        On October 23, 1983, suicide bombers attacked the U.S. Marine barracks, killing 241 American servicemen, and simultaneously attacked the French paratroopers’ barracks, killing 58.  
        These attacks were the deadliest single-day attacks on U.S. Marines at the time and marked a turning point in U.S. involvement in Lebanon.
