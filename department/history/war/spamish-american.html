      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        By the late 19th century, Spain had lost most of its empire but retained colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. 
        The United States, experiencing industrial growth and expanding its influence, was increasingly drawn into overseas affairs. 
        Cuban revolts against Spanish rule captured American attention, fueled by sensationalist journalism and a desire to protect U.S. economic interests.

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of the War</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cuban Independence Movement:</strong> Cuban rebels fought Spain, which threatened U.S. trade and raised humanitarian concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>USS <em>Maine</em> Explosion:</strong> The battleship exploded in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, killing 266 Americans; newspapers blamed Spain.</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow Journalism:</strong> Sensationalized reporting increased public pressure on the U.S. government to act.</li>
        <li><strong>Imperialist Ambitions:</strong> Expansionists in the U.S. saw an opportunity to acquire overseas territories and project power globally.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="key-figures">
      <h2>Key Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>President William McKinley:</strong> Led the United States into war, initially seeking a diplomatic resolution.</li>
        <li><strong>Theodore Roosevelt:</strong> Assistant Secretary of the Navy and leader of the Rough Riders; gained national fame at the Battle of San Juan Hill.</li>
        <li><strong>Admiral George Dewey:</strong> Commanded the U.S. Navy in the decisive victory at Manila Bay in the Philippines.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen Regent Maria Christina and Spanish Military Leaders:</strong> Oversaw Spain’s colonial forces during the conflict.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="military-strategy">
      <h2>Military Strategy & Major Campaigns</h2>
      <p>
        The U.S. executed a coordinated land and naval strategy:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cuba:</strong> U.S. Navy blockaded Havana; ground forces, including the Rough Riders, fought battles at San Juan Hill and Santiago.</li>
          <li><strong>Philippines:</strong> Admiral Dewey destroyed the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay, securing the Philippines with minimal casualties.</li>
          <li><strong>Puerto Rico:</strong> U.S. forces landed and quickly occupied the island with limited resistance.</li>
        </ul>
        Rapid mobilization, superior naval power, and Spain’s weakened military ensured a swift U.S. victory.

    <section id="civilian-impact">
      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        Civilians in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines endured battles, occupation, and disruption of daily life. 
        Many Cuban and Filipino insurgents initially welcomed U.S. forces but later resisted American control in the Philippines. 
        The war demonstrated the growing global reach of American military power and foreshadowed the U.S.’s role in 20th-century conflicts.

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The Treaty of Paris (December 10, 1898) ended the war:  
        - Spain recognized Cuban independence.  
        - The U.S. acquired Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines for $20 million.  
        - The United States emerged as a global power with overseas territories.
      </p>
      <p>
        The war marked the beginning of U.S. imperialism, influenced debates over colonialism and democracy, and enhanced national pride.
      </p>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The Spanish–American War reshaped global power dynamics, signaling the U.S.’s rise on the world stage. 
        It raised ethical questions about imperialism, sovereignty, and intervention in foreign conflicts, many of which remain relevant today.
