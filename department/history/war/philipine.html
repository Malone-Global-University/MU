      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        After the United States defeated Spain in 1898, the Treaty of Paris transferred control of the Philippines from Spain to the U.S. 
        Filipino revolutionaries, who had fought for independence from Spain, expected self-governance, not new colonial rule. 
        Tensions escalated as the U.S. established a military government, leading to open conflict in February 1899.

      <h2>Key Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emilio Aguinaldo:</strong> Leader of the Filipino independence movement and first president of the Philippine Republic.</li>
        <li><strong>General Arthur MacArthur Jr.:</strong> U.S. military commander during the war’s early campaigns.</li>

    <section id="military-strategy">
      <h2>Military Strategy & Major Campaigns</h2>
      <p>
        The war featured guerrilla warfare by Filipino forces and conventional operations by the U.S. Army. 
        The U.S. employed superior firepower, artillery, and counterinsurgency tactics, including “reconcentrado” policies that relocated civilians to prevent support for guerrillas. 
        Key campaigns included battles in Manila, Northern Luzon, and the southern provinces. 
        Aguinaldo was captured in 1901, which largely ended organized resistance, though sporadic fighting continued for years.

      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        The war caused immense civilian suffering, including famine, disease, and widespread displacement. 
        Estimates suggest tens of thousands of Filipino civilians died, while the conflict deeply disrupted social and economic life.

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The war officially ended in 1902, with the U.S. establishing colonial rule over the Philippines. 
        The Philippines remained under U.S. administration until 1946, when full independence was granted. 
        The conflict demonstrated the U.S.’s emerging role as a global power and the ethical dilemmas of imperialism.

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The Philippine–American War exposed the contradictions of U.S. democracy and imperialism. 
        While the United States promoted freedom abroad, it suppressed self-determination in the Philippines. 
        The war also influenced American military strategy, counterinsurgency doctrine, and debates over colonial governance.
