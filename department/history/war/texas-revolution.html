      <h2>1. Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Texas Revolution was a rebellion of colonists from the United States and Tejano (Mexican-born Texan) residents against the central government of Mexico. 
        It took place between October 1835 and April 1836, culminating in the creation of the independent Republic of Texas.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, its government invited settlers from the United States to populate the sparsely inhabited northern frontier of Texas. 
        Over time, tensions rose as Anglo-American settlers brought enslaved labor and sought greater autonomy, clashing with Mexico’s anti-slavery policies and centralization under President Antonio López de Santa Anna.

      <h2>2. Causes and Triggers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Centralization of power:</strong> Santa Anna’s move to dismantle Mexico’s federal system in favor of a centralized dictatorship alienated many provinces, including Texas.</li>
        <li><strong>Slavery and cultural conflict:</strong> Mexico’s 1829 abolition of slavery angered many Anglo settlers who relied on enslaved labor for cotton production.</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomy and local rights:</strong> Texians sought more self-governance, local militias, and control over immigration and trade.</li>
        <li><strong>Military repression:</strong> Mexican troops were sent to enforce Mexican authority, leading to open rebellion at Gonzales in 1835 — where the slogan “Come and Take It” was born.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Key Players and Leadership</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Texian Forces:</strong> Led by figures such as Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin, and William B. Travis. 
        Other key participants included Davy Crockett and James Bowie, who became folk heroes after the Battle of the Alamo.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mexican Government:</strong> President and General Antonio López de Santa Anna commanded the Mexican army, determined to suppress the rebellion and preserve national unity.

      <h2>4. Military Strategy and Technology</h2>
      <p>
        The conflict began with small skirmishes, including the Battle of Gonzales (October 1835), and escalated with the Texian siege of San Antonio.
        In March 1836, Santa Anna’s forces captured the Alamo after a brutal 13-day siege, killing nearly all defenders.
        Soon after, Mexican troops executed over 300 captured Texans at the Goliad Massacre.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these defeats, Sam Houston’s army regrouped and launched a surprise attack at the <strong>Battle of San Jacinto</strong> on April 21, 1836, capturing Santa Anna and forcing him to sign the Treaties of Velasco, recognizing Texas independence.

      <h2>5. Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        The revolution displaced many families and destroyed settlements on both sides. 
        Tejanos who supported independence faced suspicion and persecution afterward.
        The war also deepened divisions between Anglo settlers and Indigenous groups, who found themselves caught between warring armies and shifting borders.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Outcomes and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The Revolution established the <strong>Republic of Texas</strong>, an independent nation recognized by the United States, Britain, and France. 
        However, Mexico refused to recognize the new republic’s sovereignty and vowed to reclaim the territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new Texas government legalized slavery, aligned economically with the United States, and sought eventual annexation — achieved in 1845, setting the stage for the <a href="/wars/mexican-american-war.html">Mexican–American War</a>.

      <h2>7. Lessons and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Texas Revolution is often celebrated in American culture as a fight for liberty, but its legacy is complex. 
        It involved issues of slavery, racial hierarchy, and territorial ambition as much as ideals of self-determination.
        For Mexico, it represented a painful loss of sovereignty and control; for the United States, it was a prelude to continental expansion and later conflict.
