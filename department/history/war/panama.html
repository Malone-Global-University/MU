      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Invasion of Panama</strong>, code-named <em>Operation Just Cause</em>, began on <strong>December 20, 1989</strong>. 
        It marked one of the largest U.S. military actions since the Vietnam War and the last major operation of the Cold War era.
      </p>
      <p>
        The operation aimed to depose <strong>General Manuel Noriega</strong>, who had seized power and was implicated in drug trafficking, election fraud, and suppression of democratic opposition. 
        Noriega had previously been a U.S. intelligence asset, but his growing independence and alliance with drug cartels turned Washington against him.

      <h2>Causes of the Conflict</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drug Trafficking Allegations:</strong> Noriega was indicted in U.S. courts for smuggling cocaine and laundering drug money through Panamanian banks.</li>
        <li><strong>Threat to American Citizens:</strong> Rising violence endangered the large U.S. community living in Panama, particularly near the Canal Zone.</li>
        <li><strong>Democratic Breakdown:</strong> The annulment of Panama’s 1989 presidential election, which Noriega’s opponent Guillermo Endara had won.</li>
        <li><strong>Canal Security:</strong> The U.S. sought to ensure a stable government ahead of the planned <strong>1999 transfer</strong> of the Panama Canal under the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Invasion</h2>
      <p>
        On December 20, 1989, approximately <strong>27,000 U.S. troops</strong> entered Panama, joining 12,000 already stationed there. 
        The assault targeted key military installations, command centers, and Noriega’s headquarters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite limited resistance, heavy fighting broke out in densely populated areas such as El Chorrillo, resulting in significant civilian casualties and property destruction.

      <h2>Aftermath and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        Noriega surrendered on <strong>January 3, 1990</strong> after taking refuge in the Vatican embassy. He was extradited to the United States, convicted of drug charges, and imprisoned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The invasion resulted in over <strong>500 Panamanian civilian deaths</strong> (some estimates far higher) and strained U.S.–Latin American relations. Critics accused Washington of violating international law and using excessive force for political purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, the U.S. established a civilian government under Guillermo Endara and reaffirmed its commitment to the peaceful transfer of the Panama Canal.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Invasion of Panama served as a <strong>blueprint for U.S. interventions</strong> in the post–Cold War era — combining rapid deployment, information control, and humanitarian justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also set the stage for later debates about <strong>sovereignty, regime change, and the limits of American power</strong> abroad.
