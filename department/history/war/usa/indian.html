    <h1>The Indian Wars (1622â€“1890)</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Conflicts Between the United States and Native Nations â€” Resistance, Displacement, and Expansion</p>
  </section>

  <main>
    <section id="context">
      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Indian Wars were a series of conflicts spanning nearly three centuries between European colonists, later the United States, and Native American nations. 
        Beginning with early colonial clashes such as the 1622 Powhatan uprising in Virginia, these wars intensified after U.S. independence as settlers moved westward. 
        Native Americans resisted encroachment on their lands, defending traditional territories across the Great Plains, Midwest, Southwest, and Pacific Northwest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wars coincided with major U.S. events: westward expansion after the Louisiana Purchase, the Mexicanâ€“American War, and post-Civil War settlement. 
        Policies such as forced removal, reservations, and assimilation efforts accompanied military campaigns, fundamentally altering Native societies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of the Conflicts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Land and Resource Pressure:</strong> Settlers moved into traditional Native lands for farming, mining, and ranching.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansionist Policies:</strong> Federal laws, treaties, and acts like the Indian Removal Act facilitated U.S. territorial acquisition.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Clashes:</strong> Conflicts over sovereignty, religion, and governance fueled hostilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Resistance to Removal:</strong> Many Native nations resisted forced relocation and defended sacred and economic lands.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="key-figures">
      <h2>Key Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Native Leaders:</strong> Tecumseh (Shawnee), Red Cloud (Oglala Lakota), Sitting Bull (Hunkpapa Lakota), Geronimo (Apache)</li>
        <li><strong>U.S. Military Figures:</strong> William Tecumseh Sherman, George Armstrong Custer, Philip Sheridan</li>
        <li><strong>Political Leaders:</strong> Andrew Jackson (Indian Removal), U.S. Presidents shaping westward policy</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="military-strategy">
      <h2>Military Strategy & Major Campaigns</h2>
      <p>
        Strategies included frontier skirmishes, fort construction, and large-scale campaigns:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Early Colonial Wars:</strong> Powhatan Wars, Pequot War, King Philipâ€™s War</li>
          <li><strong>19th Century Plains Wars:</strong> Red Cloudâ€™s War, Great Sioux War (including the Battle of the Little Bighorn)</li>
          <li><strong>Southwest Conflicts:</strong> Apache Wars, including Geronimoâ€™s campaigns</li>
          <li><strong>Final Conflicts:</strong> Nez Perce War (1877), Wounded Knee Massacre (1890)</li>
        </ul>
        U.S. forces relied on superior numbers, artillery, and rail transport. Native forces employed guerrilla tactics, ambushes, and knowledge of terrain.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="civilian-impact">
      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        Native communities faced displacement, starvation, and massacres. Families were broken apart, and cultural traditions were suppressed. 
        Many were forced onto reservations, where poverty, disease, and dependency on government rations replaced traditional lifeways. 
        Settlers were often caught in raids and retaliations, though casualties were disproportionately higher for Native nations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        By 1890, U.S. federal forces had effectively subdued Native resistance. The Wounded Knee Massacre symbolized the violent end of large-scale Native armed resistance. 
        The wars facilitated U.S. continental expansion, the creation of the reservation system, and the near-complete dispossession of Indigenous lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The legacy includes deep social and economic disparities for Native Americans, the loss of sovereignty, and enduring cultural trauma, but also stories of resilience and preservation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The Indian Wars highlight the human cost of expansion and the consequences of cultural misunderstanding, greed, and systemic violence. 
        They offer critical lessons about sovereignty, ethics in warfare, and the responsibilities of nations toward Indigenous peoples.
