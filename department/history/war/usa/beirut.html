      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        During the Lebanese Civil War, U.S. and French peacekeeping forces were stationed in Beirut as part of a multinational force attempting to stabilize the region.  
        On October 23, 1983, suicide bombers attacked the U.S. Marine barracks, killing 241 American servicemen, and simultaneously attacked the French paratroopersâ€™ barracks, killing 58.  
        These attacks were the deadliest single-day attacks on U.S. Marines at the time and marked a turning point in U.S. involvement in Lebanon.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lebanese Civil War:</strong> Sectarian violence and factional conflict destabilized Beirut.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-Western Sentiment:</strong> Militant groups opposed foreign military presence, particularly U.S. and French forces.</li>
        <li><strong>Iranian & Syrian Influence:</strong> Groups like Hezbollah were reportedly backed by Iran and Syria, seeking to expel Western forces.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeting Peacekeepers:</strong> The multinational force was viewed as interfering in internal Lebanese politics.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section id="military-strategy">
      <h2>Attack Strategy & Operations</h2>
      <p>
        The bombings were coordinated suicide attacks:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>U.S. Barracks Attack:</strong> Truck bomb exploded at the Marine barracks in Beirut International Airport, killing 241 Marines.</li>
          <li><strong>French Barracks Attack:</strong> Simultaneous suicide bombing killed 58 French paratroopers.</li>
          <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> High-explosive vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) designed for maximum destruction.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Exposed vulnerabilities of conventional military forces in urban peacekeeping environments.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="civilian-impact">
      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        While the attacks targeted military forces, surrounding areas were damaged, and civilians in Beirut suffered injuries and trauma.  
        The bombings intensified instability in Lebanon and undermined confidence in foreign intervention as a stabilizing force.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The attacks led to the withdrawal of U.S. and French forces from Beirut in 1984.  
        The events shaped U.S. foreign policy toward Middle East peacekeeping and counterterrorism.  
        Hezbollah gained notoriety, demonstrating the effectiveness of asymmetrical urban attacks against conventional forces.

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The 1983 Beirut bombings highlighted the dangers of peacekeeping in volatile regions and the emergence of suicide attacks as a tactic.
