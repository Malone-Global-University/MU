      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The American Civil War erupted after decades of tension between the Northern and Southern states 
        over slavery, economic differences, and the balance of power in Congress. 
        By the mid-19th century, the United States had grown rapidly westward, 
        and debates over whether new territories would allow slavery created deep political fractures. 
        The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 ‚Äî without a single Southern electoral vote ‚Äî 
        convinced Southern leaders that their way of life was under existential threat.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of the War</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Slavery and Expansion:</strong> Disputes over whether slavery should spread into new western territories.</li>
        <li><strong>States‚Äô Rights vs. Federal Authority:</strong> Southern states claimed the right to secede and govern independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Divide:</strong> The industrial North favored tariffs and modernization; the agrarian South depended on enslaved labor.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Breakdown:</strong> The collapse of compromise ‚Äî from the Missouri Compromise to the Kansas-Nebraska Act ‚Äî destroyed trust between regions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="key-figures">
      <h2>Key Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Abraham Lincoln:</strong> President of the United States; issued the Emancipation Proclamation and led the Union to victory.</li>
        <li><strong>Jefferson Davis:</strong> President of the Confederate States of America; led the secessionist government.</li>
        <li><strong>Ulysses S. Grant:</strong> Union general who accepted Lee‚Äôs surrender at Appomattox.</li>
        <li><strong>Robert E. Lee:</strong> Confederate general known for his tactical brilliance and eventual defeat.</li>
        <li><strong>Frederick Douglass:</strong> Abolitionist leader and powerful advocate for Black soldiers and emancipation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="military-strategy">
      <h2>Military Strategy & Major Campaigns</h2>
      <p>
        The Union‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnaconda Plan‚Äù sought to blockade Southern ports and control the Mississippi River to cut off Confederate supplies. 
        The Confederacy, outnumbered but defensive, relied on superior knowledge of terrain and hoped for European recognition. 
        Key battles included Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg, and Sherman‚Äôs March to the Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technological innovations ‚Äî like the telegraph, rail transport, and rifled muskets ‚Äî transformed warfare into an industrial struggle.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="civilian-impact">
      <h2>Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        The war devastated Southern cities and farmlands, displaced millions, and redefined the social order. 
        Over 620,000 soldiers died, and countless civilians suffered famine, disease, and loss. 
        Enslaved people fled plantations in massive numbers, joining the Union war effort or seeking freedom behind Northern lines.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Reconstruction</h2>
      <p>
        The Union emerged victorious in 1865, preserving the United States and ending slavery nationwide through the Thirteenth Amendment. 
        Yet the postwar Reconstruction period revealed how fragile the victory was ‚Äî 
        racial violence, political resistance, and economic inequality persisted for generations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The Civil War stands as both a tragedy and a rebirth. 
        It defined the nation‚Äôs moral boundaries and constitutional identity, 
        but also exposed how deeply ideology can divide a people. 
        The war‚Äôs legacy lives on in debates over civil rights, federal power, and the meaning of equality.
