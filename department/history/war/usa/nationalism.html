      <h2>The Rise of Nationalism in Colonial America</h2>
      <p>How did the thirteen colonies grow from scattered settlements into a unified people ready to form a nation?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>1. Shared Colonial Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Though founded separately with different economies and faiths, the colonies developed a shared outlook by the 1700s. 
        They governed themselves through local assemblies and grew frustrated by British interference and taxation without representation. 
        Distance from Britain fostered independence and self-reliance.

      <h3>2. The Great Awakening (1730s–1740s)</h3>
      <p>
        Traveling preachers like <strong>George Whitefield</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Edwards</strong> inspired people across the colonies, breaking regional barriers. 
        This religious revival encouraged individuals to question authority—both spiritual and political—helping lay the groundwork for revolution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>3. Enlightenment Thought</h3>
      <p>
        Ideas from European philosophers such as <strong>John Locke</strong> emphasized natural rights and government by consent. 
        Colonial leaders like <strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong>, <strong>John Adams</strong>, and <strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong> applied these principles to justify independence and self-rule.

    <section>
      <h3>4. Economic Independence</h3>
      <p>
        Colonies built their own trade networks and industries, yet Britain restricted commerce under its mercantilist system. 
        Acts like the <em>Navigation Acts</em> limited trade freedom, leading colonists to see that prosperity was possible without British control.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>5. The French and Indian War (1754–1763)</h3>
      <p>
        The war united colonists against a common foe but revealed British arrogance. 
        When Britain taxed the colonies afterward to pay war debts, resentment deepened through laws like the <em>Stamp Act</em> and <em>Townshend Acts</em>. 
        The colonies began to act together in protest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>6. Communication and Cooperation</h3>
      <p>
        Newspapers, pamphlets like <em>Common Sense</em>, and networks such as the <strong>Committees of Correspondence</strong> spread revolutionary ideas. 
        Shared slogans—“<em>No taxation without representation</em>”—and symbols like the <strong>Liberty Tree</strong> unified the colonies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>7. The Birth of an American Identity</h3>
      <p>
        By the 1770s, colonists began to view themselves as <strong>Americans</strong> rather than British subjects. 
        They prized freedom, local democracy, and independence. 
        The Revolution became not just a war for liberty but the formation of a new national consciousness.
