      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Invasion of Grenada, codenamed <strong>Operation Urgent Fury</strong>, was a U.S.-led military intervention that began on October 25, 1983.  
        It followed a coup and the execution of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.  
        Concerned about the safety of American medical students and the rise of a Marxist government allied with Cuba and the Soviet Union,  
        the United States intervened to restore order and install a pro-Western government.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of the Invasion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Marxist Regime:</strong> Bishop‚Äôs New Jewel Movement aligned with Cuba and the Soviet bloc, alarming Washington.</li>
        <li><strong>Military Coup:</strong> Internal power struggle led to Bishop‚Äôs execution and the establishment of a military junta.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold War Politics:</strong> U.S. sought to prevent another communist foothold in the Caribbean after Cuba.</li>
        <li><strong>American Citizens at Risk:</strong> About 600 U.S. medical students were on the island when the crisis erupted.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="key-figures">
      <h2>Key Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ronald Reagan:</strong> U.S. President who authorized the invasion, citing regional stability and citizen safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Maurice Bishop:</strong> Prime Minister of Grenada (1979‚Äì1983), overthrown and executed before the invasion.</li>
        <li><strong>Hudson Austin:</strong> Leader of the Revolutionary Military Council that took power after Bishop‚Äôs death.</li>
        <li><strong>Cuban Engineers and Advisors:</strong> Assisted in constructing the Point Salines airstrip, viewed by the U.S. as a potential military base.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="military-operation">
      <h2>Military Operation</h2>
      <p>
        Operation Urgent Fury began with U.S. Army Rangers, Marines, and Navy SEALs launching a rapid invasion.  
        The operation faced stronger resistance than anticipated from Grenadian and Cuban forces.  
        Within a week, U.S. forces secured the island, rescued American citizens, and installed an interim government.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Date:</strong> October 25 ‚Äì November 2, 1983</li>
        <li><strong>Forces Involved:</strong> About 7,600 U.S. troops, plus forces from the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="international-response">
      <h2>International Response</h2>
      <p>
        The invasion drew international criticism.  
        The United Nations General Assembly condemned it as a violation of international law,  
        while the Reagan administration defended it as a necessary act of regional security and humanitarian protection.  
        Britain, the former colonial power, was not consulted and expressed disapproval.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The U.S. quickly achieved its military objectives.  
        A democratic government was restored, and U.S. influence in the Caribbean increased.  
        The invasion demonstrated U.S. willingness to act unilaterally in its perceived sphere of influence during the Cold War.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the operation also exposed weaknesses in U.S. interservice communication, prompting reforms in military coordination  
        that later influenced the <strong>Goldwater‚ÄìNichols Act of 1986</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        Operation Urgent Fury reinforced U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere and sent a message to Soviet-aligned nations.  
        It also raised questions about the legality of preemptive intervention.  
        For the U.S. military, it was both a quick victory and a case study in joint operations and media control.
