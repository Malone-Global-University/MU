      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The rise of nationalism in colonial America was not a sudden revolution but a gradual awakening. 
        Over a century and a half, English colonists developed new habits of thought, politics, and community life 
        that led them to see themselves as something more than subjects of a distant crown. By 1776, they had forged a 
        new sense of identityâ€”one rooted in liberty, equality, and self-government.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="foundations">
      <h2>1. Foundations of the Colonies (1607â€“1700): Distant Loyalties</h2>
      <p>
        Early settlers in Jamestown and Plymouth viewed themselves as loyal Englishmen. 
        They brought with them English traditions, legal systems, and religious values. 
        Yet across the Atlantic, they learned to solve problems independently, creating local governments 
        like New Englandâ€™s <strong>town meetings</strong> and Virginiaâ€™s <strong>House of Burgesses</strong>. 
        These institutions laid the groundwork for self-rule and the belief that people could govern themselves effectively.

    <section id="american-identity">
      <h2>2. The Growth of an American Identity (1700â€“1750): A People Apart</h2>
      <p>
        By the 18th century, generations born in America began to feel distinct from those in Britain. 
        Prosperous trade, growing towns, and colonial newspapers helped spread ideas and unity. 
        The <strong>Great Awakening</strong> inspired people to question authority and embrace equality before Godâ€” 
        planting the seeds of democratic thought that would later fuel political independence.

    <section id="french-indian-war">
      <h2>3. The French and Indian War (1754â€“1763): A Common Struggle</h2>
      <p>
        The war against France united colonists under a shared military cause. 
        Fighting alongside British troops, Americans gained confidence in their strength and abilities. 
        However, British officers often dismissed colonial soldiers as inferior. 
        This tension deepened the divide between the two peoples. 
        After victory, colonists expected gratitude and respectâ€”but Britain instead imposed tighter control and new taxes.
      </p>

    <section id="imperial-crisis">
      <h2>4. The Imperial Crisis (1763â€“1775): From Protest to Patriotism</h2>
      <p>
        Britainâ€™s new policiesâ€”the <strong>Proclamation of 1763</strong>, <strong>Stamp Act</strong>, and <strong>Townshend Acts</strong>â€”sparked outrage. 
        Americans argued that taxation without representation violated their rights as Englishmen. 
        The <strong>Stamp Act Congress</strong> and organizations like the <strong>Sons of Liberty</strong> coordinated resistance, 
        spreading revolutionary ideas through pamphlets and newspapers. 
        Events like the <strong>Boston Massacre</strong> and <strong>Tea Party</strong> solidified unity against British oppression.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="revolution">
      <h2>5. Revolution and the Birth of a Nation (1775â€“1776): The American Identity Fully Formed</h2>
      <p>
        The battles of <strong>Lexington and Concord</strong> ignited open rebellion. 
        What began as a protest for rights evolved into a war for independence. 
        <strong>Thomas Paineâ€™s</strong> <em>Common Sense</em> urged Americans to abandon monarchy entirely and 
        embrace republican self-rule. The <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong>, written by <strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>, 
        declared that all men are created equal and that the colonies were now a free and sovereign people. 
        The idea of America as a nationâ€”united by principles rather than ancestryâ€”was born.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>6. Legacy: The Meaning of American Nationalism</h2>
      <p>
        American nationalism was built not on bloodlines but on ideals: liberty, equality, and democracy. 
        It began as resistance to imperial control and evolved into a belief in universal rights and self-government. 
        The spirit that emerged in the 18th century would shape the nationâ€™s future, inspiring movements for freedom across the world.
