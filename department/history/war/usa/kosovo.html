      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Kosovo War</strong> was fought between the <strong>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)</strong> and the <strong>ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)</strong> from 1998 to 1999.  
        The conflict was part of the broader Yugoslav Wars and stemmed from Kosovo’s demand for independence and Serbia’s campaign to suppress it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Widespread atrocities against Kosovar Albanians led to a <strong>NATO air campaign</strong> — the first war fought by the alliance without UN authorization.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Causes of the War</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ethnic and Political Tensions:</strong> Kosovo’s Albanian majority demanded autonomy from Serb control.</li>
        <li><strong>Serbian Nationalism:</strong> Slobodan Milošević’s government sought to maintain Serbian sovereignty and suppress separatism.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Rights Violations:</strong> Reports of massacres and forced expulsions of Albanians triggered international outrage.</li>
        <li><strong>Failed Diplomacy:</strong> Peace talks in Rambouillet, France collapsed after Serbia refused NATO troop deployment terms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The NATO Intervention</h2>
      <p>
        In March 1999, NATO launched <strong>Operation Allied Force</strong>, a 78-day bombing campaign targeting Serbian military and infrastructure sites.  
        The goal was to compel Milošević to withdraw forces from Kosovo and end the campaign of ethnic cleansing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The operation was controversial: it achieved its military objectives but also caused civilian casualties and destroyed Yugoslav infrastructure.
      </p>

      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Serbian Withdrawal:</strong> Milošević agreed to withdraw troops after sustained NATO airstrikes.</li>
        <li><strong>UN Administration:</strong> Kosovo was placed under UN control (UNMIK) and NATO peacekeepers (KFOR) entered the region.</li>
        <li><strong>Refugee Crisis:</strong> Over 1 million people were displaced during the war.</li>
        <li><strong>War Crimes:</strong> The International Criminal Tribunal indicted Milošević and other Serbian leaders for crimes against humanity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Kosovo’s Independence</h2>
      <p>
        Kosovo declared independence in <strong>2008</strong>, recognized by most Western nations but not by Serbia, Russia, or China.  
        Its status remains a contentious issue in international politics and Balkan stability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Kosovo War cemented NATO’s role as an enforcer of humanitarian norms in post–Cold War Europe.  
        It raised enduring debates about <strong>sovereignty versus human rights</strong> and the legality of intervention without UN approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conflict also exposed divisions between the West and Russia, which persist in global politics today.
