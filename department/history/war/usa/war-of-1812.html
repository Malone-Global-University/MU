      <h2>1. Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The War of 1812 took place between the United States and the British Empire from 1812 to 1815.
        It occurred during the wider Napoleonic Wars in Europe, when Britain was preoccupied with defeating France.
        The young United States, less than four decades after independence, faced ongoing issues with British interference in trade and the forced conscription of American sailors.
        On the western frontier, Native American nations resisted U.S. expansion with British support, creating a broader struggle over the future of North America.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Causes and Triggers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Impressment of sailors:</strong> The British Navy forcibly enlisted American sailors, claiming they were deserters from British ships.</li>
        <li><strong>Trade restrictions:</strong> Britain‚Äôs blockade of Napoleonic Europe disrupted American commerce and provoked economic retaliation.</li>
        <li><strong>Native alliances:</strong> British forces armed and encouraged Native resistance in the Northwest Territory.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansionism:</strong> Many U.S. ‚ÄúWar Hawks‚Äù in Congress sought to annex Canada and secure western lands.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The immediate trigger came in June 1812 when the U.S. declared war after repeated diplomatic failures with Britain.

      <h2>3. Key Players and Leadership</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>United States:</strong> President James Madison led the nation into war, supported by politicians like Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. 
        Military figures included General William Henry Harrison and naval hero Oliver Hazard Perry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>British Empire:</strong> Britain‚Äôs North American forces were commanded by generals such as Sir Isaac Brock and later George Prevost. 
        The British also relied on alliances with Native American leaders, notably Tecumseh of the Shawnee, who sought to resist U.S. expansion.

      <h2>4. Military Strategy and Technology</h2>
      <p>
        The war featured multiple fronts ‚Äî the Great Lakes, the Canadian border, the Atlantic coast, and the American South.
        Early U.S. invasions of Canada failed, while the British successfully defended key territories. 
        At sea, however, the U.S. Navy achieved surprising victories with smaller ships like the USS Constitution (‚ÄúOld Ironsides‚Äù).
        In 1814, British troops invaded Washington D.C., burning the White House and Capitol, but were later repelled at Baltimore, where the ‚ÄúStar-Spangled Banner‚Äù was written.

      <h2>5. Impact on Civilians</h2>
      <p>
        Civilians suffered from disrupted trade, blockades, and local invasions. 
        Native American communities faced devastating losses as their alliances with Britain collapsed. 
        In the South, the Creek War (1813‚Äì1814), intertwined with the larger conflict, led to significant land cessions to the U.S. government.
        The war also fueled a sense of nationalism among Americans, especially after victories at Baltimore and New Orleans.

      <h2>6. Outcomes and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The Treaty of Ghent (signed December 24, 1814) ended the war and restored pre-war boundaries without territorial changes.
        While the treaty did not resolve maritime issues, the end of the Napoleonic Wars soon made them irrelevant.
        The conflict boosted American pride and confirmed U.S. sovereignty.
        Native resistance east of the Mississippi was largely crushed, paving the way for westward expansion.
        The war also marked the decline of the Federalist Party, which had opposed the war, and elevated figures like Andrew Jackson to national prominence.

      <h2>7. Lessons and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The War of 1812 is often called America‚Äôs ‚ÄúSecond War of Independence.‚Äù
        It taught the young nation the importance of military readiness, naval power, and internal unity.
        For Britain, the war reaffirmed control of Canada and solidified peaceful coexistence with the U.S. thereafter.
        For Native nations, it was a tragic turning point that accelerated U.S. territorial dominance.
