      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Iraq War began in March 2003 when a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein’s regime, citing alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and links to terrorism.  
        The conflict transitioned into a prolonged insurgency, sectarian violence, and nation-building effort, lasting until 2011 when U.S. forces withdrew.
