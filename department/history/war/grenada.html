      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Invasion of Grenada, codenamed <strong>Operation Urgent Fury</strong>, was a U.S.-led military intervention that began on October 25, 1983.  
        It followed a coup and the execution of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.  
        Concerned about the safety of American medical students and the rise of a Marxist government allied with Cuba and the Soviet Union,  
        the United States intervened to restore order and install a pro-Western government.

    <section id="international-response">
      <h2>International Response</h2>
      <p>
        The invasion drew international criticism.  
        The United Nations General Assembly condemned it as a violation of international law,  
        while the Reagan administration defended it as a necessary act of regional security and humanitarian protection.  
        Britain, the former colonial power, was not consulted and expressed disapproval.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome and Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        The U.S. quickly achieved its military objectives.  
        A democratic government was restored, and U.S. influence in the Caribbean increased.  
        The invasion demonstrated U.S. willingness to act unilaterally in its perceived sphere of influence during the Cold War.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the operation also exposed weaknesses in U.S. interservice communication, prompting reforms in military coordination  
        that later influenced the <strong>Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986</strong>.

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        Operation Urgent Fury reinforced U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere and sent a message to Soviet-aligned nations.  
        It also raised questions about the legality of preemptive intervention.  
        For the U.S. military, it was both a quick victory and a case study in joint operations and media control.
