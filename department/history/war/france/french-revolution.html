  <h2>1. The Origins of Revolution (1789â€“1792)</h2>
  <p>The French Revolution began in 1789 as a direct response to centuries of inequality under the Ancien RÃ©gime. The clergy and nobility enjoyed vast privileges while the Third Estate â€” composed of commoners, merchants, and peasants â€” carried the burden of heavy taxation. Economic crisis, food shortages, and Enlightenment ideals combined to ignite revolt.</p>
  <p>When King Louis XVI called the Estates-General, the Third Estate transformed itself into the National Assembly, declaring itself the true representative of the French people. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, became a symbol of the people's demand for liberty and justice.</p>

  <h2>2. Radicalization and the Reign of Terror (1792â€“1794)</h2>
  <p>As the Revolution intensified, France abolished the monarchy and executed Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. The newly formed Republic faced both internal rebellion and foreign invasion. Radical factions led by Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins imposed strict revolutionary control, resulting in the infamous Reign of Terror.</p>
  <p>Thousands were executed by guillotine, including moderates and revolutionaries alike. Although the Terror aimed to protect the Republic from its enemies, it also revealed the dangers of revolutionary extremism and unchecked power.</p>

  <h2>3. The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte (1795â€“1799)</h2>
  <p>Following the fall of Robespierre, the Directory â€” a five-man executive body â€” ruled France with corruption and inefficiency. Amidst chaos, a brilliant young general from Corsica, Napoleon Bonaparte, rose to prominence through his victories in Italy and Egypt. He gained national fame as both a military hero and a stabilizing force.</p>
  <p>In 1799, Napoleon staged a coup dâ€™Ã©tat, overthrowing the Directory and establishing the Consulate. Declaring himself First Consul, he promised order, efficiency, and reform â€” ending the decade of revolutionary turmoil.</p>

  <h2>4. Napoleonâ€™s Empire and Reforms (1804â€“1815)</h2>
  <p>In 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French, signaling both a continuation and betrayal of revolutionary ideals. He centralized government, reformed education, created the Napoleonic Code (a foundation for modern legal systems), and promoted merit-based advancement.</p>
  <p>However, his ambition led to a series of wars across Europe known as the Napoleonic Wars. By spreading revolutionary ideas through conquest, Napoleon both unified and destabilized the continent. His ultimate defeat at Waterloo in 1815 marked the end of the French Empire and the restoration of the monarchy.</p>

  <h2>5. Legacy of the Revolution and Napoleon</h2>
  <p>The French Revolution and Napoleon reshaped Europeâ€™s political and social landscape. The principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity inspired movements across the world. Monarchies learned that the will of the people could no longer be ignored.</p>
  <p>Napoleonâ€™s legacy remains complex â€” he was both a reformer who modernized Europe and a conqueror whose wars caused immense suffering. Yet, together, the Revolution and the Empire paved the way for the modern era of nation-states and civil rights.</p>
