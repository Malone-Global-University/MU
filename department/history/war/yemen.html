      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Yemen Civil War began in 2014 when Houthi rebels, from the Zaidi Shia minority, seized control of the capital Sana’a and much of northern Yemen.  
        The internationally recognized government fled, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in 2015.  
        The conflict has become a complex proxy war, exacerbating Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.
