Pope refused to annul the marriage.

Henry broke from Rome, declared himself Supreme Head of the Church of England (1534), starting the English Reformation.

Catherine of Aragon – Divorced

Henry’s first wife, widow of his brother Arthur.

Marriage lasted ~24 years, gave birth to Mary I.

Henry divorced her because she didn’t produce a male heir and he wanted to marry Anne Boleyn.

Anne Boleyn – Beheaded

Henry’s second wife, mother of Elizabeth I.

Famous for her intelligence and charm, but political intrigue and accusations of adultery led to her execution.

Jane Seymour – Died

Henry’s third wife, considered his “favorite” because she bore him his long-desired son, Edward VI.

Died shortly after childbirth due to complications.

Anne of Cleves – Divorced

German princess, marriage arranged for political alliance.

Henry claimed he was “not attracted” to her; the marriage was annulled after six months.

Catherine Howard – Beheaded

Henry’s fifth wife, much younger than him.

Executed for committing adultery, a dangerous offense in Henry’s court.

Catherine Parr – Survived

Sixth wife, more of a caretaker and intellectual companion.

Outlived Henry, helped reconcile him with his daughters, and remarried after his death.



1. Catherine of Aragon (1485–1536) – Divorced

Background: Daughter of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile (the famous “Spanish monarchs who funded Columbus”). She was married to Henry’s older brother, Arthur, first.

Life in England: Became queen in 1509 when Henry VIII married her after Arthur’s death. Highly educated, devoutly Catholic, politically astute.

Children: Had several children, but only Mary I survived infancy.

Challenges: Henry wanted a male heir; Catherine’s failure to produce one gave him the “justification” to seek an annulment.

Later Life: Lived quietly in England after the divorce, remained devout, and never accepted Henry’s new wives.

2. Anne Boleyn (c. 1501–1536) – Beheaded

Background: English noblewoman, daughter of Thomas Boleyn, well-educated, politically ambitious, and charismatic.

Rise to Power: Captivated Henry VIII; her refusal to be his mistress led him to break from the Catholic Church (English Reformation) to marry her.

Children: Gave birth to Elizabeth I, future queen, but no surviving sons.

Downfall: Accused of adultery, incest, and treason—likely politically motivated to allow Henry to marry again.

Legacy: Mother of Elizabeth I, whose reign became a golden age in English history.

3. Jane Seymour (c. 1508–1537) – Died

Background: Gentlewoman from a minor noble family; served as lady-in-waiting to Anne Boleyn.

Legacy: Remembered as the queen who finally gave Henry a son, and as the only one of his wives buried beside him.

Background: German princess, daughter of the Duke of Cleves; marriage arranged for political alliance.

Marriage: Henry VIII reportedly found her unattractive and the marriage was never consummated.

Later Life: Known as “the King’s Sister” in England; lived comfortably, never remarried, and maintained friendly relations with Henry’s court.
