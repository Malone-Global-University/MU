  <h2>1. Background and Coronation</h2>
  <p>In 1894, <strong>Nicholas II</strong> ascended the throne as Tsar of Russia. He ruled as an <strong>absolute monarch</strong>, believing his authority was granted by God. His coronation marked the beginning of the end for the Romanov dynasty. Russia at this time was undergoing <strong>rapid industrialization</strong>, especially in factories and cities, yet agriculture remained slow to modernize. Social inequality and widespread poverty made the empire ripe for revolutionary ideas.</p>
  <p>The Russian calendar during Nicholas‚Äôs reign used the <strong>Julian calendar</strong>, which was <strong>13 days behind</strong> the Gregorian calendar used in the West. This explains why the <strong>October Revolution</strong> (Oct. 25, 1917 Julian) is sometimes said to have occurred on <strong>November 7, 1917</strong> Gregorian.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Ideological Background: Marxism and Communism</h2>
  <p><strong>Marxism</strong> and <strong>Communism</strong> gained popularity among the working classes and intellectuals. These ideologies called for the <strong>means of production</strong>‚Äîfactories, farms, and resources‚Äîto be owned collectively by the people. They sought to <strong>abolish social classes</strong>, eliminate kings, priests, and private property, and establish a system where the government managed production and distribution in the name of equality.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the Russian government was increasingly seen as <strong>incompetent</strong>. Industrialization brought poor working conditions, and agricultural reforms lagged. Foreign policy failures would soon expose the empire‚Äôs fragility.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. The Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905)</h2>
  <p>Japan expanded its influence into Korea, but Russia refused to recognize its territorial claims. In 1904, Japan launched a <strong>sneak attack at Port Arthur</strong>‚Äîa Russian naval base leased from China. Russia suffered humiliating defeats at the <strong>Battle of Mukden</strong> and the <strong>Battle of Tsushima</strong>.</p>
  <p>Russia‚Äôs loss shocked the world. <strong>Sergei Witte</strong> led the negotiations, resulting in Russia losing Port Arthur and half of the contested territory. This defeat severely damaged public faith in Nicholas II‚Äôs leadership.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. 1905 Revolution and the Duma</h2>
  <p>In January 1905, <strong>Father Gapon</strong> led a peaceful march through St. Petersburg to deliver a petition to the Tsar. Soldiers opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds‚Äîan event known as <strong>Bloody Sunday</strong>. The massacre triggered riots across the empire.</p>
  <p>Nicholas II reluctantly permitted the creation of a <strong>Duma</strong> (elected assembly), but it had <strong>no real power</strong>. <strong>Pyotr Stolypin</strong> was later appointed Prime Minister and introduced agricultural reforms before being assassinated in 1911. His death left the government directionless once more.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. World War I and the Fall of the Monarchy</h2>
  <p>In 1914, St. Petersburg was renamed <strong>Petrograd</strong> to sound more Russian. When World War I began, Nicholas appointed himself <strong>Commander-in-Chief of the Army</strong> despite military advisors warning against it. Meanwhile, <strong>Empress Alexandra</strong> ran the capital with the assistance of <strong>Grigori Rasputin</strong>.</p>
  <p>Rasputin‚Äôs influence over the royal family, coupled with Russia‚Äôs defeats on the Eastern Front, created the image of a corrupt and incompetent monarchy. Rasputin was assassinated in 1916 (his genitals were infamously preserved in a jar), but it was too late‚ÄîNicholas had lost all credibility.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. The February and October Revolutions (1917)</h2>
  <p>By early 1917, food shortages, war losses, and mutinies caused the <strong>February Revolution</strong>. Nicholas abdicated, ending 300 years of Romanov rule. The <strong>Provisional Government</strong> took control, but it continued the unpopular war effort.</p>
  <p><strong>Vladimir Lenin</strong> returned from exile, promising <strong>‚ÄúPeace, Land, and Bread.‚Äù</strong> When protests broke out, the Provisional Government suppressed them, arresting many Bolsheviks including <strong>Leon Trotsky</strong>. Lenin fled to Finland while <strong>Alexander Kerensky</strong> appointed <strong>Lavr Kornilov</strong> to command the army.</p>
  <p>Kornilov attempted to march on Petrograd but was stopped by Bolshevik resistance. Kerensky, desperate, freed the Bolsheviks to defend the city‚Äîonly for them to turn on him. In <strong>October 1917</strong>, Trotsky led the Red Guards in seizing Petrograd and the <strong>Winter Palace</strong>. The Bolsheviks declared victory.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Lenin‚Äôs Early Decrees and New Policies</h2>
  <p>After seizing power, Lenin enacted three major decrees:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Decree on Peace:</strong> Immediate withdrawal from World War I.</li>
    <li><strong>Decree on Land:</strong> Abolition of private land ownership.</li>
    <li><strong>Decree on Workers‚Äô Rights:</strong> Minimum wage, universal healthcare, and education; women‚Äôs rights expanded.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Lenin recognized Finland‚Äôs independence and promised free elections‚Äîbut when the Bolsheviks lost, he <strong>dissolved the assembly</strong> and established one-party rule.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918)</h2>
  <p>In 1918, Trotsky signed the <strong>Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</strong> with the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria). Russia lost:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>34% of its population</li>
    <li>54% of its industrial land</li>
    <li>89% of its coalfields</li>
    <li>26% of its railways</li>
    <li>And paid 6 billion marks in reparations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Though humiliating, the treaty allowed the Bolsheviks to focus on consolidating power at home.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>9. The Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì1922)</h2>
  <p>The nation plunged into civil war between the <strong>Reds</strong> (Communists, Socialists, and Anarchists) and the <strong>Whites</strong> (Nationalists, Tsarists, Liberals, Conservatives, and Allied supporters). The Allies‚ÄîBritain, France, and the United States‚Äîbacked the Whites to reopen the Eastern Front and halt communism.</p>
  <p>However, the Whites suffered from internal divisions, drunkenness, and brutality. General <strong>Alexander Kolchak</strong> executed thousands, alienating the population. The Reds, under <strong>Trotsky‚Äôs disciplined leadership</strong>, maintained control through <strong>Red Terror</strong> and by holding officers‚Äô families hostage to ensure loyalty. In July 1918, Nicholas II and his family were executed in Yekaterinburg to prevent their rescue.</p>
  <p>The Reds‚Äô superior organization and resources secured victory, and by 1922 the <strong>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)</strong> was established.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>10. Lenin‚Äôs Legacy and the Rise of Stalin</h2>
  <p>Lenin introduced the <strong>New Economic Policy (NEP)</strong>, allowing limited capitalism to rebuild the economy. When he died in 1924, a power struggle erupted between <strong>Leon Trotsky</strong> and <strong>Joseph Stalin</strong>.</p>
  <p>Trotsky promoted ‚Äú<strong>Permanent Revolution</strong>,‚Äù believing communism must spread globally. Stalin advocated ‚Äú<strong>Socialism in One Country</strong>,‚Äù strengthening the USSR before exporting revolution. Stalin prevailed, exiling Trotsky in 1929 and having him assassinated in Mexico in 1940.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>11. Stalin‚Äôs Consolidation and Transformation of Russia</h2>
  <p>Stalin centralized power through purges, censorship, and the secret police (<strong>NKVD</strong>). Millions were imprisoned in <strong>gulags</strong>. He introduced <strong>Five-Year Plans</strong> to industrialize the USSR and launched <strong>Collectivization</strong>, forcing farmers onto state-run farms‚Äîby 1939, 99% of agriculture was collectivized.</p>
  <p>Although brutal, these policies transformed Russia from an impoverished agrarian empire into a modern industrial superpower. The USSR would later play a decisive role in defeating Nazi Germany, though it remained an authoritarian state that replaced one form of oppression with another.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>12. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>From the coronation of Nicholas II in 1894 to the rise of Stalin in the 1930s, Russia underwent one of the most dramatic transformations in world history. The Revolution abolished monarchy, redefined global politics, and set the stage for the ideological battles of the 20th century.</p>
