    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Contemporary history captures the acceleration of innovation, communication, and globalization in the modern world.

    <h3>The Cold War and Global Balance of Power</h3>
    <p>After 1945, the world split into two ideological blocs: the United States and its allies championed democracy and capitalism, while the Soviet Union promoted communism and centralized governance. The Cold War was fought not only through arms races and proxy wars but also through culture, science, and diplomacy. From Berlin to Cuba, Korea to Vietnam, nations navigated a delicate balance of power where the threat of nuclear conflict hung over global politics.</p>
    <p>This era defined the geopolitical order for decades, shaping alliances, fostering technological competition, and inspiring movements for independence in post-colonial states.</p>

    <h3>Information and Digital Revolutions</h3>
    <p>The late 20th century witnessed an explosion of digital innovation. Computers, the internet, and mobile technology transformed communication, commerce, and knowledge. Information no longer traveled slowly via post or print; it could be transmitted instantly across the globe. This revolution altered how people worked, learned, and connected, creating a networked society in which ideas and culture flowed at unprecedented speed.</p>

    <h3>Economic Globalization and Transnational Corporations</h3>
    <p>Global trade and multinational corporations expanded dramatically, linking economies and supply chains across continents. Companies like IBM, Toyota, and Shell became global actors, influencing markets, politics, and daily life. Free trade agreements, economic blocs, and global finance redefined national economies, creating opportunities for wealth and development while also generating debates about inequality and sovereignty.</p>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>Environmentalism and Sustainability Movements</h3>
    <p>Industrial expansion and technological growth brought environmental costs. Pollution, deforestation, and climate change prompted global awareness and activism. From the first Earth Day in 1970 to international climate accords, movements emerged advocating for renewable energy, conservation, and sustainable development. These efforts emphasized that technological and economic progress must be balanced with the planet’s health.</p>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>Modern Social Movements and Cultural Change</h3>
    <p>Contemporary history is also the story of people asserting rights and identity. Civil rights, feminism, LGBTQ+ advocacy, and anti-apartheid struggles reshaped societies. Global youth movements, digital activism, and cultural revolutions challenged old hierarchies and expanded the scope of human rights. Culture, art, and media became vehicles for social transformation, reflecting and influencing the ideals of inclusion, equality, and justice.</p>

    <h3>Legacy and Consequences</h3>
    <p>The post-1945 era forged a world more interconnected than ever before. Technology, trade, and social change accelerated human progress, yet also exposed tensions: economic inequality, environmental crises, and geopolitical instability. Contemporary history demonstrates that innovation and social activism are intertwined, shaping societies and challenging humanity to balance growth with sustainability, freedom with responsibility, and global interdependence with local identity.</p>
