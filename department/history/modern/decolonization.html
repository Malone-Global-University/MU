    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Decolonization defined the mid-20th century, as European empires dissolved and former colonies asserted sovereignty. Nations across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East reclaimed political independence, restructured their economies, and forged new identities. This period reshaped global diplomacy, altered economic hierarchies, and challenged the assumptions of power that had defined the colonial world.</p>

    <h3>Post-War Independence Movements in Africa and Asia</h3>
    <p>After World War II, weakened European powers faced rising nationalist movements in their colonies. India achieved independence in 1947, inspiring struggles across the continent. In Africa, leaders like Kwame Nkrumah and Jomo Kenyatta guided movements that combined diplomacy, protest, and, at times, armed resistance. Each victory represented not only political freedom but also the reclamation of cultural identity and historical agency.</p>

    <h3>Role of Ideology and Cold War Influence</h3>
    <p>The process of decolonization unfolded against the backdrop of the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet Union sought influence over newly independent states, often providing economic aid, military support, or ideological guidance. Nationalists navigated these pressures, sometimes aligning with one superpower or another, and sometimes asserting strict independence, creating a complex web of global alliances and rivalries.</p>

    <h3>Non-Aligned Movement and Global Diplomacy</h3>
    <p>In response to Cold War pressures, leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru of India and Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt promoted the Non-Aligned Movement. This coalition of newly independent nations sought to assert sovereignty, resist foreign domination, and collaborate on issues of development and peace. The movement emphasized diplomacy, mutual respect, and the idea that the postcolonial world could chart its own course.</p>

    <h3>Economic Dependency and Neo-Colonialism</h3>
    <p>Independence did not automatically resolve economic challenges. Many new nations remained reliant on former colonial powers for trade, technology, and capital. Multinational corporations, structural inequalities, and international financial institutions often perpetuated patterns of dependency, leading critics to describe this phenomenon as neo-colonialism. Leaders grappled with balancing modernization with economic autonomy.</p>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>Cultural Identity and Nation-Building</h3>
    <p>Decolonization was also a struggle to define national identity. Languages, religions, and ethnic groups had to be reconciled into cohesive nations. Education, media, and the arts became tools for fostering unity and pride. Governments and communities alike engaged in nation-building, crafting constitutions, symbols, and civic practices that reflected both local heritage and aspirations for modern statehood.</p>

    <h3>Legacy and Consequences</h3>
    <p>Decolonization transformed the international system. Former colonies became independent actors, reshaping global politics, economics, and culture. Yet the legacies of colonialism persisted, from economic inequalities to border disputes and social divisions. The era demonstrated that freedom is both political and structural—requiring not only sovereignty but also sustainable governance, economic opportunity, and cultural affirmation. It laid the foundation for a multipolar world, where formerly colonized nations claimed their place on the global stage.</p>
