    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Political revolutions marked profound shifts in human governance, driven by demands for liberty, equality, and national identity. These movements redefined global political frameworks and inspired generations of reform. From the colonies of North America to the streets of Paris and the plains of Latin America, revolution reshaped the understanding of power, rights, and the role of the citizen.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>The American Revolution and Constitutional Democracy</h3>
    <p>In the mid-18th century, thirteen British colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America challenged imperial authority. Fueled by ideas of natural rights and self-governance, the colonists rejected taxation without representation and sought political independence. After years of war and negotiation, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution emerged, establishing a republic grounded in written law, separation of powers, and the principle that sovereignty rests with the people.</p>
    <p>The American Revolution set a global precedent: a government could be both accountable to its citizens and founded upon universal principles, rather than inherited privilege.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>The French Revolution and Enlightenment Ideals</h3>
    <p>Across the Atlantic, France experienced a revolution that would redefine modern political thought. Economic hardship, rigid social hierarchies, and the ideas of Enlightenment philosophers combined to ignite popular uprising. The storming of the Bastille in 1789 became a symbol of rebellion against tyranny. The Revolution‚Äôs radical phase abolished monarchy, challenged aristocratic privilege, and codified human rights.</p>
    <p>While violence and political turmoil accompanied these changes, the French Revolution demonstrated that abstract ideals‚Äîliberty, equality, fraternity‚Äîcould motivate mass mobilization and reshape governance itself.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>Latin American Independence Movements</h3>
    <p>Inspired by the American and French revolutions, Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America launched their own struggles for independence in the early 19th century. Leaders like Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Jos√© de San Mart√≠n led armies across vast terrains, uniting diverse populations against imperial rule. Through a combination of diplomacy and warfare, colonies declared sovereignty, creating new nations and affirming that revolutionary ideals could transcend continents and cultures.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>The Spread of Nationalism and Liberalism</h3>
    <p>Revolutionary ideas did not remain confined to their places of origin. Across Europe, the 19th century saw the rise of nationalism and liberalism, movements that emphasized self-determination, constitutional government, and individual freedoms. Citizens demanded representation and challenged absolute monarchies. These ideological currents laid the groundwork for unification in Italy and Germany and inspired reforms across the continent, linking political activism to cultural identity.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>Revolutions of 1848 and Their Global Influence</h3>
    <p>In 1848, a wave of revolutions swept Europe, touching France, the German states, the Austrian Empire, and Italy. Citizens demanded civil liberties, economic opportunity, and national unity. While many uprisings were suppressed, the ideas they carried‚Äîliberty, equality, and political participation‚Äîpersisted, influencing later reforms and revolutions worldwide. These events illustrated the enduring power of popular movements to challenge entrenched authority and reshape societies.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="content-section">
    <h3>Legacy and Consequences</h3>
    <p>Political revolutions transformed the concept of governance forever. They demonstrated that power could be contested, that citizens could shape their destinies, and that abstract ideals could become practical policy. Constitutions, rights declarations, and new forms of government spread globally, inspiring further movements for justice, equality, and national self-determination.</p>
    <p>Yet revolutions also carried instability, violence, and unintended consequences. Monarchies fell and rose again, social hierarchies were challenged, and new tensions emerged. Nevertheless, the legacy of these upheavals remains: a modern world where governance is accountable, sovereignty is contested, and liberty is a guiding principle for nations and citizens alike.</p>
