    <h2>Zeus Establishes Order</h2>
    <p>After the defeat of the Titans, Zeus claimed kingship over gods and mortals, reshaping the cosmos with laws, justice, and divine hierarchy.</p>
</section>


    <section>
      <h2>1. Zeus’ Claim to Kingship</h2>
      <p>After the <strong>Titanomachy</strong>, the Olympians stood victorious. As the youngest son and the architect of victory, <strong>Zeus</strong> assumed the throne of the cosmos. His rule marked the transition from chaos and violence to structured order.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>2. The Cosmic Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>Zeus organized the gods into a new hierarchy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zeus</strong>: King of the gods, lord of the sky, wielder of the thunderbolt.</li>
        <li><strong>Hera</strong>: Queen of the gods, goddess of marriage and family.</li>
        <li><strong>Poseidon</strong>: Lord of the seas.</li>
        <li><strong>Hades</strong>: Ruler of the underworld.</li>
        <li><strong>Hestia and Demeter</strong>: Guardians of hearth and harvest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Zeus also welcomed other deities into the Olympian circle, creating a divine council on <strong>Mount Olympus</strong>.</p>

      <h2>3. Establishing Justice</h2>
      <p>Unlike Cronus, who ruled through fear, Zeus ruled through <strong>law (themis)</strong> and <strong>justice (dike)</strong>. He punished hubris and rewarded piety, creating a system where both gods and mortals were subject to divine order.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Challenges to His Rule</h2>
      <p>Zeus’ reign was not uncontested. Several myths recount challenges to his sovereignty:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Gigantomachy</strong>: Battle with the Giants, children of Gaia.</li>
        <li><strong>Typhon</strong>: A monstrous serpent giant who tested Zeus’ power.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebellions of other gods</strong>, such as Hera, Poseidon, and Athena conspiring against him.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In each case, Zeus prevailed, affirming his supremacy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <p>The establishment of Zeus’ rule represents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The triumph of order over chaos.</li>
        <li>The shift from generational conflict to stable governance.</li>
        <li>A model for kingship in the Greek world — combining strength, justice, and divine authority.</li>
      </ul>
