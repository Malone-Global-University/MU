      <h2>1. Background of the War</h2>
      <p>The Trojan War began when <strong>Paris</strong>, prince of Troy, abducted <strong>Helen</strong>, wife of Menelaus of Sparta. Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and Menelaus’ brother, gathered the Greek kings in a massive expedition to recover her, laying siege to Troy for ten years.</p>

      <h2>2. Focus of the Iliad</h2>
      <p>Rather than narrating the entire war, the <em>Iliad</em> centers on a brief period: the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles in the tenth year. Achilles withdraws from battle in anger, bringing near disaster to the Greeks.</p>
