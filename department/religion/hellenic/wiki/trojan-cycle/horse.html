  </section>

    <section>

      <h2>2. Construction of the Horse</h2>
      <p>The Greeks built a massive wooden horse, hollowed to conceal armed warriors inside. They left it at the gates of Troy as an offering to the gods, claiming it symbolized their departure and appeasement.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. The Deception</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Trojans debated whether to bring the horse inside the city, fearing a trap.</li>
        <li>Cassandra, the prophetess, warned of danger, but her warnings were ignored due to her curse of being disbelieved.</li>
        <li>The Trojans brought the horse into the city as a symbol of victory and submission of the Greeks.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. The Greek Attack</h2>
      <p>At night, the Greek warriors hidden inside the horse emerged, opening the city gates for the returning Greek army. Troy was sacked; its defenders were killed or enslaved, and the city was destroyed.</p>
    </section>
