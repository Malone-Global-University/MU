    <h1>Gaia and Uranus</h1>
    <p>The union of Earth and Sky, from which the first divine generations were born.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>1. Gaia: Mother Earth</h2>
      <p><strong>Gaia</strong> (Γαῖα), the Earth, emerged out of Chaos as one of the first primordial beings. She was the fertile ground, foundation, and living body of the world itself. Hesiod describes her as “broad-bosomed,” supporting mountains, sea, and life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Uranus: Father Sky</h2>
      <p>From Gaia arose <strong>Uranus</strong> (Οὐρανός), the starry Sky. He became both her child and her consort, stretching above her as the heavens that covered the earth. Together, they formed the first cosmic union of Earth and Sky.</p>
      <blockquote>
        “And Earth first bore starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side...”  
        — Hesiod, <em>Theogony</em> (lines 126–127)
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Children of Earth and Sky</h2>
      <p>Gaia and Uranus produced the first families of divine beings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Twelve Titans</strong> — including Oceanus, Hyperion, Themis, Mnemosyne, Cronus, and Rhea.</li>
        <li><strong>The Three Cyclopes</strong> — master smiths with a single eye, later forging Zeus’s thunderbolt.</li>
        <li><strong>The Hecatoncheires</strong> — “Hundred-Handed Ones,” monstrous giants with immense strength.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Conflict of Heaven and Earth</h2>
      <p>Uranus hated some of his children, especially the monstrous ones, and imprisoned them deep within Gaia. This caused her terrible pain, as she was forced to carry them within her body. Angered, Gaia plotted with her son <strong>Cronus</strong>, the youngest Titan, to overthrow Uranus.</p>
      <blockquote>
        “Great Heaven came, bringing Night; longing for love he spread himself over Earth. Then his son reached out with his left hand... and quickly cut off his father’s genitals.”  
        — Hesiod, <em>Theogony</em> (lines 176–181, paraphrased)
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. The Blood of Uranus</h2>
      <p>When Cronus castrated Uranus with the sickle Gaia had given him, Uranus’s blood fell upon the earth, giving rise to new beings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Erinyes (Furies)</strong> — spirits of vengeance.</li>
        <li><strong>The Giants</strong> — powerful enemies of the Olympians in later myths.</li>
        <li><strong>The Meliae</strong> — nymphs of the ash tree.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>His severed genitals fell into the sea, and from the foam that formed around them arose <strong>Aphrodite</strong>, goddess of love and beauty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <p>The myth of Gaia and Uranus dramatizes the tension between creation and suppression:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaia</strong> symbolizes the earth’s fertility and creativity.</li>
        <li><strong>Uranus</strong> represents the oppressive sky, restraining his own children.</li>
        <li><strong>Cronus’s rebellion</strong> signals a recurring theme in Greek myth: sons overthrowing fathers, a cycle of succession in divine rule.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
