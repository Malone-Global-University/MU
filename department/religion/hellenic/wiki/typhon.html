    <h2>Typhon and the Gigantomachy</h2>
    <p>After the Titanomachy, new threats arose against the Olympians: the monstrous Typhon and the Giants, who sought to overthrow Zeus and his kin.</p>
  </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Typhon: The Final Monster</h2>
      <p>Typhon was born from <strong>Gaia</strong> and <strong>Tartarus</strong>, a monstrous being with a hundred serpent heads, fire-breathing eyes, and a voice that echoed like many beasts at once. Sent by Gaia to avenge the Titans, Typhon nearly overpowered Zeus.</p>
      <p>In their cosmic battle, Zeus hurled thunderbolts while Typhon struck with storms and flames. Typhon once tore the sinews from Zeus, leaving him powerless until Hermes restored them. Eventually, Zeus buried Typhon beneath <strong>Mount Etna</strong>, where volcanic eruptions were said to be his rage.</p>

      <h2>2. The Gigantomachy</h2>
      <p>Alongside Typhon, Gaia birthed the <strong>Giants</strong>, an army of massive beings, born from Uranus’ blood when he was overthrown. They launched an assault on Olympus in the <em>Gigantomachy</em> (War of the Giants).</p>
      <p>Unlike the Titanomachy, the gods required the aid of a mortal. Prophecy foretold that only with human help could the Olympians triumph. Thus, <strong>Heracles</strong> joined the gods in battle, shooting arrows that helped slay the Giants one by one.</p>

      <h2>3. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Typhon represents the ultimate chaos of untamed nature, the storm and volcano beyond divine control.</li>
        <li>The Gigantomachy symbolizes the struggle between order (Olympians) and rebellion (Giants), often seen as a mythic reflection of civilization vs. barbarism.</li>
        <li>The inclusion of Heracles suggests that humanity, too, has a role in maintaining cosmic balance.</li>
      </ul>
