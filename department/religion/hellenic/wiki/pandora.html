    <h1>Pandora and the Ages of Man</h1>

      <h2>1. The Creation of Pandora</h2>
      <p>As punishment for Prometheus’ theft of fire, <strong>Zeus</strong> commanded the gods to create the first woman. <strong>Hephaestus</strong> shaped her from clay, and each Olympian gave her a gift:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aphrodite</strong> gave beauty.</li>
        <li><strong>Athena</strong> gave skill in crafts.</li>
        <li><strong>Hermes</strong> gave cunning and a deceptive heart.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Her name, <strong>Pandora</strong>, means “All-Gifted.”</p>

      <h2>2. Pandora’s Jar</h2>
      <p>Pandora was presented to <strong>Epimetheus</strong>, Prometheus’ foolish brother, who accepted her despite warnings. She carried a jar (later mistranslated as a “box”), which contained countless evils.</p>
      <p>When Pandora opened the jar, sufferings such as disease, toil, and death escaped into the world. Only <strong>Hope</strong> remained inside when she shut it again.</p>

      <h2>3. The Ages of Man</h2>
      <p>Hesiod describes humanity as living through successive ages, each marked by decline:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Golden Age</strong>: A time of peace and abundance under Cronus; mortals lived like gods without sorrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Silver Age</strong>: Mortals were childlike and impious; Zeus destroyed them for failing to honor the gods.</li>
        <li><strong>Bronze Age</strong>: Fierce warriors consumed by their own violence, perishing in war.</li>
        <li><strong>Heroic Age</strong>: A brief return to nobility, when demigods and heroes lived and fought at Troy and Thebes.</li>
        <li><strong>Iron Age</strong>: The present age of toil, injustice, and suffering, where human life is short and harsh.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pandora</strong> embodies both beauty and peril — a symbol of irresistible temptation.</li>
        <li>The jar represents the unpredictability of human life and the inevitability of suffering.</li>
        <li>The Ages of Man reflect Greek views of decline, contrasting a lost paradise with the struggles of the present.</li>
        <li><strong>Hope</strong> left in the jar suggests that even in hardship, humanity clings to survival and resilience.</li>
      </ul>
