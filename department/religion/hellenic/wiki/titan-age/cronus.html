<section>
    <h2>Cronus and the Golden Age</h2>
    <p>The reign of Cronus and the era of peace, abundance, and justice before the rise of the Olympians.</p>
</section>


    <section>
      <h2>1. Cronus Ascends</h2>
      <p><strong>Cronus</strong>, the youngest Titan, overthrew his father Uranus at Gaia‚Äôs urging, becoming the ruler of the cosmos. He married his sister <strong>Rhea</strong> and governed during a mythical Golden Age.</p>
      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúHe seized the supreme power and ruled over all things, bringing peace and plenty to men and gods alike.‚Äù  
        ‚Äî Hesiod, <em>Theogony</em> (paraphrased)
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. The Golden Age</h2>
      <p>During this era, humans lived in harmony, free from toil, disease, and sorrow. The land was fertile, harvests were plentiful, and people lived long, peaceful lives. Cronus‚Äô rule represented a time of perfect justice and abundance.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No war or crime existed.</li>
        <li>Food was abundant and freely available.</li>
        <li>Mortals aged slowly and peacefully passed away.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. The Prophecy and Cronus‚Äô Fear</h2>
      <p>Like his father before him, Cronus feared that one of his own children would overthrow him. Gaia and Uranus had warned that the youngest son of Cronus would seize his throne. To prevent this, Cronus swallowed each of his children at birth.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hestia</li>
        <li>Demeter</li>
        <li>Hera</li>
        <li>Hades</li>
        <li>Poseidon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rhea, distraught, secretly saved her youngest, <strong>Zeus</strong>, hiding him in Crete until he was old enough to challenge his father.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <p>The myth of Cronus reflects themes of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generational succession: sons overthrow fathers.</li>
        <li>The cyclical nature of time and power (Cronus is associated with time itself).</li>
        <li>The contrast between idealized early life (Golden Age) and the struggles that follow.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
