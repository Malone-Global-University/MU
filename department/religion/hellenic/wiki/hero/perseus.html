    <h2>Perseus and Medusa</h2>
    <p>The story of Perseus, one of Greece’s earliest heroes, and his legendary slaying of the Gorgon Medusa, whose gaze turned men to stone.</p>
  </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Birth of Perseus</h2>
      <p>Perseus was the son of <strong>Zeus</strong> and the mortal princess <strong>Danaë</strong>. King Acrisius of Argos, fearing a prophecy that Danaë’s son would kill him, locked her in a bronze chamber. Zeus visited her in the form of golden rain, and Perseus was conceived. Acrisius cast mother and child into the sea in a chest, but they survived and landed on the island of Seriphos.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. The Quest Assigned</h2>
      <p>The ruler of Seriphos, King <strong>Polydectes</strong>, sought Danaë’s hand and plotted to remove Perseus. He challenged the youth to fetch the head of <strong>Medusa</strong>, one of the three Gorgon sisters. Unlike her immortal sisters, Medusa was mortal — but her gaze turned all who looked upon her into stone.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Divine Aid</h2>
      <p>Perseus received help from the gods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Athena</strong> gave him a polished bronze shield to use as a mirror.</li>
        <li><strong>Hermes</strong> gave him a sword (harpe) and guided him.</li>
        <li>The <strong>nymphs</strong> provided winged sandals, a cap of invisibility, and a special bag (kibisis) to hold Medusa’s head.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. The Slaying of Medusa</h2>
      <p>Using the shield as a mirror to avoid her deadly gaze, Perseus approached Medusa as she slept. With one stroke, he cut off her head. From her blood sprang two beings: <strong>Chrysaor</strong> (a giant) and <strong>Pegasus</strong> (the winged horse).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. The Return Journey</h2>
      <p>On his way back, Perseus turned various enemies to stone using Medusa’s head. Most famously, he rescued the princess <strong>Andromeda</strong>, chained to a rock as sacrifice to a sea monster. Perseus slew the beast and later married her.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Fate of Polydectes and Acrisius</h2>
      <p>Perseus returned to Seriphos and turned Polydectes and his followers to stone with Medusa’s head, saving his mother. Later, fulfilling the prophecy, Perseus accidentally killed his grandfather Acrisius with a discus during athletic games.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Perseus represents the archetypal hero aided by divine gifts.</li>
        <li>Medusa embodies chaos, danger, and the terror of the unknown.</li>
        <li>The myth emphasizes courage, cleverness, and divine favor in overcoming impossible odds.</li>
      </ul>
