      <h2>1. Prometheus the Forethinker</h2>

      <h2>3. The Theft of Fire</h2>
      <p>Though humans lived, they were weak and vulnerable without the knowledge of fire. Zeus withheld this divine gift, fearing mortals would become too powerful. Out of pity, Prometheus stole fire from Olympus, hiding it in a fennel stalk, and delivered it to humanity.</p>
      <p>With fire, mortals learned cooking, crafting, metalwork, and civilization itself.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Zeus’ Anger and Prometheus’ Punishment</h2>
      <p>For defying him, Zeus punished Prometheus with eternal torment. He was chained to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains, where an eagle (the emblem of Zeus) devoured his liver each day, only for it to regrow overnight.</p>
      <p>Prometheus endured this suffering until he was later freed by <strong>Heracles</strong>, the great hero of the Olympian age.</p>
