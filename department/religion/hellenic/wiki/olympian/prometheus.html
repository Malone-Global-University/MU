    <h2>Prometheus and the Creation of Humanity</h2>
    <p>Prometheus, a Titan loyal to Zeus during the Titanomachy, became known as the creator and benefactor of humankind, defying Zeus to bring fire and knowledge to mortals.</p>
</section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Prometheus the Forethinker</h2>
      <p><strong>Prometheus</strong>, whose name means ‚ÄúForethought,‚Äù was the son of the Titan Iapetus. Unlike many of his kin, he sided with Zeus in the war against the Titans. He became a protector and teacher of humankind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. The Shaping of Humanity</h2>
      <p>Prometheus is credited with creating the first humans from clay and water, shaping them in the likeness of the gods. Athena breathed life into them, granting them intelligence and a soul.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. The Theft of Fire</h2>
      <p>Though humans lived, they were weak and vulnerable without the knowledge of fire. Zeus withheld this divine gift, fearing mortals would become too powerful. Out of pity, Prometheus stole fire from Olympus, hiding it in a fennel stalk, and delivered it to humanity.</p>
      <p>With fire, mortals learned cooking, crafting, metalwork, and civilization itself.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Zeus‚Äô Anger and Prometheus‚Äô Punishment</h2>
      <p>For defying him, Zeus punished Prometheus with eternal torment. He was chained to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains, where an eagle (the emblem of Zeus) devoured his liver each day, only for it to regrow overnight.</p>
      <p>Prometheus endured this suffering until he was later freed by <strong>Heracles</strong>, the great hero of the Olympian age.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prometheus represents the human quest for knowledge, progress, and defiance of divine limits.</li>
        <li>His suffering symbolizes the price of innovation and rebellion.</li>
        <li>The myth reflects the tension between divine authority (Zeus) and human advancement (Prometheus).</li>
      </ul>
