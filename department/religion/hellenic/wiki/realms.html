      <h2>Division of Realms: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades</h2>
    <p>After the victory over the Titans, the three brothers — Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades — divided the universe among themselves by lot.</p>
  </header>

    <section>
      <h2>1. The Need for Division</h2>
      <p>With the Titans defeated and Zeus established as king, the cosmos required order. To prevent rivalry and ensure balance, Zeus and his brothers drew lots to determine their realms of rule.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. The Three Realms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zeus</strong>: Drew the <em>sky</em> and became ruler of the heavens, storms, thunder, and lightning.</li>
        <li><strong>Poseidon</strong>: Drew the <em>sea</em> and became lord of oceans, rivers, and earthquakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Hades</strong>: Drew the <em>underworld</em> and became ruler of the realm of the dead, sometimes called Erebus or simply Hades.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The earth itself remained <strong>common ground</strong>, shared by all three brothers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <p>The division of realms illustrates the Greek view of cosmic balance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>sky</strong> represents divine authority and law.</li>
        <li>The <strong>sea</strong> represents movement, change, and unpredictability.</li>
        <li>The <strong>underworld</strong> represents inevitability and the cycle of life and death.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. The Brothers’ Relationship</h2>
      <p>Though united in victory, the brothers’ realms often overlapped in myth:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Poseidon and Athena competed for Athens, showing the tension between gods of sky/sea and mortals.</li>
        <li>Hades, though powerful, remained isolated, reflecting his distant and fearsome role in religion.</li>
        <li>Zeus maintained supreme authority, even over his brothers, though Poseidon sometimes challenged him.</li>
      </ul>
