    <h2>Heracles and the Twelve Labors</h2>
    <p>Heracles, the greatest of Greek heroes, endured twelve impossible labors as penance, achieving immortality through strength, courage, and divine favor.</p>
  </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Birth and Early Life</h2>
      <p>Heracles was the son of <strong>Zeus</strong> and the mortal princess <strong>Alcmene</strong>. Hera, jealous of Zeus’ affair, sought to destroy the child from birth, sending serpents into his cradle — which the infant strangled with ease.</p>

      <h2>2. The Crime and Punishment</h2>
      <p>As a grown man, Hera struck Heracles with madness, causing him to kill his wife <strong>Megara</strong> and their children. In grief, he sought purification at the oracle of Delphi. The oracle commanded him to serve King <strong>Eurystheus</strong> of Tiryns and Mycenae, who imposed twelve labors upon him.</p>

      <h2>3. The Twelve Labors</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The Nemean Lion</strong> — strangled the invulnerable beast and wore its hide as armor.</li>
        <li><strong>The Lernaean Hydra</strong> — slew the multi-headed serpent with Iolaus’ help, cauterizing its heads.</li>
        <li><strong>The Ceryneian Hind</strong> — captured the sacred deer of Artemis unharmed.</li>
        <li><strong>The Erymanthian Boar</strong> — trapped the beast and brought it to Eurystheus alive.</li>
        <li><strong>The Augean Stables</strong> — cleansed the stables of King Augeas by diverting rivers.</li>
        <li><strong>The Stymphalian Birds</strong> — drove away man-eating birds with bronze clappers.</li>
        <li><strong>The Cretan Bull</strong> — captured the bull of Crete, later linked to the Minotaur’s lineage.</li>
        <li><strong>The Mares of Diomedes</strong> — tamed man-eating horses by feeding them their master.</li>
        <li><strong>The Belt of Hippolyta</strong> — obtained the Amazon queen’s girdle, though Hera stirred conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>The Cattle of Geryon</strong> — slew the triple-bodied giant and brought his cattle.</li>
        <li><strong>The Apples of the Hesperides</strong> — retrieved the golden apples with Atlas’ aid.</li>
        <li><strong>Cerberus</strong> — descended into Hades and brought back the three-headed hound.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>4. Beyond the Labors</h2>
      <p>Even after completing the Twelve Labors, Heracles undertook many more adventures, including aiding the gods in battle, wrestling river gods, and sacking Troy long before the Trojan War. His feats spread across the Greek world.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Death and Apotheosis</h2>
      <p>Heracles’ mortal life ended in tragedy. His wife <strong>Deianira</strong>, tricked into thinking a poisoned garment would secure his love, gave it to him — and the poison consumed his flesh. In agony, Heracles built his own funeral pyre. Zeus intervened, raising him to Olympus, where he was granted immortality and wed to <strong>Hebe</strong>, goddess of youth.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The labors represent the triumph of civilization over chaos and wild nature.</li>
        <li>Heracles embodies perseverance through suffering, achieving redemption and glory.</li>
        <li>His eventual apotheosis reflects the hero’s journey from mortal struggle to divine reward.</li>
      </ul>
