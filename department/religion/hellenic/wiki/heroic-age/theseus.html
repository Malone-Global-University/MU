    <h2>Theseus and the Minotaur</h2>
    <p>Theseus, the prince of Athens, became famous for entering the labyrinth of Crete and slaying the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster.</p>
  </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Birth and Early Life</h2>
      <p>Theseus was the son of <strong>Aegeus</strong>, king of Athens, and <strong>Aethra</strong>. Some myths suggest that Poseidon was also his father, giving him divine favor. As a young man, he lifted a heavy stone to retrieve a sword and sandals left by his father, signaling his royal heritage.</p>

      <h2>2. Journey to Athens</h2>
      <p>Rather than traveling by sea, Theseus chose the dangerous land route to Athens, facing and defeating numerous bandits and monsters along the way, such as Periphetes, Sinis, and Sciron. Each victory demonstrated his courage, strength, and cleverness.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>3. The Minotaur and the Labyrinth</h2>
      <p>The island of Crete, ruled by King <strong>Minos</strong>, required Athens to send seven youths and seven maidens every nine years as tribute to feed the Minotaur, a monstrous child of Pasiphaë and a divine bull. Theseus volunteered to end this cycle of sacrifice.</p>
      <p>With the help of <strong>Ariadne</strong>, Minos’ daughter, who gave him a ball of thread to mark his path, Theseus navigated the labyrinth and slew the Minotaur with his bare hands (or sword in some versions).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Return to Athens</h2>
      <p>Theseus and the Athenian youths escaped using Ariadne’s thread. On the return journey, Theseus abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos, where she would later be rescued by Dionysus. In his triumph, Theseus forgot to change the black sails to white as a signal of his success, causing his father Aegeus to leap into the sea in grief, giving the Aegean Sea its name.</p>
