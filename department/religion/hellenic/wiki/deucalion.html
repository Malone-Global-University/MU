    <h2>The Flood of Deucalion</h2>
    <p>The Greek flood myth recounts how Zeus destroyed a corrupt humanity, sparing only Deucalion and Pyrrha, who repopulated the earth in a miraculous way.</p>
</section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. The Wickedness of Men</h2>
      <p>In the <strong>Iron Age</strong>, humans became violent, unjust, and impious. <strong>Zeus</strong>, seeing the corruption of mankind, resolved to wipe them out with a great flood.</p>
      <p>Only two were found worthy: <strong>Deucalion</strong>, the son of Prometheus, and his wife <strong>Pyrrha</strong>, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. The Flood</h2>
      <p>Prometheus, foreseeing the disaster, warned his son. Deucalion built a sturdy chest (ark-like vessel), and he and Pyrrha filled it with provisions.</p>
      <p>Zeus unleashed torrential rains and Poseidon loosed the seas. The waters covered nearly all the earth, destroying the rest of humanity. For nine days and nights the chest drifted until it landed on <strong>Mount Parnassus</strong> (in some versions, Mount Etna or Mount Othrys).</p>

      <h2>3. The Oracle of Themis</h2>
      <p>When the floodwaters receded, Deucalion and Pyrrha offered sacrifices to the gods. They sought guidance from the oracle of <strong>Themis</strong>, asking how to restore humankind.</p>
      <p>The oracle replied cryptically: <em>“Cover your heads and throw the bones of your mother behind you.”</em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. The Birth of a New Race</h2>
      <p>At first, Deucalion and Pyrrha were puzzled. But they understood “mother” to mean <strong>Gaia</strong>, the Earth, and her “bones” to mean stones.</p>
      <p>They cast stones behind them as they walked:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Those thrown by Deucalion became men.</li>
        <li>Those thrown by Pyrrha became women.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus a new race of humans was born, hardier and better suited to endure suffering — descendants of stone.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Symbolic Meaning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The flood myth parallels stories in many cultures (e.g., Noah in Hebrew tradition, Utnapishtim in Mesopotamia).</li>
        <li>Deucalion and Pyrrha symbolize renewal and resilience after catastrophe.</li>
        <li>The stones transforming into humans emphasize human endurance — strong and enduring as rock.</li>
        <li>The story explains the continuity of humanity after divine punishment.</li>
      </ul>
