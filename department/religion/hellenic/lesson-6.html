     <h2>Heroes, Demigods & Ancestral Worship</h2>
      <p class="lede">Hero cults and ancestor-worship formed a vital strand of Greek religious life: honoring local founders, mediating between living and dead, and shaping social memory. This lesson explores who qualified as a hero or demigod, how cults developed around tombs and shrines, the rituals performed, and the archaeological and textual evidence historians use.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="overview">
      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>In ancient Greece the term <em>hero</em> (·º•œÅœâœÇ) often denotes a figure midway between human and divine: famed in myth, sometimes of semi-divine birth, and commemorated through cult practices. Hero cults typically centered on tombs (<em>hero√∂n</em>) or sacred precincts, using offerings, libations, and festivals to secure protection, fertility, or victory for the local community. Ancestral worship (family or civic) overlapped with hero cults but focused more narrowly on kin obligations.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="who-are-heroes">
      <h2 id="who-are-heroes">Who Counts as a Hero or Demigod?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mythic founders & champions:</strong> e.g., Theseus in Athens, Orestes in Argos, Kadmos in Thebes ‚Äî local founders became objects of cult.</li>
        <li><strong>Demigods:</strong> Offspring of a god and a mortal (e.g., Heracles), often honored because of extraordinary deeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomb-centred heroes:</strong> Individuals whose burial places attracted offerings and were treated as loci of power (even if historical identity is uncertain).</li>
        <li><strong>Venerated ancestors:</strong> Lineage figures remembered within families or aristocratic houses.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="practices">
      <h2 id="practices">Cult Practices & Rituals</h2>
      <p>Rituals at hero cult sites often differ from Olympian sacrifices: less about animal-killing and more about libations, votive deposits, and libations poured into the tomb. Some common practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Libation into the earth:</strong> Pouring wine or oil directly onto tombs or into pits rather than burning on an altar (typical for chthonic/underworld-related cults).</li>
        <li><strong>Votive deposits:</strong> Weapons, pottery, figurines, and offerings left at the hero√∂n.</li>
        <li><strong>Feasting / commemoration:</strong> Ritual meals sometimes consumed near the tomb; occasionally, only portions were left for the hero.</li>
        <li><strong>Festivals & athletic commemorations:</strong> Annual rites, games, or processions honoring the hero's memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Oaths & legal invocations:</strong> Heroes invoked in oath-taking and justice as guarantors of truth and civic order.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Because many hero cults are chthonic in character, rituals often included darker or subterranean elements and followed different ritual grammars than Olympian public sacrifices.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="functions">
      <h2 id="functions">Social, Political & Legal Functions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Territorial legitimation:</strong> Heroes often legitimized claims to land ‚Äî shrines marked ancestral territory.</li>
        <li><strong>Civic memory & identity:</strong> Founders and legendary figures provided origin myths that unified citizenry.</li>
        <li><strong>Binding legal force:</strong> Invoking hero names in oaths and curses endowed civic decrees with spiritual weight.</li>
        <li><strong>Social cohesion:</strong> Ritual commemoration and shared feasting reinforced group belonging.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="evidence">
      <h2 id="evidence">Textual & Archaeological Evidence</h2>
      <p>Our picture of hero cults comes from an interplay of sources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Literary:</strong> Homeric epics (mentions of tomb-rites), Pausanias‚Äô travel descriptions, classical historians, and tragic / comic allusions.</li>
        <li><strong>Epigraphic:</strong> Inscriptions erecting dedications, decrees establishing cults, lists of annual offerings.</li>
        <li><strong>Archaeological:</strong> Hero√∂n architecture (tombs or small shrines), votive deposits, faunal remains showing libation practices, grave goods and ritual pits.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="examples">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Excavated hero shrines often contain concentrations of small votives and traces of poured libations rather than the large altars associated with Olympian god cults.</p>
      </div>
