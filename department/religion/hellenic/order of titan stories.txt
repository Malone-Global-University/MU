Greek mythology is not originally told in numbered order (like chapters in a Bible or surahs in the Qur’an). It’s a web of stories that different poets, playwrights, and historians told in slightly different ways. That said, later scholars (and modern educators) usually present them in a loose chronological sequence so the myths make sense:

Common Order Used for Teaching the Myths

Cosmogony (Origins of the Universe)

Chaos, Gaia (Earth), Uranus (Sky), Nyx (Night), etc.

The Titans

Birth of the Titans, Cronus castrating Uranus, rule of the Titans.

Titanomachy (War of Gods)

Cronus vs. Zeus, Olympians vs. Titans.

Rise of the Olympians

Zeus establishes order, division of realms (Zeus: sky, Poseidon: sea, Hades: underworld).

Creation of Humans and the Ages of Man

Prometheus, Pandora, flood of Deucalion.

Heroic Age Stories (semi-mythic history, often overlapping):

Perseus, Heracles, Theseus, Jason & the Argonauts, Trojan War, Odysseus.

Key Thing

No universal numbering system. Hesiod’s Theogony (c. 700 BCE) is the closest thing to a “systematic” ordering.

Later compilers like Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, ~1st–2nd c. CE) tried to organize everything into a semi-chronological handbook.

Modern textbooks often mimic that flow.
