  <h2>Lesson 2: Types of Securities</h2>
<p class="wide">
Now that you understand what securities are, let’s break them down into different types. Broadly, securities are classified into three main categories: equity securities (stocks), debt securities (bonds), and derivatives (options, futures, etc.).

1. Equity Securities (Stocks)
Equity securities represent ownership in a company. When you buy stock, you own a piece of the business and may be entitled to a share of its profits.
Common Stocks – Most stocks fall into this category. Shareholders can vote on company matters and may receive dividends, but they are last in line for assets if the company goes bankrupt. 
Preferred Stocks – These do not have voting rights but typically offer fixed dividends. They have a higher claim on assets than common stocks in bankruptcy. 
Stock Classifications:
Growth Stocks – High potential for capital appreciation but may not pay dividends (e.g., tech stocks like Apple, Tesla). 
Value Stocks – Undervalued stocks that trade below their intrinsic value (e.g., older companies like Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble). 
Dividend Stocks – Companies that consistently pay dividends (e.g., utilities, consumer staples). 
Blue-Chip Stocks – Large, established, financially sound companies (e.g., Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson). 
Small-Cap, Mid-Cap, Large-Cap Stocks – Categorized based on market capitalization. 

2. Debt Securities (Bonds)
Debt securities are essentially loans that investors make to entities (corporations, municipalities, or governments). In return, they receive periodic interest payments and the principal amount at maturity.
Types of Bonds:
Government Bonds – Issued by national governments (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds, municipal bonds). 
Corporate Bonds – Issued by companies. These offer higher returns but come with credit risk. 
Municipal Bonds (Munis) – Issued by state or local governments. They often have tax-free interest income. 
Junk Bonds – High-yield bonds with lower credit ratings, offering higher returns but with higher risk. 
Convertible Bonds – Can be converted into stocks under certain conditions. 
Key Bond Terms:
Coupon Rate – The fixed interest rate paid on the bond. 
Yield to Maturity (YTM) – The total return expected if the bond is held until maturity. 
Credit Rating – Bonds are rated (AAA, AA, A, BBB, etc.) based on their creditworthiness. 

3. Derivatives (Options, Futures, and Swaps)
Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset (such as stocks, bonds, or commodities). These are used for speculation, hedging, or leverage.
Options – Contracts that give the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a set price before expiration.
Call Options – The right to buy at a specified price (bullish). 
Put Options – The right to sell at a specified price (bearish). 
Futures – Contracts that obligate the buyer and seller to trade an asset at a future date and price.
Swaps – Contracts where two parties exchange cash flows (e.g., interest rate swaps, currency swaps).

4. Other Securities
There are additional securities beyond stocks, bonds, and derivatives:
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) – Baskets of stocks or bonds that trade like stocks (e.g., VOO, VUG). 
Mutual Funds – Actively or passively managed portfolios of securities. 
REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) – Securities that allow investors to gain exposure to real estate markets. 
Commodities (Gold, Oil, Silver, etc.) – Can be traded through ETFs or futures contracts.
