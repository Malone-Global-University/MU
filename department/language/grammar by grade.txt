Parts of Speech Lessons by Grade Level
Elementary School (Grades 2–5)
Goal: Recognize and name the basic parts of speech.

Nouns – people, places, things (dog, city, book)

Verbs – action words (run, jump, eat)

Adjectives – describe nouns (red, happy, tall)

Adverbs – describe actions (quickly, slowly)

Pronouns – take the place of nouns (he, she, it)

Prepositions – show position or direction (on, under, to)

Conjunctions – connect words (and, but)

Interjections – show feeling (Wow! Oh no!)

Activity:
Circle the noun, verb, and adjective in this sentence:
The happy dog runs in the yard.

Middle School (Grades 6–8)
Goal: Understand all 8 parts of speech and their categories.

Nouns – common, proper, abstract, concrete

Pronouns – personal, possessive, demonstrative, relative

Verbs – action, linking, helping

Adjectives – describe nouns (What kind? Which one? How many?)

Adverbs – describe verbs/adjectives/adverbs (How? When? Where? To what extent?)

Prepositions – show relationships (in, on, after, between)

Conjunctions – coordinating, subordinating, correlative

Interjections – strong emotion

Activity:
Underline the preposition and circle the conjunction:
I went to the park, but it was raining.

High School (Grades 9–12)
Goal: Apply knowledge of parts of speech to improve writing and analysis.

Nouns & Pronouns: used for clarity, precision, and variety.

Verbs: importance of strong action verbs vs. weak linking verbs.

Adjectives & Adverbs: avoiding overuse to strengthen style.

Prepositions: used in complex phrases; common errors (different from vs. different than).

Conjunctions: creating variety with compound and complex sentences.

Interjections: mostly informal—useful in dialogue but rarely in formal writing.

Advanced Example:
Analyze this sentence:
"Although she was tired, Maria finished her homework and went to bed quickly."

Although – subordinating conjunction

she – pronoun

was – linking verb

tired – adjective

Maria – proper noun

finished, went – action verbs

her – possessive pronoun

homework, bed – nouns

quickly – adverb
