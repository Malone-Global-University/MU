1. Shared Reading (Adult-Led)

Goal: Children hear fluent reading while connecting spoken words to printed text.

Activities:

Adult reads a story aloud daily.

Point at each word as you read so children see the text match the sounds.

Use simple, repetitive texts with familiar words first.

Ask simple questions about the story:

Who is in the story?

What happens first/next?

Gradually introduce new vocabulary words contextually.

Materials:

Short storybooks (1–3 sentences per page at first)

Rhyming and repetitive books (Dr. Seuss, Golden Books)

Your own primers’ short stories can be read aloud in this format.

2. Early Guided Reading

Goal: Children start reading independently while still having adult guidance.

Activities:

Give each child a level-appropriate book (CVC words, sight words, simple sentences).

Encourage children to point to words as they read aloud.

Provide immediate feedback and correction.

Track which words and letter patterns they can read confidently.

Materials:

Level 1 books (Golden Books, Bob Books, or your primers rewritten as small books)

Word cards with pictures for review and reinforcement

3. Independent Practice

Goal: Strengthen fluency and confidence in reading.

Activities:

Children read simple books independently.

Use copying exercises: short sentences from books to practice writing and reading simultaneously.

Have children retell the story in their own words or draw pictures.

Encourage peer reading or reading to adults in small groups.

4. Progression

After your 26-letter primers:

Begin Level 1 Readers – short books using only learned letters/words.

Introduce Simple Sight Words – the, and, is, on, etc.

Move to Slightly Longer Stories – 2–3 sentences per page, repeating known words.

Introduce Blends and Digraphs – once children are comfortable with single letters.

Continue Repetition & Mastery – children move at their own pace; mastery before advancing.

5. Next Steps for Your Series

Create a guided reading section for each primer letter or set of letters.

Design small early readers (like 5–10 pages) that reuse words and letters children know.

Include comprehension activities:

Questions about the story

Picture-to-word matching

Retelling prompts

Develop a progression chart that connects primers → early readers → simple stories → multi-letter blends

If you want, I can draft the first set of early readers based on your 26 primers, including:

5–10 page books

Short sentences

Pictures for each CVC word

Built-in comprehension prompts
