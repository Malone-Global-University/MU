# Hook (1 minute)
Play a 20-second audio clip of an engaging short story excerpt; ask students to name one detail they remember.

# Lesson Overview
**Focus:** Oral storytelling, active listening, and classroom discussion skills.

## Materials
- Story starters or short story excerpts
- Listening checklist for peers
- Timer

## Guided Instruction (8-10 minutes)
1. Model a 1-minute oral story using story-starter prompts.
2. Teach active listening cues (eye contact, nodding, asking one question).

## Practice (8-10 minutes)
- Pair-share: student A tells a 1-minute story, student B completes the listening checklist and asks one follow-up question.

## Independent Practice (5-8 minutes)
- Rotate roles; a few students present to the whole class if time permits.

## Formative Assessment
- Peer checklist + teacher anecdotal notes on clarity and pacing.

## Differentiation
- *Support:* allow a picture prompt or sentence frames.
- *Challenge:* extend to a 2-minute story with a clear sequence (beginning, middle, end).

## Accessibility
- Provide written story-starter list and allow alternative communication methods if needed.
