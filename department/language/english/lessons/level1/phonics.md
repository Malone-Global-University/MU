# Hook (1-2 minutes)
Play a 30-second 'mystery sound' audio or show an image and ask: which sound do you hear at the start?

# Lesson Overview
**Focus:** Letter recognition, phonemic awareness, decoding.

## Materials
- Printable alphabet chart
- Phonics flashcards
- Audio of isolated sounds
- Whiteboard or slides

## Guided Instruction (10 minutes)
1. Model 5 letters and their primary sounds.
2. Demonstrate blending of CVC words (e.g., /c/ + /a/ + /t/ → "cat").
3. Think-aloud: segment and blend phonemes aloud.

## Practice (10 minutes)
- Partner blending with flashcards (teacher circulates).
- Sound matching game (audio → letter).

## Independent Practice (8 minutes)
- Worksheet: circle the picture that matches the spoken word.

## Formative Assessment
- Exit ticket: student reads 5 CVC words aloud to the teacher or records them.

## Differentiation
- *Support:* reduce to 3 letters, use picture cues.
- *Challenge:* introduce simple digraphs (sh, th).

## Reflection (Teacher)
- Notes on pacing, common misconceptions, next lesson targets.

## Accessibility
- Provide audio transcripts, high-contrast printable charts, and tactile letter cards.
