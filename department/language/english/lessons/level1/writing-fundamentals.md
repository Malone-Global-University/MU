# Hook (2 minutes)
Show a striking photo or short prompt and ask: what is happening? Write one sentence to describe it.

# Lesson Overview
**Focus:** Sentence structure, paragraphing, and basic mechanics.

## Materials
- Picture prompts
- Paragraph frame worksheet
- Word bank

## Guided Instruction (15 minutes)
1. Teach topic sentence + supporting sentences + closing sentence.
2. Model building a paragraph from a picture prompt using the paragraph frame.
3. Demonstrate punctuation checks and capitalization rules.

## Practice (10 minutes)
- Guided write: students fill in a paragraph frame with a partner.

## Independent Practice (10 minutes)
- Write a 5-sentence paragraph on a personal experience or the provided picture prompt.

## Formative Assessment
- Use a simple rubric (topic sentence, 3 supporting details, closing sentence, punctuation) to give feedback.

## Differentiation
- *Support:* sentence starters, shorter paragraph expectation.
- *Challenge:* add one compound sentence and descriptive adjectives.

## Accessibility
- Provide typing options, speech-to-text for drafting, and an audio prompt of the picture description.
