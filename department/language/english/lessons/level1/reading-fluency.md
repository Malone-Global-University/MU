# Hook (1-2 minutes)
Show the first sentence of a short, culturally-relevant story and ask learners to predict what happens next.

# Lesson Overview
**Focus:** Improve reading speed and comprehension strategies.

## Materials
- Short story text
- Timer (one-minute fluency checks)
- Comprehension question sheet

## Guided Instruction (10 minutes)
1. Model fluent reading of a paragraph with expression.
2. Teach chunking (phrasing) and using punctuation to guide reading.
3. Demonstrate a think-aloud for a comprehension question.

## Practice (10 minutes)
- Paired repeated reading: students take turns reading the same short passage aloud twice.
- Quick jot: underline words that helped you predict or infer.

## Independent Practice (8 minutes)
- One-minute fluency read and count words correct per minute (WCPM).

## Formative Assessment
- Record WCPM and answer 3 short comprehension questions.

## Differentiation
- *Support:* smaller passages, oral reading with an adult.
- *Challenge:* assign a longer passage or ask for a summary in writing.

## Accessibility
- Offer audio version and large-print text; provide comprehension questions in simple language.
