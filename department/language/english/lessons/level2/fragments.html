      <h1>Run-on Sentences and Fragments</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Run-on sentences and sentence fragments are common grammar errors that affect clarity. Understanding the difference and how to fix them helps students write complete, coherent sentences.
      </p>

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Run-on sentence:</strong> Two or more independent clauses joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions. Example: <em>I went to the store I bought some bread.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Sentence fragment:</strong> An incomplete sentence that lacks a subject, verb, or complete thought. Example: <em>Running down the street.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <h3>Run-on Sentences</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a period to separate independent clauses: <em>I went to the store. I bought some bread.</em></li>
        <li>Use a semicolon for closely related independent clauses: <em>I went to the store; I bought some bread.</em></li>
        <li>Use a comma + coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so): <em>I went to the store, and I bought some bread.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sentence Fragments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure every sentence has at least one subject and one verb.</li>
        <li>Complete thoughts are necessary; check if the sentence answers “what happened?” or “what is being described?”.</li>
        <li>Combine fragments with nearby sentences if appropriate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Run-on:</strong> I love pizza I eat it every week.<br>
        <strong>Corrected:</strong> I love pizza. I eat it every week.<br>
        <strong>Run-on with semicolon:</strong> I love pizza; I eat it every week.<br>
        <strong>Fragment:</strong> Because I was late.<br>
        <strong>Corrected:</strong> I was late because I missed the bus.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Fix the run-on: She studied all night she passed the exam.</li>
        <li>Fix the fragment: Walking to the park.</li>
        <li>Correct the run-on using a comma + conjunction: He likes coffee he doesn’t like tea.</li>
        <li>Identify if it is a fragment or run-on: Went to the store and bought apples.</li>
        <li>Fix the fragment: When the movie ended.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Answers / Explanation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>She studied all night. She passed the exam. <em>or</em> She studied all night; she passed the exam.</li>
        <li>Walking to the park, I saw a dog. <em>or</em> I was walking to the park.</li>
        <li>He likes coffee, but he doesn’t like tea.</li>
        <li>Fragment: "Went to the store and bought apples." needs a subject → "I went to the store and bought apples."</li>
        <li>When the movie ended, we went home.</li>
      </ol>
