      <h1>Ellipsis and Substitution</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Ellipsis and substitution are grammatical tools used to avoid repetition and make sentences concise. They are commonly used in writing and formal speech.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Ellipsis</strong> is the omission of words that are understood from context.<br>
        <strong>Substitution</strong> is the replacement of words or phrases with another word to avoid repetition, often using words like <em>do, so, one, etc.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ellipsis often occurs in parallel structures or repeated actions: <em>She likes coffee, and he likes tea.</em> → <em>She likes coffee, and he tea.</em></li>
        <li>Substitution uses a single word to replace a longer phrase: <em>I don’t want this pen; I want that one.</em></li>
        <li>Ellipsis can follow auxiliary verbs: <em>He can play the guitar, and she can too.</em></li>
        <li>Use ellipsis carefully to maintain clarity and avoid ambiguity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ellipsis: I ordered pizza, and my friend pizza too. (omitting "ordered")</li>
        <li>Ellipsis: She likes swimming, and he running. (omitting "likes")</li>
        <li>Substitution: I don’t like the red shirt; I prefer the blue one. (one = shirt)</li>
        <li>Substitution: He wants to go to the park, and so do I. (so = want to go to the park)</li>
        <li>Ellipsis in questions: Have you finished your homework? Yes, I have. (omitting "finished my homework")</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Use ellipsis: She can play the piano, and he ________ the guitar.</li>
        <li>Use substitution: I don’t like this cake; I want ________.</li>
        <li>Use ellipsis: I like reading books, and she ________ magazines.</li>
        <li>Use substitution: He will help with the cleaning, and so ________.</li>
        <li>Rewrite with ellipsis: I have visited Paris, and I have visited London too.</li>
      </ol>
