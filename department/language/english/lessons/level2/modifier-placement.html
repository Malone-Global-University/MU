      <h1>Modifier Placement and Clarity</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Modifiers are words, phrases, or clauses that provide description. Proper placement ensures clarity, while incorrect placement can confuse or mislead the reader.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>modifier</strong> describes or limits another word or group of words. To maintain clarity, modifiers should be placed next to the word they are intended to describe.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Place adjectives directly before the nouns they modify: <em>The <strong>red</strong> car sped away.</em></li>
        <li>Place adverbs near the verbs, adjectives, or adverbs they modify: <em>She ran <strong>quickly</strong> to school.</em></li>
        <li>Avoid placing modifiers too far from the words they describe; this can create confusion.</li>
        <li>Modifiers at the beginning or end of a sentence should clearly refer to the subject: <em><strong>Excited about the trip</strong>, the children packed their bags.</em></li>
        <li>Use commas for introductory modifiers: <em>After the meeting, she went home.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> The boy <strong>with the blue hat</strong> is my brother.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> The boy is my brother <strong>with the blue hat</strong>.<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> She almost <strong>finished</strong> all her homework.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> She finished almost all her homework. (changes meaning)<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> Hungry and tired, the students left the classroom.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> The students left the classroom, hungry and tired. (less clear who is hungry and tired)
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the misplaced modifier: "She served sandwiches to the children on paper plates."</li>
        <li>Correct the misplaced modifier: "Running quickly improves your health."</li>
        <li>Rewrite to clarify: "The man saw the dog with one eye."</li>
        <li>Choose the correct placement: "He almost drove for six hours every day." / "He drove for almost six hours every day."</li>
        <li>Identify the modifier in this sentence: "Excited about the news, Maria called her friend."</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Answers / Explanation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Misplaced: "on paper plates" – should be after "sandwiches": "She served sandwiches on paper plates to the children."</li>
        <li>Corrected: "Running improves your health quickly." / Or clarify meaning depending on intent.</li>
        <li>"The man with one eye saw the dog."</li>
        <li>"He drove for almost six hours every day." (clarifies duration)</li>
        <li>Modifier: "Excited about the news"</li>
      </ol>
