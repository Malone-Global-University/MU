      <h1>Misplaced and Dangling Modifiers</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Misplaced and dangling modifiers create confusion or unintended meanings. Understanding how to identify and correct them improves clarity in writing.
      </p>

      <h2>Definitions / Explanation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Misplaced Modifier:</strong> A modifier placed too far from the word it describes, causing confusion. <em>Example:</em> "She almost drove her kids to school every day." (Does she almost drive, or does she drive almost every day?)</li>
        <li><strong>Dangling Modifier:</strong> A modifier that does not clearly or logically refer to any word in the sentence. <em>Example:</em> "Running to catch the bus, the backpack fell off my shoulder." (The backpack is not running!)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Place modifiers as close as possible to the word they modify.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the subject being modified is clearly stated in the sentence.</li>
        <li>Rewrite sentences with dangling modifiers so the intended subject performs the action.</li>
        <li>Check for introductory phrases; make sure they refer logically to the subject immediately following them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Misplaced:</strong> I saw a bird walking to school with binoculars.<br>
        <strong>Corrected:</strong> Walking to school, I saw a bird with binoculars.<br><br>
        <strong>Dangling:</strong> While reading the book, the lamp was on the table.<br>
        <strong>Corrected:</strong> While reading the book, I noticed the lamp was on the table.<br><br>
        <strong>Misplaced:</strong> She served sandwiches to the children on paper plates.<br>
        <strong>Corrected:</strong> She served sandwiches on paper plates to the children.<br><br>
        <strong>Dangling:</strong> After finishing the homework, the TV was turned on.<br>
        <strong>Corrected:</strong> After finishing the homework, I turned on the TV.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the misplaced modifier: "He nearly drove his kids to school every day."</li>
        <li>Correct the dangling modifier: "Walking through the park, the flowers were beautiful."</li>
        <li>Rewrite for clarity: "After eating lunch, the homework was done."</li>
        <li>Identify and correct the error: "Flying over the lake, the fish looked tiny."</li>
        <li>Correct the sentence: "While studying for the test, the phone rang loudly."</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Answers / Explanation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Misplaced: "nearly" – should clarify duration: "He drove his kids to school nearly every day."</li>
        <li>Dangling: Subject missing – corrected: "Walking through the park, I noticed the flowers were beautiful."</li>
        <li>After eating lunch, I did the homework.</li>
        <li>Dangling – corrected: "Flying over the lake, I saw the fish looked tiny."</li>
        <li>Dangling – corrected: "While studying for the test, I heard the phone ring loudly."</li>
      </ol>
