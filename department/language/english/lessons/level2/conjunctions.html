      <h1>Conjunctions</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Conjunctions are words that connect words, phrases, or clauses. They help sentences flow smoothly and express relationships between ideas.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>conjunction</strong> is a word used to link words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence. Conjunctions show how different parts of a sentence are related.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Conjunctions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coordinating Conjunctions:</strong> Connect words, phrases, or clauses of equal importance. <em>Example:</em> and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Subordinating Conjunctions:</strong> Connect a dependent clause to an independent clause. <em>Example:</em> because, although, if, when, since, unless.</li>
        <li><strong>Correlative Conjunctions:</strong> Paired conjunctions that work together. <em>Example:</em> either…or, neither…nor, both…and, not only…but also.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Coordinating conjunctions join elements of equal grammatical rank. Use commas before them when joining independent clauses. <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go, but it was raining.</li>
        <li>Subordinating conjunctions introduce dependent clauses. <em>Example:</em> She stayed home because she was sick.</li>
        <li>Correlative conjunctions must be used in pairs. Ensure parallel structure. <em>Example:</em> Both the teacher and the students enjoyed the trip.</li>
        <li>Do not overuse conjunctions; avoid run-on sentences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Coordinating:</strong> I like tea <em>and</em> coffee.<br>
        <strong>Subordinating:</strong> He left early <em>because</em> he was tired.<br>
        <strong>Correlative:</strong> <em>Either</em> you study hard <em>or</em> you will fail.<br>
        <strong>Coordinating with comma:</strong> She wanted to go, <em>but</em> she had no time.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the conjunction: "I wanted to call, but my phone was dead."</li>
        <li>Choose the correct subordinating conjunction: "I stayed home (because / and / or) it was raining."</li>
        <li>Write a sentence using a correlative conjunction.</li>
        <li>Combine these two sentences using a coordinating conjunction: "She likes apples. She likes oranges."</li>
        <li>Identify the type of conjunction in: "Neither the teacher nor the students were late."</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Answers / Explanation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>but</strong> (coordinating conjunction)</li>
        <li><strong>because</strong> (subordinating conjunction)</li>
        <li>Answers will vary. Example: "Both my brother and my sister enjoy swimming."</li>
        <li>Combined: "She likes apples <strong>and</strong> oranges."</li>
        <li><strong>Neither…nor</strong> (correlative conjunction)</li>
      </ol>
