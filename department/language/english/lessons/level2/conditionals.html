      <h1>Conditionals</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Conditionals are sentences that describe situations and their possible outcomes. They often use "if" clauses and are divided into types based on reality or time reference.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Conditionals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero Conditional:</strong> General truths or facts. <em>If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.</em></li>
        <li><strong>First Conditional:</strong> Real future possibilities. <em>If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Second Conditional:</strong> Unreal or hypothetical present/future situations. <em>If I had a million dollars, I would travel the world.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Third Conditional:</strong> Hypothetical past situations. <em>If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Mixed Conditional:</strong> Combines different time references. <em>If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use "if" to introduce the condition and the correct verb tense for the type of conditional.</li>
        <li>The main clause contains the result or consequence.</li>
        <li>Inversion: For formal writing, "should," "were," or "had" can start the if-clause: <em>Should you need help, call me.</em></li>
        <li>Be mindful of real vs. unreal situations; choose tenses accordingly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Zero Conditional: If you mix red and blue, you get purple.</li>
        <li>First Conditional: If I see him, I will tell him the news.</li>
        <li>Second Conditional: If I were rich, I would buy a mansion.</li>
        <li>Third Conditional: If she had left earlier, she would have caught the train.</li>
        <li>Mixed Conditional: If I had learned French, I could work in Paris now.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Fill in the blank (First Conditional): If it ______ (rain) tomorrow, we ______ (stay) indoors.</li>
        <li>Fill in the blank (Second Conditional): If I ______ (be) taller, I ______ (play) basketball.</li>
        <li>Fill in the blank (Third Conditional): If they ______ (study) more, they ______ (pass) the test.</li>
        <li>Identify the type: If you heat ice, it melts.</li>
        <li>Rewrite using inversion: If you need help, call me.</li>
      </ol>
