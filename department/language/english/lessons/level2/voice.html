      <h1>Verb Voice</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Verb voice indicates whether the subject of the sentence performs the action or receives it. Understanding voice helps clarify sentence meaning and emphasis.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Voice</strong> is a grammatical feature that shows the relationship between the action of the verb and the subject of the sentence. The two main voices are <strong>active</strong> and <strong>passive</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Voice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Voice:</strong> The subject performs the action. <em>Example:</em> The chef cooked the meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Passive Voice:</strong> The subject receives the action. <em>Example:</em> The meal was cooked by the chef.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use active voice for clear, direct, and concise sentences.</li>
        <li>Use passive voice to emphasize the action or the receiver rather than the doer.</li>
        <li>Form the passive voice with the correct form of <em>to be</em> + past participle. <em>Example:</em> The letter <strong>was written</strong> by John.</li>
        <li>Check subject-verb agreement when converting between active and passive voice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Active:</strong> The teacher explained the lesson.<br>
        <strong>Passive:</strong> The lesson was explained by the teacher.<br>
        <strong>Active:</strong> The dog chased the ball.<br>
        <strong>Passive:</strong> The ball was chased by the dog.<br>
        <strong>Active:</strong> The students completed the assignment.<br>
        <strong>Passive:</strong> The assignment was completed by the students.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Convert to passive: "The cat caught the mouse."</li>
        <li>Convert to active: "The book was read by the student."</li>
        <li>Identify the voice: "The manager approved the project."</li>
        <li>Identify the voice: "The project was approved by the manager."</li>
        <li>Rewrite in passive voice to emphasize the receiver: "The chef baked a cake."</li>
      </ol>
