        Verb mood expresses the speaker’s attitude toward the action or state of being. Understanding mood helps convey commands, wishes, possibilities, or statements.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Mood</strong> is a grammatical feature that shows the mode or attitude of the verb. The three primary moods in English are <strong>indicative</strong>, <strong>imperative</strong>, and <strong>subjunctive</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Verb Mood</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Indicative Mood:</strong> States facts or asks questions. <em>Example:</em> She is reading a book. / Are you coming?</li>
        <li><strong>Imperative Mood:</strong> Expresses commands, requests, or instructions. <em>Example:</em> Close the door. / Please pass the salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Subjunctive Mood:</strong> Expresses wishes, hypothetical situations, or conditions contrary to fact. <em>Example:</em> I wish I were taller. / If I were you, I would study more.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the indicative mood for statements of fact or questions.</li>
        <li>Use the imperative mood for giving clear commands or requests.</li>
        <li>The subjunctive mood often uses the base form of the verb after “if” or “wish.”</li>
        <li>In the subjunctive, “were” is used for all subjects in hypothetical statements: "If he were here, we would start."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Indicative:</strong> The sun rises in the east.<br>
        <strong>Imperative:</strong> Sit down and listen.<br>
        <strong>Subjunctive:</strong> I suggest that he study harder.<br>
        <strong>Subjunctive (wish):</strong> I wish it were Friday.<br>
        <strong>Subjunctive (condition):</strong> If I were rich, I would travel the world.
