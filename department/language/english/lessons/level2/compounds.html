      <h1>Compound Words</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Compound words are formed when two or more words are combined to create a new word with a unique meaning. Understanding compounds enhances vocabulary and writing skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>compound word</strong> consists of two or more words joined together to act as a single unit. Compounds can be written as closed words, hyphenated words, or open words (written as separate words but understood as one concept).
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Compound Words</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Closed compounds:</strong> Words joined together without spaces. <em>Example:</em> toothpaste, basketball, notebook</li>
        <li><strong>Hyphenated compounds:</strong> Words joined with a hyphen. <em>Example:</em> mother-in-law, well-known, check-in</li>
        <li><strong>Open compounds:</strong> Words written separately but used together as one idea. <em>Example:</em> ice cream, post office, full moon</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use closed compounds when the words form a single idea that is commonly recognized: toothpaste, keyboard.</li>
        <li>Use hyphens to avoid ambiguity or when combining words with prefixes or suffixes: long-term, self-esteem.</li>
        <li>Use open compounds for phrases that function as a single noun but are not yet commonly recognized as a single word: high school, living room.</li>
        <li>Always check a dictionary for proper spelling, especially for words in transition from open to closed forms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Closed:</strong> basketball, notebook, snowman<br>
        <strong>Hyphenated:</strong> mother-in-law, well-known, check-in<br>
        <strong>Open:</strong> ice cream, post office, full moon<br>
        <strong>Multiple examples in sentences:</strong><br>
        - I bought a <strong>notebook</strong> for school.<br>
        - My <strong>mother-in-law</strong> is visiting next week.<br>
        - We went to the <strong>post office</strong> to mail a package.
