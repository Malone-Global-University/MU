      <h1>Parallelism</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Parallelism is the use of consistent grammatical structures within sentences or lists. Maintaining parallel structure improves readability, rhythm, and clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Parallelism</strong> (also called parallel structure) occurs when words, phrases, or clauses are written in the same grammatical form to create balance and clarity in writing.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the same form for items in a list: <em>I like swimming, running, and biking.</em></li>
        <li>Maintain parallelism with correlative conjunctions (either…or, neither…nor, both…and): <em>She will either go to the store or stay home.</em></li>
        <li>Maintain parallel structure in comparisons: <em>He is smarter than she is patient.</em> → Corrected: <em>He is smarter than she is patient.</em></li>
        <li>Maintain verb tense consistency in sentences with multiple verbs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> She likes reading, to swim, and jogging.<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> She likes reading, swimming, and jogging.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> He wanted to run, jump, and was swimming.<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> He wanted to run, jump, and swim.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> The manager said the project is important, urgent, and it must be completed quickly.<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> The manager said the project is important, urgent, and time-sensitive.
      </p>

        <li>Correct the sentence: We need to study, to revise, and we must practice.</li>
        <li>Correct the sentence with correlative conjunction: Either you start working hard or you are failing.</li>
        <li>Correct the sentence: The new policy is clear, concise, and it is effective.</li>
      </ol>

        <li>We need to study, revise, and practice.</li>
        <li>Either you start working hard or you start failing. <em>or better: Either you work hard or you fail.</em></li>
