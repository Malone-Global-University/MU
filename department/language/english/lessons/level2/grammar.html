      <h2 id="nouns">Nouns</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Nouns are the foundation of English sentences. They name people, places, things, ideas, or concepts. Understanding nouns is essential for forming clear and meaningful sentences.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>noun</strong> is a word that identifies a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns can be concrete (something you can see or touch) or abstract (something you cannot touch but can think about).
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Nouns</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Common Nouns:</strong> General names for people, places, or things. <em>Example:</em> city, teacher, book.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Nouns:</strong> Specific names and always capitalized. <em>Example:</em> New York, Mr. Malone, Shakespeare.</li>
        <li><strong>Concrete Nouns:</strong> Things you can experience with your senses. <em>Example:</em> apple, dog, car.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstract Nouns:</strong> Ideas, qualities, or concepts. <em>Example:</em> freedom, love, honesty.</li>
        <li><strong>Collective Nouns:</strong> Names for a group of people, animals, or things. <em>Example:</em> team, flock, bunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Compound Nouns:</strong> Two or more words joined to form a single noun. <em>Example:</em> toothpaste, mother-in-law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nouns can be singular (one) or plural (more than one). <em>Example:</em> dog → dogs, city → cities.</li>
        <li>Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter.</li>
        <li>Some nouns are uncountable and do not have a plural form. <em>Example:</em> information, water.</li>
        <li>Collective nouns can take singular or plural verbs depending on context. <em>Example:</em> The team is winning. / The team are arguing among themselves.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Common Noun:</strong> I read a <em>book</em> yesterday.<br>
        <strong>Proper Noun:</strong> <em>London</em> is beautiful in spring.<br>
        <strong>Abstract Noun:</strong> <em>Happiness</em> is important for a good life.<br>
        <strong>Collective Noun:</strong> A <em>flock</em> of birds flew overhead.<br>
        <strong>Compound Noun:</strong> My <em>toothbrush</em> is in the bathroom.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the noun in the sentence: "The cat slept on the sofa."</li>
        <li>Decide if the noun is common, proper, or abstract: "Freedom is a basic right."</li>
        <li>Change the singular noun to plural: "child"</li>
        <li>Identify the compound noun: "My brother-in-law is visiting tomorrow."</li>
        <li>Write a sentence using a collective noun.</li>
      </ol>

      <summary>Answers / Explanation</summary>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>cat</strong> (common noun)</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom</strong> (abstract noun)</li>
        <li><strong>children</strong></li>
        <li><strong>brother-in-law</strong></li>

      <h2 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Pronouns are words that replace nouns in a sentence. They help avoid repetition and make sentences clearer and smoother.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>pronoun</strong> is a word used in place of a noun or a noun phrase. Pronouns refer back to people, places, things, or ideas already mentioned or easily identified.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Pronouns</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Pronouns:</strong> Refer to specific people or things. <em>Example:</em> I, you, he, she, it, we, they.</li>
        <li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> Show ownership. <em>Example:</em> mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflexive Pronouns:</strong> Refer back to the subject of the sentence. <em>Example:</em> myself, yourself, himself, herself, themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrative Pronouns:</strong> Point to specific things. <em>Example:</em> this, that, these, those.</li>
        <li><strong>Interrogative Pronouns:</strong> Used to ask questions. <em>Example:</em> who, whom, whose, which, what.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Pronouns:</strong> Introduce relative clauses. <em>Example:</em> who, whom, whose, which, that.</li>
        <li><strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Refer to non-specific people or things. <em>Example:</em> someone, anyone, everyone, nothing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pronouns must agree in number and gender with the nouns they replace. <em>Example:</em> Sarah lost <strong>her</strong> book. (not his)</li>
        <li>Reflexive pronouns are used only when the subject and object are the same. <em>Example:</em> I taught myself to play guitar.</li>
        <li>Demonstrative pronouns point out specific nouns, singular or plural. <em>Example:</em> This is my favorite song. / Those are beautiful flowers.</li>
        <li>Relative pronouns connect clauses to nouns. <em>Example:</em> The man <strong>who</strong> called yesterday is my uncle.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal Pronoun:</strong> <em>He</em> went to the store.<br>
        <strong>Possessive Pronoun:</strong> That book is <em>mine</em>.<br>
        <strong>Reflexive Pronoun:</strong> She prepared <em>herself</em> for the exam.<br>
        <strong>Demonstrative Pronoun:</strong> <em>These</em> are delicious cookies.<br>
        <strong>Interrogative Pronoun:</strong> <em>Who</em> is at the door?<br>
        <strong>Relative Pronoun:</strong> The boy <em>who</em> won the race is my cousin.<br>
        <strong>Indefinite Pronoun:</strong> <em>Someone</em> left their bag in the classroom.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the pronoun: "She is reading a book."</li>
        <li>Choose the correct possessive pronoun: "This pen is (mine / me / I)."</li>
        <li>Rewrite with a reflexive pronoun: "I cooked the meal myself."</li>
        <li>Identify the relative pronoun: "The teacher who helped me is kind."</li>
        <li>Write a sentence using an indefinite pronoun.</li>
      </ol>

      <summary>Answers / Explanation</summary>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>She</strong> (personal pronoun)</li>
        <li><strong>mine</strong></li>
        <li>Correct as is: <strong>myself</strong> already used correctly</li>
        <li><strong>who</strong> (relative pronoun)</li>

      <h2 id="verbs">Verbs</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Verbs are action words. They tell what a subject does or what happens to the subject. Mastering verbs is essential for expressing ideas clearly in English.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>verb</strong> is a word that expresses an action, occurrence, or state of being. Every complete sentence must have a verb.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Verbs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Action Verbs:</strong> Show what the subject does. <em>Example:</em> run, write, eat.</li>
        <li><strong>Linking Verbs:</strong> Connect the subject to more information. <em>Example:</em> is, are, was, seem, become.</li>
        <li><strong>Auxiliary (Helping) Verbs:</strong> Help form different tenses, moods, or voices. <em>Example:</em> have, has, do, will, can.</li>
        <li><strong>Modal Verbs:</strong> Express ability, possibility, permission, or obligation. <em>Example:</em> can, may, must, should, might.</li>
        <li><strong>Transitive Verbs:</strong> Require a direct object to complete the meaning. <em>Example:</em> She <em>reads</em> a book.</li>
        <li><strong>Intransitive Verbs:</strong> Do not require a direct object. <em>Example:</em> He <em>runs</em> every morning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Verb Tenses</h2>
      <p>
        Verbs show when an action occurs. The three main tenses are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Present:</strong> She <em>writes</em> a letter.</li>
        <li><strong>Past:</strong> She <em>wrote</em> a letter.</li>
        <li><strong>Future:</strong> She <em>will write</em> a letter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure subject-verb agreement: singular subjects take singular verbs, plural subjects take plural verbs. <em>Example:</em> He <em>runs</em> fast. / They <em>run</em> fast.</li>
        <li>Use auxiliary verbs to form questions and negatives. <em>Example:</em> Do you like pizza? / She has not finished her homework.</li>
        <li>Modal verbs do not change form for different subjects. <em>Example:</em> I can swim. / She can swim.</li>
        <li>Use correct tense for clarity and consistency. Avoid mixing tenses unnecessarily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Action Verb:</strong> I <em>study</em> every day.<br>
        <strong>Linking Verb:</strong> She <em>is</em> a teacher.<br>
        <strong>Auxiliary Verb:</strong> I <em>have finished</em> my homework.<br>
        <strong>Modal Verb:</strong> You <em>must</em> follow the rules.<br>
        <strong>Transitive Verb:</strong> He <em>reads</em> a book.<br>
        <strong>Intransitive Verb:</strong> The baby <em>cries</em> loudly.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the verb(s) in the sentence: "She is reading a novel."</li>
        <li>Decide if the verb is transitive or intransitive: "He kicked the ball."</li>
        <li>Change the verb to past tense: "They play soccer every weekend."</li>
        <li>Write a sentence using a modal verb.</li>
        <li>Identify the linking verb in: "The soup tastes delicious."</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="adjectives">Adjectives</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns or pronouns. They provide more detail, making writing and speech more vivid and precise.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>adjective</strong> is a word that gives more information about a noun or pronoun, such as its quality, quantity, size, color, shape, or other characteristic.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Adjectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Descriptive Adjectives:</strong> Describe quality or characteristic. <em>Example:</em> beautiful, tall, red.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Adjectives:</strong> Describe amount or quantity. <em>Example:</em> some, many, few.</li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrative Adjectives:</strong> Point out specific nouns. <em>Example:</em> this, that, these, those.</li>
        <li><strong>Possessive Adjectives:</strong> Show ownership. <em>Example:</em> my, your, his, her, our, their.</li>
        <li><strong>Interrogative Adjectives:</strong> Used to ask questions about nouns. <em>Example:</em> which, what, whose.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Adjectives:</strong> Formed from proper nouns. <em>Example:</em> American, Shakespearean, Chinese.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjectives usually come before the noun they describe. <em>Example:</em> She wore a <strong>blue</strong> dress.</li>
        <li>Adjectives can follow linking verbs to describe the subject. <em>Example:</em> The sky is <strong>clear</strong>.</li>
        <li>Use comparative and superlative forms to compare nouns. <em>Example:</em> tall → taller → tallest.</li>
        <li>Adjectives do not change for number or gender in English (except possessive adjectives).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>

      <h2 id="adverbs">Adverbs</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They provide more information about how, when, where, or to what extent an action occurs.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>adverb</strong> is a word that describes or gives more detail about a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Adverbs often end in <em>-ly</em>, but not always.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Adverbs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Manner:</strong> Describe how an action occurs. <em>Example:</em> quickly, carefully, loudly.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Time:</strong> Describe when an action occurs. <em>Example:</em> now, yesterday, soon.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Place:</strong> Describe where an action occurs. <em>Example:</em> here, there, everywhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Frequency:</strong> Describe how often an action occurs. <em>Example:</em> always, often, rarely, never.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Degree:</strong> Describe the intensity or extent of an action, adjective, or another adverb. <em>Example:</em> very, quite, almost, too.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adverbs can move within a sentence, but placement can change meaning. <em>Example:</em> She <em>quickly</em> ran home. / She ran home <em>quickly</em>.</li>
        <li>Adverbs that modify adjectives or other adverbs usually come before the word they modify. <em>Example:</em> very tall, extremely carefully.</li>
        <li>Some words can act as adjectives or adverbs depending on context. <em>Example:</em> fast (adj: a fast car / adv: drive fast).</li>
        <li>Many adverbs are formed by adding <em>-ly</em> to adjectives. <em>Example:</em> quick → quickly, happy → happily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Adverb of Manner:</strong> She sang <em>beautifully</em>.<br>
        <strong>Adverb of Time:</strong> I will call you <em>tomorrow</em>.<br>
        <strong>Adverb of Place:</strong> The children played <em>outside</em>.<br>
        <strong>Adverb of Frequency:</strong> He <em>always</em> arrives early.<br>
        <strong>Adverb of Degree:</strong> I am <em>very</em> tired today.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>

      <h2 id="prepositions">Prepositions</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Prepositions are words that show relationships between a noun (or pronoun) and other words in a sentence. They often indicate direction, location, time, or method.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>preposition</strong> is a word placed before a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase to show its relationship to another word in the sentence. The combination of a preposition and its object is called a <strong>prepositional phrase</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Types of Prepositions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Place:</strong> Show location. <em>Example:</em> in, on, under, between, above.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Time:</strong> Indicate when something happens. <em>Example:</em> at, on, in, during, since.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Direction / Movement:</strong> Show movement or direction. <em>Example:</em> to, into, toward, through.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Cause / Reason:</strong> Show cause or reason. <em>Example:</em> because of, due to.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Agent or Instrument:</strong> Show the doer or tool. <em>Example:</em> by, with.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A preposition is always followed by its object (a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase). <em>Example:</em> She is sitting <strong>on the chair</strong>.</li>
        <li>Do not end a sentence with a preposition unless it is natural in casual speech. <em>Example:</em> Correct: "What are you talking about?" / Formal: "About what are you talking?"</li>
        <li>Prepositions are usually fixed; they are often idiomatic with verbs or adjectives. <em>Example:</em> interested in, rely on, good at.</li>
        <li>Prepositional phrases function as adjectives or adverbs in a sentence. <em>Example:</em> The book <strong>on the table</strong> is mine.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Place:</strong> The cat is <em>under</em> the table.<br>
        <strong>Time:</strong> We will meet <em>at</em> 5 PM.<br>
        <strong>Direction:</strong> He walked <em>into</em> the room.<br>
        <strong>Cause / Reason:</strong> The flight was delayed <em>because of</em> the storm.<br>
        <strong>Agent / Instrument:</strong> The book was written <em>by</em> the author. / She cut the paper <em>with</em> scissors.

      <h2 id="conjunctions">Conjunctions</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Conjunctions are words that connect words, phrases, or clauses. They help sentences flow smoothly and express relationships between ideas.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>conjunction</strong> is a word used to link words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence. Conjunctions show how different parts of a sentence are related.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Conjunctions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coordinating Conjunctions:</strong> Connect words, phrases, or clauses of equal importance. <em>Example:</em> and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Subordinating Conjunctions:</strong> Connect a dependent clause to an independent clause. <em>Example:</em> because, although, if, when, since, unless.</li>
        <li><strong>Correlative Conjunctions:</strong> Paired conjunctions that work together. <em>Example:</em> either…or, neither…nor, both…and, not only…but also.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Coordinating conjunctions join elements of equal grammatical rank. Use commas before them when joining independent clauses. <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go, but it was raining.</li>
        <li>Subordinating conjunctions introduce dependent clauses. <em>Example:</em> She stayed home because she was sick.</li>
        <li>Correlative conjunctions must be used in pairs. Ensure parallel structure. <em>Example:</em> Both the teacher and the students enjoyed the trip.</li>
        <li>Do not overuse conjunctions; avoid run-on sentences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Coordinating:</strong> I like tea <em>and</em> coffee.<br>
        <strong>Subordinating:</strong> He left early <em>because</em> he was tired.<br>
        <strong>Correlative:</strong> <em>Either</em> you study hard <em>or</em> you will fail.<br>
        <strong>Coordinating with comma:</strong> She wanted to go, <em>but</em> she had no time.

      <h2 id="sentence-types">Sentence Types</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Understanding sentence types helps writers and speakers convey ideas clearly and vary their writing style. Sentences can be classified by structure or by purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>sentence</strong> is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must contain at least a subject and a predicate (verb). Sentences can be categorized by structure and by function.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Sentences by Purpose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Declarative Sentences:</strong> Make a statement or express an idea. <em>Example:</em> I am studying English.</li>
        <li><strong>Interrogative Sentences:</strong> Ask a question. <em>Example:</em> Are you coming to class?</li>
        <li><strong>Imperative Sentences:</strong> Give a command, request, or instruction. <em>Example:</em> Please close the door.</li>
        <li><strong>Exclamatory Sentences:</strong> Express strong emotion. <em>Example:</em> What a beautiful day!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Types of Sentences by Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Sentences:</strong> Contain one independent clause. <em>Example:</em> She reads every night.</li>
        <li><strong>Compound Sentences:</strong> Contain two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction. <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go, but it was raining.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Sentences:</strong> Contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. <em>Example:</em> I stayed home because I was tired.</li>
        <li><strong>Compound-Complex Sentences:</strong> Contain two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go out, but I stayed home because I was sick.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every sentence must have at least a subject and a verb.</li>
        <li>Use punctuation correctly: periods for declarative, question marks for interrogative, exclamation points for exclamatory, and optionally periods for imperative.</li>
        <li>Vary sentence types to make writing more interesting and avoid monotony.</li>
        <li>Ensure clauses are complete; avoid fragments or run-on sentences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Declarative:</strong> The sun sets in the west.<br>
        <strong>Interrogative:</strong> Where is my notebook?<br>
        <strong>Imperative:</strong> Please pass the salt.<br>
        <strong>Exclamatory:</strong> I can’t believe we won!<br>
        <strong>Simple:</strong> The dog barked loudly.<br>
        <strong>Compound:</strong> I went to the store, and I bought some milk.<br>
        <strong>Complex:</strong> Although it was raining, we went for a walk.<br>
        <strong>Compound-Complex:</strong> I finished my homework, and I watched TV because I needed a break.

      <h2 id="sentence-elements">Sentence Elements</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Understanding sentence elements is essential for constructing clear and grammatically correct sentences. Every sentence is made up of specific components that work together.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Sentence elements</strong> are the essential parts of a sentence, including the subject, predicate, object, complement, and modifiers. Each element has a role in conveying meaning.
      </p>

      <h2>Major Sentence Elements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> The person, place, thing, or idea performing the action or being described. <em>Example:</em> <strong>She</strong> runs every morning.</li>
        <li><strong>Predicate:</strong> The part of the sentence that tells something about the subject; it usually contains a verb. <em>Example:</em> She <strong>runs every morning</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Object:</strong> Receives the action of the verb. <em>Example:</em> He kicked <strong>the ball</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Indirect Object:</strong> To whom or for whom the action is done. <em>Example:</em> She gave <strong>him</strong> a gift.</li>
        <li><strong>Subject Complement:</strong> Renames or describes the subject; follows linking verbs. <em>Example:</em> He is <strong>a teacher</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Object Complement:</strong> Describes or renames the object. <em>Example:</em> They elected him <strong>president</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Words or phrases that describe other elements (adjectives, adverbs, phrases). <em>Example:</em> The <strong>tall</strong> man ran <strong>quickly</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A sentence must have at least a subject and a predicate.</li>
        <li>Objects and complements provide additional information but are not required for all sentences.</li>
        <li>Modifiers should be placed close to the word they describe to avoid confusion.</li>
        <li>Ensure clarity by keeping sentence elements in logical order.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Subject + Predicate:</strong> The dog <em>barked loudly</em>.<br>
        <strong>Subject + Verb + Direct Object:</strong> She <em>reads books</em>.<br>
        <strong>Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object:</strong> He <em>gave me a gift</em>.<br>
        <strong>Subject + Linking Verb + Subject Complement:</strong> The sky <em>is blue</em>.<br>
        <strong>Subject + Verb + Object + Object Complement:</strong> They <em>named the baby Lily</em>.<br>
        <strong>Modifiers:</strong> The <em>small</em> cat ran <em>quickly</em> across the yard.

      <h2 id="clauses">Clauses</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Clauses are groups of words that contain a subject and a predicate. Understanding clauses helps in building complex and clear sentences.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb. Clauses can be independent (standalone) or dependent (cannot stand alone). Dependent clauses usually begin with subordinating conjunctions or relative pronouns.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Clauses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Independent Clause:</strong> Expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence. <em>Example:</em> I enjoy reading.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent (Subordinate) Clause:</strong> Cannot stand alone and depends on an independent clause. <em>Example:</em> because I was tired, which I borrowed from my friend.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Clause:</strong> A type of dependent clause introduced by a relative pronoun (who, whom, whose, which, that) and modifies a noun. <em>Example:</em> The book <em>that you lent me</em> is amazing.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbial Clause:</strong> Acts as an adverb, modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb. <em>Example:</em> I stayed home <em>because it was raining</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Noun Clause:</strong> Acts as a noun in a sentence. <em>Example:</em> <em>What she said</em> surprised everyone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every independent clause can function as a sentence by itself.</li>
        <li>Dependent clauses must be attached to an independent clause to form a complete sentence.</li>
        <li>Use commas correctly with dependent clauses, especially when they come at the beginning of a sentence. <em>Example:</em> Because it was raining, we stayed inside.</li>
        <li>Relative clauses should immediately follow the noun they modify to avoid confusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Independent:</strong> She likes chocolate.<br>
        <strong>Dependent:</strong> Although she was tired, she finished her homework.<br>
        <strong>Relative:</strong> The man <em>who lives next door</em> is a teacher.<br>
        <strong>Adverbial:</strong> I called her <em>after I arrived home</em>.<br>
        <strong>Noun:</strong> <em>What he decided</em> surprised everyone.

      <h2 id="phrases">Phrases</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Phrases are groups of words that act as a single part of speech but do not contain both a subject and a predicate. They add detail and meaning to sentences.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>phrase</strong> is a group of related words that work together as a unit but do not have both a subject and a verb. Phrases function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, or prepositions in a sentence.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Types of Phrases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Noun Phrase:</strong> Acts as a noun. <em>Example:</em> <em>The tall man</em> is my uncle.</li>
        <li><strong>Verb Phrase:</strong> Consists of a main verb and its helping verbs. <em>Example:</em> She <em>has been studying</em> all night.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjective Phrase:</strong> Modifies a noun or pronoun. <em>Example:</em> The car <em>with the red stripes</em> is fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverb Phrase:</strong> Modifies a verb, adjective, or adverb. <em>Example:</em> She ran <em>with great speed</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositional Phrase:</strong> Begins with a preposition and acts as an adjective or adverb. <em>Example:</em> The book <em>on the table</em> is mine.</li>

        <li>Phrases do not contain both a subject and a verb.</li>
        <li>They function as single parts of speech and add information to sentences.</li>
        <li>Modifiers within phrases should be placed close to the words they describe to avoid confusion.</li>
        <li>Prepositional phrases usually provide location, time, direction, or description.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Noun Phrase:</strong> <em>The bright blue sky</em> amazed everyone.<br>

      <h2 id="tenses">Verb Tenses</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Verb tenses indicate the time of an action or state of being. Understanding tenses is essential for clear communication.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>tense</strong> is the form of a verb that expresses when an action occurs: in the past, present, or future. Each tense can have different aspects to show whether an action is completed, ongoing, or habitual.
      </p>

      <h2>Major Tenses and Aspects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Present Simple:</strong> Actions happening now or regularly. <em>Example:</em> I eat breakfast every day.</li>
        <li><strong>Present Continuous:</strong> Actions happening right now. <em>Example:</em> I am eating breakfast.</li>
        <li><strong>Present Perfect:</strong> Actions that occurred at an unspecified time or continue to the present. <em>Example:</em> I have eaten breakfast.</li>
        <li><strong>Past Simple:</strong> Actions completed in the past. <em>Example:</em> I ate breakfast this morning.</li>
        <li><strong>Past Continuous:</strong> Actions ongoing at a specific past time. <em>Example:</em> I was eating breakfast when you called.</li>
        <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Actions completed before another past action. <em>Example:</em> I had eaten breakfast before I left.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Simple:</strong> Actions that will happen. <em>Example:</em> I will eat breakfast tomorrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Continuous:</strong> Actions ongoing at a future time. <em>Example:</em> I will be eating breakfast at 8 a.m.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Perfect:</strong> Actions that will be completed before a certain future time. <em>Example:</em> I will have eaten breakfast by 9 a.m.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Match the tense with the time reference in your sentence.</li>
        <li>Use the correct auxiliary verbs for perfect and continuous aspects (have, has, had, be, will be, etc.).</li>
        <li>Be consistent with tense within a sentence or paragraph unless a change in time is intended.</li>
        <li>For questions and negatives, use the correct auxiliary verbs: "Do you eat…?" / "I have not eaten…"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Present Simple:</strong> She walks to school every day.<br>
        <strong>Present Continuous:</strong> She is walking to school right now.<br>
        <strong>Present Perfect:</strong> She has walked three miles today.<br>
        <strong>Past Simple:</strong> She walked to school yesterday.<br>
        <strong>Past Continuous:</strong> She was walking to school when it started raining.<br>
        <strong>Past Perfect:</strong> She had walked to school before breakfast.<br>
        <strong>Future Simple:</strong> She will walk to school tomorrow.<br>
        <strong>Future Continuous:</strong> She will be walking to school at 8 a.m.<br>
        <strong>Future Perfect:</strong> She will have walked five miles by noon.

      <h2 id="voice">Verb Voice</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Verb voice indicates whether the subject of the sentence performs the action or receives it. Understanding voice helps clarify sentence meaning and emphasis.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Voice</strong> is a grammatical feature that shows the relationship between the action of the verb and the subject of the sentence. The two main voices are <strong>active</strong> and <strong>passive</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Voice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Voice:</strong> The subject performs the action. <em>Example:</em> The chef cooked the meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Passive Voice:</strong> The subject receives the action. <em>Example:</em> The meal was cooked by the chef.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use active voice for clear, direct, and concise sentences.</li>
        <li>Use passive voice to emphasize the action or the receiver rather than the doer.</li>
        <li>Form the passive voice with the correct form of <em>to be</em> + past participle. <em>Example:</em> The letter <strong>was written</strong> by John.</li>
        <li>Check subject-verb agreement when converting between active and passive voice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Active:</strong> The teacher explained the lesson.<br>
        <strong>Passive:</strong> The lesson was explained by the teacher.<br>
        <strong>Active:</strong> The dog chased the ball.<br>
        <strong>Passive:</strong> The ball was chased by the dog.<br>
        <strong>Active:</strong> The students completed the assignment.<br>
        <strong>Passive:</strong> The assignment was completed by the students.

      <h2 id="mood">Verb Mood</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Verb mood expresses the speaker’s attitude toward the action or state of being. Understanding mood helps convey commands, wishes, possibilities, or statements.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Mood</strong> is a grammatical feature that shows the mode or attitude of the verb. The three primary moods in English are <strong>indicative</strong>, <strong>imperative</strong>, and <strong>subjunctive</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Verb Mood</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Indicative Mood:</strong> States facts or asks questions. <em>Example:</em> She is reading a book. / Are you coming?</li>
        <li><strong>Imperative Mood:</strong> Expresses commands, requests, or instructions. <em>Example:</em> Close the door. / Please pass the salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Subjunctive Mood:</strong> Expresses wishes, hypothetical situations, or conditions contrary to fact. <em>Example:</em> I wish I were taller. / If I were you, I would study more.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the indicative mood for statements of fact or questions.</li>
        <li>Use the imperative mood for giving clear commands or requests.</li>
        <li>The subjunctive mood often uses the base form of the verb after “if” or “wish.”</li>
        <li>In the subjunctive, “were” is used for all subjects in hypothetical statements: "If he were here, we would start."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Indicative:</strong> The sun rises in the east.<br>
        <strong>Imperative:</strong> Sit down and listen.<br>
        <strong>Subjunctive:</strong> I suggest that he study harder.<br>
        <strong>Subjunctive (wish):</strong> I wish it were Friday.<br>

      <h2 id="subject-verb-agreement">Subject-Verb Agreement</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Subject-verb agreement ensures that the subject and verb in a sentence match in number (singular or plural). Correct agreement is essential for grammatical accuracy.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Subject-verb agreement</strong> is the rule that a verb must agree with its subject in number and person. Singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A singular subject takes a singular verb: <em>The cat <strong>runs</strong> fast.</em></li>
        <li>A plural subject takes a plural verb: <em>The cats <strong>run</strong> fast.</em></li>
        <li>When subjects are joined by <strong>and</strong>, use a plural verb: <em>Tom and Jerry <strong>are</strong> friends.</em></li>
        <li>When subjects are joined by <strong>or</strong> or <strong>nor</strong>, the verb agrees with the nearer subject: <em>Either the teacher or the students <strong>are</strong> late.</em></li>
        <li>Collective nouns (team, family, group) usually take singular verbs: <em>The team <strong>wins</strong> every match.</em></li>
        <li>Indefinite pronouns (everyone, someone, each) take singular verbs: <em>Everyone <strong>is</strong> invited.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Special Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Amounts and quantities: <em>Ten dollars <strong>is</strong> enough.</em></li>
        <li>Titles of books, movies, or organizations take singular verbs: <em>'The Lord of the Rings' <strong>is</strong> amazing.</em></li>
        <li>Subjects separated by phrases: Ignore intervening words between subject and verb: <em>The bouquet of flowers <strong>smells</strong> nice.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Singular:</strong> The dog <strong>barks</strong> loudly.<br>
        <strong>Plural:</strong> The dogs <strong>bark</strong> loudly.<br>
        <strong>And:</strong> The teacher and the student <strong>are</strong> talking.<br>
        <strong>Or / Nor:</strong> Neither the students nor the teacher <strong>was</strong> late.<br>
        <strong>Collective:</strong> The jury <strong>decides</strong> the verdict.<br>
        <strong>Indefinite Pronoun:</strong> Somebody <strong>has</strong> left a message.

      <h2 id="pronoun-antecedent-agreement">Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Pronoun-antecedent agreement ensures that a pronoun matches its antecedent in number, gender, and person. This is essential for clarity and grammatical correctness.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>antecedent</strong> is the noun or noun phrase a pronoun refers to. <strong>Pronoun-antecedent agreement</strong> means that the pronoun must agree with its antecedent in number (singular or plural), gender (male, female, or neutral), and person (first, second, or third).
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Singular antecedents take singular pronouns: <em>The student forgot <strong>his</strong> book.</em></li>
        <li>Plural antecedents take plural pronouns: <em>The students forgot <strong>their</strong> books.</em></li>
        <li>When the antecedent is indefinite, use singular pronouns: <em>Everyone must submit <strong>his or her</strong> assignment.</em></li>
        <li>Pronouns must agree in gender: <em>Mary loves her dog. He is playful.</em></li>
        <li>Compound antecedents joined by “and” are usually plural: <em>John and Mary forgot <strong>their</strong> tickets.</em></li>
        <li>Compound antecedents joined by “or” or “nor” agree with the nearer antecedent: <em>Neither the teacher nor the students forgot <strong>their</strong> homework.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Singular:</strong> The dog wagged <strong>its</strong> tail.<br>
        <strong>Plural:</strong> The dogs wagged <strong>their</strong> tails.<br>
        <strong>Indefinite Pronoun:</strong> Each of the players must bring <strong>his or her</strong> equipment.<br>
        <strong>Compound (and):</strong> Sarah and Tom brought <strong>their</strong> books.<br>

      <h2 id="modifier-placement">Modifier Placement and Clarity</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Modifiers are words, phrases, or clauses that provide description. Proper placement ensures clarity, while incorrect placement can confuse or mislead the reader.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>modifier</strong> describes or limits another word or group of words. To maintain clarity, modifiers should be placed next to the word they are intended to describe.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Place adjectives directly before the nouns they modify: <em>The <strong>red</strong> car sped away.</em></li>
        <li>Place adverbs near the verbs, adjectives, or adverbs they modify: <em>She ran <strong>quickly</strong> to school.</em></li>
        <li>Avoid placing modifiers too far from the words they describe; this can create confusion.</li>
        <li>Modifiers at the beginning or end of a sentence should clearly refer to the subject: <em><strong>Excited about the trip</strong>, the children packed their bags.</em></li>
        <li>Use commas for introductory modifiers: <em>After the meeting, she went home.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> The boy <strong>with the blue hat</strong> is my brother.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> The boy is my brother <strong>with the blue hat</strong>.<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> She almost <strong>finished</strong> all her homework.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> She finished almost all her homework. (changes meaning)<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> Hungry and tired, the students left the classroom.<br>

      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Misplaced and dangling modifiers create confusion or unintended meanings. Understanding how to identify and correct them improves clarity in writing.
      </p>

      <h2>Definitions / Explanation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Misplaced Modifier:</strong> A modifier placed too far from the word it describes, causing confusion. <em>Example:</em> "She almost drove her kids to school every day." (Does she almost drive, or does she drive almost every day?)</li>
        <li><strong>Dangling Modifier:</strong> A modifier that does not clearly or logically refer to any word in the sentence. <em>Example:</em> "Running to catch the bus, the backpack fell off my shoulder." (The backpack is not running!)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Place modifiers as close as possible to the word they modify.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the subject being modified is clearly stated in the sentence.</li>
        <li>Rewrite sentences with dangling modifiers so the intended subject performs the action.</li>
        <li>Check for introductory phrases; make sure they refer logically to the subject immediately following them.</li>

      <h2 id="affixes">Affixes</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Affixes are elements added to a base word to change its meaning or grammatical function. Understanding affixes helps expand vocabulary and improve word formation skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>affix</strong> is a morpheme added to a word. Affixes include prefixes (at the beginning of a word) and suffixes (at the end of a word). They can change the meaning, tense, part of speech, or grammatical function of the base word.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Affixes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prefix:</strong> Added to the beginning of a word to change meaning. <em>Example:</em> <strong>un</strong> + happy = unhappy</li>
        <li><strong>Suffix:</strong> Added to the end of a word to change meaning or part of speech. <em>Example:</em> teach + <strong>er</strong> = teacher</li>
        <li><strong>Infix:</strong> Rare in English; inserted inside a word, often for emphasis in slang. <em>Example:</em> fan-bloody-tastic</li>
        <li><strong>Circumfix:</strong> Added around a word, more common in other languages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prefixes do not usually change the part of speech of the base word: unkind (adjective), redo (verb).</li>
        <li>Suffixes often change the part of speech: teach (verb) → teacher (noun).</li>
        <li>Be aware of spelling changes when adding affixes: happy → happiness, rely → reliable.</li>
        <li>Some affixes alter meaning in subtle ways; consult dictionaries if unsure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="compounds">Compound Words</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Compound words are formed when two or more words are combined to create a new word with a unique meaning. Understanding compounds enhances vocabulary and writing skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>compound word</strong> consists of two or more words joined together to act as a single unit. Compounds can be written as closed words, hyphenated words, or open words (written as separate words but understood as one concept).
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Compound Words</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Closed compounds:</strong> Words joined together without spaces. <em>Example:</em> toothpaste, basketball, notebook</li>
        <li><strong>Hyphenated compounds:</strong> Words joined with a hyphen. <em>Example:</em> mother-in-law, well-known, check-in</li>
        <li><strong>Open compounds:</strong> Words written separately but used together as one idea. <em>Example:</em> ice cream, post office, full moon</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use closed compounds when the words form a single idea that is commonly recognized: toothpaste, keyboard.</li>
        <li>Use hyphens to avoid ambiguity or when combining words with prefixes or suffixes: long-term, self-esteem.</li>
        <li>Use open compounds for phrases that function as a single noun but are not yet commonly recognized as a single word: high school, living room.</li>
        <li>Always check a dictionary for proper spelling, especially for words in transition from open to closed forms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Closed:</strong> basketball, notebook, snowman<br>
        <strong>Hyphenated:</strong> mother-in-law, well-known, check-in<br>
        <strong>Open:</strong> ice cream, post office, full moon<br>
        <strong>Multiple examples in sentences:</strong><br>
        - I bought a <strong>notebook</strong> for school.<br>
        - My <strong>mother-in-law</strong> is visiting next week.<br>
        - We went to the <strong>post office</strong> to mail a package.

      <h2 id="conversion">Conversion (Zero Derivation)</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Conversion, also called zero derivation, is the process of creating a new word by changing the part of speech of an existing word without adding a suffix or prefix. This helps expand vocabulary and allows flexible use of words in sentences.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Conversion</strong> occurs when a word shifts from one part of speech to another without any morphological change. For example, a noun can become a verb, or an adjective can become a noun.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nouns can become verbs: <em>to email (from the noun "email")</em></li>
        <li>Verbs can become nouns: <em>a run (from the verb "run")</em></li>
        <li>Adjectives can become nouns: <em>the poor (from "poor")</em></li>
        <li>Context usually determines the function of the word: watch (noun: "I bought a watch"; verb: "I watch TV")</li>
        <li>Conversion does not require any spelling changes or affixes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Noun → Verb:</strong> Google (noun) → to google (verb)<br>
        <strong>Verb → Noun:</strong> run (verb) → a run (noun)<br>
        <strong>Adjective → Noun:</strong> poor (adjective) → the poor (noun)<br>
        <strong>Adjective → Verb (less common):</strong> empty → to empty the box<br>
        <strong>Other examples:</strong> bottle (noun) → to bottle (verb), calm (adjective) → to calm (verb)
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the conversion: "I will text you later." (text = noun or verb?)</li>
        <li>Identify the conversion: "The poor need help." (poor = adjective or noun?)</li>
        <li>Convert the noun "hand" into a verb in a sentence.</li>

        <li>Explain the part of speech change in: "We will bottle the juice today."</li>

      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Apostrophes are punctuation marks used to show possession, indicate omitted letters, or form some plural nouns. Proper usage clarifies meaning in writing.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>apostrophe (’)</strong> is a punctuation mark that primarily serves three functions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To show possession</li>
        <li>To indicate omitted letters in contractions</li>
        <li>To form plural of letters, numbers, or symbols (less common)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Possession:</strong> Add ’s to show ownership: <em>Jessica’s book</em> (the book belongs to Jessica).</li>
        <li>For plural nouns ending in s, add only an apostrophe: <em>The dogs’ toys</em> (toys of the dogs).</li>
        <li><strong>Contractions:</strong> Use an apostrophe to replace missing letters: <em>don’t (do not), it’s (it is)</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Plural of letters, numbers, or symbols:</strong> Use apostrophes to avoid confusion: <em>Mind your p’s and q’s, There are two 7’s in the code.</em></li>
        <li>Do not use apostrophes to form regular plurals: <em>Incorrect: apple’s for apples</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Possession:</strong> The teacher’s desk, the children’s playground<br>

        Dashes and hyphens are punctuation marks used to connect, separate, or emphasize words and phrases. Proper usage improves readability and meaning.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hyphen (-)</strong> – Connects words or parts of words, such as in compound words or numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Dash (– or —)</strong> – Separates or emphasizes phrases or clauses; can indicate interruption or range.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Use hyphens in some prefixes and suffixes: <em>ex-president, self-esteem</em></li>
        <li>Avoid unnecessary hyphens: <em>Incorrect: very-well</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Dashes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use an en dash (–) for ranges: <em>pages 10–20, 1990–2000</em></li>
        <li>Use an em dash (—) for emphasis, interruptions, or explanations: <em>He was late—again.</em></li>

      <h2 id="parentheses">Parentheses and Brackets</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Parentheses and brackets are punctuation marks used to add extra information, clarify meaning, or indicate editorial notes. Correct usage improves readability and prevents confusion.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Parentheses ( )</strong> – Enclose additional information, explanations, or afterthoughts in a sentence.</li>
        <li><strong>Brackets [ ]</strong> – Enclose editorial notes, clarifications, or modifications within quoted material, or mathematical content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <h3>Parentheses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use parentheses to provide extra or nonessential information: <em>She moved to Paris (France) last year.</em></li>
        <li>Do not overuse; parentheses interrupt the flow of the sentence.</li>
        <li>Periods go outside parentheses unless the entire sentence is within them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Brackets</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use brackets to add clarification or correction within a quote: <em>"He [the manager] approved the project."</em></li>
        <li>Use brackets in academic writing to indicate editorial additions or notes.</li>
        <li>Use brackets in mathematical expressions: <em>[2 × (3 + 4)] ÷ 5</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Parentheses:</strong> The conference (originally scheduled for June) has been postponed.<br>
        <strong>Entire sentence in parentheses:</strong> (This is an important reminder.)<br>
        <strong>Brackets for clarification:</strong> "She said she was 'excited [about the trip] to start her new job.'"<br>
        <strong>Mathematical brackets:</strong> Calculate [3 × (2 + 5)] ÷ 4.

      <h2 id="negatives">Double Negatives</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Double negatives occur when two negative words are used in the same clause, which can create confusion or reverse the intended meaning. Correcting double negatives ensures clarity in writing and speaking.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>double negative</strong> happens when two negative expressions (e.g., not, no, never, nobody, nothing) appear in the same sentence, often making it grammatically incorrect or changing the meaning.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use only one negative in a clause to express negation clearly: <em>I don’t have any money.</em></li>
        <li>Be careful with informal speech; some dialects use double negatives for emphasis (considered nonstandard in formal writing).</li>
        <li>Avoid combining words like “never” with “nothing,” or “no” with “not” in standard English: <em>Incorrect: I don’t need no help.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> I don’t need no help.<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> I don’t need any help.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> She never said nothing about the problem.<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> She never said anything about the problem.<br>
        <strong>Incorrect:</strong> He can’t hardly wait.<br>
        <strong>Correct:</strong> He can hardly wait.

      <h2 id="fragments">Run-on Sentences and Fragments</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Run-on sentences and sentence fragments are common grammar errors that affect clarity. Understanding the difference and how to fix them helps students write complete, coherent sentences.
      </p>

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Run-on sentence:</strong> Two or more independent clauses joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions. Example: <em>I went to the store I bought some bread.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Sentence fragment:</strong> An incomplete sentence that lacks a subject, verb, or complete thought. Example: <em>Running down the street.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <h3>Run-on Sentences</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a period to separate independent clauses: <em>I went to the store. I bought some bread.</em></li>
        <li>Use a semicolon for closely related independent clauses: <em>I went to the store; I bought some bread.</em></li>
        <li>Use a comma + coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so): <em>I went to the store, and I bought some bread.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sentence Fragments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure every sentence has at least one subject and one verb.</li>
        <li>Complete thoughts are necessary; check if the sentence answers “what happened?” or “what is being described?”.</li>
        <li>Combine fragments with nearby sentences if appropriate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Run-on:</strong> I love pizza I eat it every week.<br>
        <strong>Corrected:</strong> I love pizza. I eat it every week.<br>
        <strong>Run-on with semicolon:</strong> I love pizza; I eat it every week.<br>
        <strong>Fragment:</strong> Because I was late.<br>
        <strong>Corrected:</strong> I was late because I missed the bus.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Fix the run-on: She studied all night she passed the exam.</li>

        <li>Fix the fragment: When the movie ended.</li>
      </ol>

    <details><summary>Answers / Explanation</summary>

      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Parallelism is the use of consistent grammatical structures within sentences or lists. Maintaining parallel structure improves readability, rhythm, and clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Parallelism</strong> (also called parallel structure) occurs when words, phrases, or clauses are written in the same grammatical form to create balance and clarity in writing.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the same form for items in a list: <em>I like swimming, running, and biking.</em></li>
        <li>Maintain parallelism with correlative conjunctions (either…or, neither…nor, both…and): <em>She will either go to the store or stay home.</em></li>
        <li>Maintain parallel structure in comparisons: <em>He is smarter than she is patient.</em> → Corrected: <em>He is smarter than she is patient.</em></li>
        <li>Maintain verb tense consistency in sentences with multiple verbs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>

      <h2 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Conditionals are sentences that describe situations and their possible outcomes. They often use "if" clauses and are divided into types based on reality or time reference.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Conditionals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero Conditional:</strong> General truths or facts. <em>If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.</em></li>
        <li><strong>First Conditional:</strong> Real future possibilities. <em>If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Second Conditional:</strong> Unreal or hypothetical present/future situations. <em>If I had a million dollars, I would travel the world.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Third Conditional:</strong> Hypothetical past situations. <em>If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Mixed Conditional:</strong> Combines different time references. <em>If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use "if" to introduce the condition and the correct verb tense for the type of conditional.</li>
        <li>The main clause contains the result or consequence.</li>
        <li>Inversion: For formal writing, "should," "were," or "had" can start the if-clause: <em>Should you need help, call me.</em></li>
        <li>Be mindful of real vs. unreal situations; choose tenses accordingly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Zero Conditional: If you mix red and blue, you get purple.</li>

      <h2 id="relative-clauses">Relative Clauses</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Relative clauses provide additional information about a noun or pronoun in a sentence. They often begin with relative pronouns such as <em>who, whom, whose, which,</em> or <em>that</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>relative clause</strong> is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun or pronoun. Relative clauses can be essential (defining) or non-essential (non-defining).
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>who</strong> for people and <strong>which</strong> for things.</li>
        <li><strong>That</strong> can be used for people or things in defining clauses.</li>
        <li>Use commas for non-defining clauses: <em>My brother, who lives in Paris, is visiting.</em></li>
        <li>Omit the relative pronoun if it is the object of the clause: <em>The book I read was excellent.</em></li>
        <li>Do not confuse defining vs. non-defining clauses; they affect meaning and punctuation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Defining clause: The man <strong>who called yesterday</strong> is my uncle.</li>
        <li>Non-defining clause: Paris, <strong>which is the capital of France</strong>, is beautiful.</li>
        <li>Omitted pronoun: The movie <strong>I watched</strong> was thrilling.</li>
        <li>Using <strong>whose</strong>: She is the student <strong>whose laptop was stolen</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="reported-speech">Reported Speech</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Reported speech (also called indirect speech) is used to report what someone else has said without quoting them directly. It often requires changes in tense, pronouns, and time expressions.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Reported speech</strong> conveys the content of a spoken statement without using the exact words of the speaker. It usually follows a reporting verb like <em>say, tell, ask</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Shift the tense back when reporting past statements: <em>“I am tired” → He said he was tired.</em></li>
        <li>Change pronouns to match the new subject: <em>“I love this book” → She said she loved that book.</em></li>
        <li>Adjust time expressions: <em>today → that day, tomorrow → the next day</em>.</li>
        <li>Questions: Use "if" or "whether" for yes/no questions: <em>“Are you coming?” → He asked if I was coming.</em></li>
        <li>Commands: Use verbs like <em>tell, ask, order</em> + infinitive: <em>“Close the door!” → She told me to close the door.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct: “I am hungry.” → Reported: He said he was hungry.</li>
        <li>Direct: “We will meet tomorrow.” → Reported: They said they would meet the next day.</li>
        <li>Direct: “Do you like pizza?” → Reported: He asked if I liked pizza.</li>
        <li>Direct: “Please help me.” → Reported: She asked me to help her.</li>
        <li>Direct: “I have finished my homework.” → Reported: He said he had finished his homework.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="inversion">Inversion</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Inversion occurs when the normal word order of a sentence (subject + verb) is reversed, usually for emphasis, formality, or in conditional sentences. It is common in advanced English grammar.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Inversion</strong> is the reversal of the normal word order in a sentence, often placing the verb or auxiliary verb before the subject. It can occur for emphasis, stylistic effect, or in conditional structures.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use inversion after negative adverbials at the beginning: <em>Never have I seen such a view.</em></li>
        <li>In conditional sentences without “if”: <em>Had I known, I would have called.</em></li>
        <li>Use inversion in questions: <em>Are you coming?</em></li>
        <li>Use inversion with “so” + adjective/adverb: <em>So beautiful was the sunset that we stayed longer.</em></li>
        <li>Inversion is optional for emphasis but formalizes the sentence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Negative adverbial inversion: <em>Rarely have I eaten such delicious food.</em></li>
        <li>Conditional inversion: <em>Had I arrived earlier, I would have met her.</em></li>
        <li>Question inversion: <em>Did you see the show?</em></li>
        <li>So / Such inversion: <em>So loud was the music that I could not sleep.</em></li>
        <li>Not only inversion: <em>Not only did he win the race, but he also broke the record.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Rewrite with inversion: “I have never seen such a beautiful painting.”</li>
        <li>Rewrite with inversion: “If I had known, I would have helped.”</li>
        <li>Question inversion: Form a question from “You are ready.”</li>
        <li>Rewrite with so inversion: “The view was so amazing that we stayed for hours.”</li>
        <li>Rewrite with not only inversion: “He not only passed the exam, but he also got the highest score.”</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="ellipsis">Ellipsis and Substitution</h2>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Ellipsis and substitution are grammatical tools used to avoid repetition and make sentences concise. They are commonly used in writing and formal speech.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Ellipsis</strong> is the omission of words that are understood from context.<br>
        <strong>Substitution</strong> is the replacement of words or phrases with another word to avoid repetition, often using words like <em>do, so, one, etc.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ellipsis often occurs in parallel structures or repeated actions: <em>She likes coffee, and he likes tea.</em> → <em>She likes coffee, and he tea.</em></li>
        <li>Substitution uses a single word to replace a longer phrase: <em>I don’t want this pen; I want that one.</em></li>
        <li>Ellipsis can follow auxiliary verbs: <em>He can play the guitar, and she can too.</em></li>
        <li>Use ellipsis carefully to maintain clarity and avoid ambiguity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ellipsis: I ordered pizza, and my friend pizza too. (omitting "ordered")</li>
        <li>Ellipsis: She likes swimming, and he running. (omitting "likes")</li>
        <li>Substitution: I don’t like the red shirt; I prefer the blue one. (one = shirt)</li>
        <li>Substitution: He wants to go to the park, and so do I. (so = want to go to the park)</li>
        <li>Ellipsis in questions: Have you finished your homework? Yes, I have. (omitting "finished my homework")</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Use ellipsis: She can play the piano, and he ________ the guitar.</li>
        <li>Use substitution: I don’t like this cake; I want ________.</li>
        <li>Use ellipsis: I like reading books, and she ________ magazines.</li>
        <li>Use substitution: He will help with the cleaning, and so ________.</li>
        <li>Rewrite with ellipsis: I have visited Paris, and I have visited London too.</li>
