      <h1>Prepositions</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Prepositions are words that show relationships between a noun (or pronoun) and other words in a sentence. They often indicate direction, location, time, or method.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>preposition</strong> is a word placed before a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase to show its relationship to another word in the sentence. The combination of a preposition and its object is called a <strong>prepositional phrase</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Types of Prepositions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Place:</strong> Show location. <em>Example:</em> in, on, under, between, above.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Time:</strong> Indicate when something happens. <em>Example:</em> at, on, in, during, since.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Direction / Movement:</strong> Show movement or direction. <em>Example:</em> to, into, toward, through.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Cause / Reason:</strong> Show cause or reason. <em>Example:</em> because of, due to.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepositions of Agent or Instrument:</strong> Show the doer or tool. <em>Example:</em> by, with.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A preposition is always followed by its object (a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase). <em>Example:</em> She is sitting <strong>on the chair</strong>.</li>
        <li>Do not end a sentence with a preposition unless it is natural in casual speech. <em>Example:</em> Correct: "What are you talking about?" / Formal: "About what are you talking?"</li>
        <li>Prepositions are usually fixed; they are often idiomatic with verbs or adjectives. <em>Example:</em> interested in, rely on, good at.</li>
        <li>Prepositional phrases function as adjectives or adverbs in a sentence. <em>Example:</em> The book <strong>on the table</strong> is mine.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Place:</strong> The cat is <em>under</em> the table.<br>
        <strong>Time:</strong> We will meet <em>at</em> 5 PM.<br>
        <strong>Direction:</strong> He walked <em>into</em> the room.<br>
        <strong>Cause / Reason:</strong> The flight was delayed <em>because of</em> the storm.<br>
        <strong>Agent / Instrument:</strong> The book was written <em>by</em> the author. / She cut the paper <em>with</em> scissors.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
