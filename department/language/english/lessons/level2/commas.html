        Commas are used to indicate pauses, separate ideas, and clarify meaning in a sentence. Correct usage prevents confusion and ensures smooth reading.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>comma (,)</strong> is a punctuation mark that separates elements within a sentence, such as items in a list, clauses, or introductory phrases.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use commas to separate items in a series: <em>Apples, oranges, and bananas.</em></li>
        <li>Use commas before coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) joining independent clauses: <em>I wanted to go, but it started raining.</em></li>
        <li>Use commas after introductory words, phrases, or clauses: <em>After the meeting, we went out for lunch.</em></li>
        <li>Use commas to set off nonessential information: <em>My brother, who lives in New York, is visiting.</em></li>
        <li>Use commas with direct addresses, dates, and numbers: <em>Lisa, can you help me?; July 4, 2025; 1,000</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Series:</strong> I bought pens, pencils, and erasers.<br>
        <strong>Independent Clauses:</strong> She was tired, but she finished her homework.<br>
        <strong>Introductory Phrase:</strong> In the morning, I like to drink coffee.<br>
        <strong>Nonessential Information:</strong> My car, which is red, is parked outside.<br>
        <strong>Direct Address / Dates / Numbers:</strong> John, please come here. / July 4, 2025 / 3,456
      </p>
