      <h1>Verb Tenses</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Verb tenses indicate the time of an action or state of being. Understanding tenses is essential for clear communication.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>tense</strong> is the form of a verb that expresses when an action occurs: in the past, present, or future. Each tense can have different aspects to show whether an action is completed, ongoing, or habitual.
      </p>

      <h2>Major Tenses and Aspects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Present Simple:</strong> Actions happening now or regularly. <em>Example:</em> I eat breakfast every day.</li>
        <li><strong>Present Continuous:</strong> Actions happening right now. <em>Example:</em> I am eating breakfast.</li>
        <li><strong>Present Perfect:</strong> Actions that occurred at an unspecified time or continue to the present. <em>Example:</em> I have eaten breakfast.</li>
        <li><strong>Past Simple:</strong> Actions completed in the past. <em>Example:</em> I ate breakfast this morning.</li>
        <li><strong>Past Continuous:</strong> Actions ongoing at a specific past time. <em>Example:</em> I was eating breakfast when you called.</li>
        <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Actions completed before another past action. <em>Example:</em> I had eaten breakfast before I left.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Simple:</strong> Actions that will happen. <em>Example:</em> I will eat breakfast tomorrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Continuous:</strong> Actions ongoing at a future time. <em>Example:</em> I will be eating breakfast at 8 a.m.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Perfect:</strong> Actions that will be completed before a certain future time. <em>Example:</em> I will have eaten breakfast by 9 a.m.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Match the tense with the time reference in your sentence.</li>
        <li>Use the correct auxiliary verbs for perfect and continuous aspects (have, has, had, be, will be, etc.).</li>
        <li>Be consistent with tense within a sentence or paragraph unless a change in time is intended.</li>
        <li>For questions and negatives, use the correct auxiliary verbs: "Do you eat…?" / "I have not eaten…"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Present Simple:</strong> She walks to school every day.<br>
        <strong>Present Continuous:</strong> She is walking to school right now.<br>
        <strong>Present Perfect:</strong> She has walked three miles today.<br>
        <strong>Past Simple:</strong> She walked to school yesterday.<br>
        <strong>Past Continuous:</strong> She was walking to school when it started raining.<br>
        <strong>Past Perfect:</strong> She had walked to school before breakfast.<br>
        <strong>Future Simple:</strong> She will walk to school tomorrow.<br>
        <strong>Future Continuous:</strong> She will be walking to school at 8 a.m.<br>
        <strong>Future Perfect:</strong> She will have walked five miles by noon.
      </p>
