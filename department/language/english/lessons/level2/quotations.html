      <h1>Quotation Marks</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Quotation marks are used to enclose direct speech, quotations, titles of short works, or to indicate special terms. Correct usage helps readers understand exactly what is being quoted or emphasized.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Quotation marks (“ ”)</strong> are punctuation marks used primarily to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enclose direct speech or dialogue.</li>
        <li>Enclose titles of short works, like articles, poems, or songs.</li>
        <li>Indicate a word or phrase being discussed or used unusually.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Place commas and periods inside quotation marks in American English: <em>He said, "Hello."</em></li>
        <li>Place question marks and exclamation points inside or outside depending on context: <em>"Are you coming?" she asked.</em> vs <em>Did she just say, "I am leaving"?</em></li>
        <li>Use single quotation marks (‘ ’) for quotes within quotes: <em>"I heard him say, 'I am busy,'" she recalled.</em></li>
        <li>Capitalize the first word of a complete sentence in a quotation.</li>
        <li>Do not use quotation marks for indirect speech: <em>He said he was tired.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct Speech:</strong> "I will be there soon," John said.<br>
        <strong>Quotation within a quotation:</strong> "Did you hear her say, 'I can't believe it'?"<br>
        <strong>Titles of short works:</strong> I just read the poem "The Road Not Taken."<br>
        <strong>Special term:</strong> The word "selfie" became popular in 2015.<br>
        <strong>Question mark outside quotation:</strong> Did she really say, "I am leaving"?
      </p>
