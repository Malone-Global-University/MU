      <h1>Reported Speech</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Reported speech (also called indirect speech) is used to report what someone else has said without quoting them directly. It often requires changes in tense, pronouns, and time expressions.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Reported speech</strong> conveys the content of a spoken statement without using the exact words of the speaker. It usually follows a reporting verb like <em>say, tell, ask</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Shift the tense back when reporting past statements: <em>“I am tired” → He said he was tired.</em></li>
        <li>Change pronouns to match the new subject: <em>“I love this book” → She said she loved that book.</em></li>
        <li>Adjust time expressions: <em>today → that day, tomorrow → the next day</em>.</li>
        <li>Questions: Use "if" or "whether" for yes/no questions: <em>“Are you coming?” → He asked if I was coming.</em></li>
        <li>Commands: Use verbs like <em>tell, ask, order</em> + infinitive: <em>“Close the door!” → She told me to close the door.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct: “I am hungry.” → Reported: He said he was hungry.</li>
        <li>Direct: “We will meet tomorrow.” → Reported: They said they would meet the next day.</li>
        <li>Direct: “Do you like pizza?” → Reported: He asked if I liked pizza.</li>
        <li>Direct: “Please help me.” → Reported: She asked me to help her.</li>
        <li>Direct: “I have finished my homework.” → Reported: He said he had finished his homework.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Change to reported speech: “I can’t find my keys.”</li>
        <li>Change to reported speech: “We are leaving tomorrow.”</li>
        <li>Change to reported speech: “Did you see the movie?”</li>
        <li>Change to reported speech: “Please sit down.”</li>
        <li>Change to reported speech: “I have never been to Paris.”</li>
      </ol>
