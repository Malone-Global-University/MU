      <h1>Sentence Types</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Understanding sentence types helps writers and speakers convey ideas clearly and vary their writing style. Sentences can be classified by structure or by purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>sentence</strong> is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must contain at least a subject and a predicate (verb). Sentences can be categorized by structure and by function.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Sentences by Purpose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Declarative Sentences:</strong> Make a statement or express an idea. <em>Example:</em> I am studying English.</li>
        <li><strong>Interrogative Sentences:</strong> Ask a question. <em>Example:</em> Are you coming to class?</li>
        <li><strong>Imperative Sentences:</strong> Give a command, request, or instruction. <em>Example:</em> Please close the door.</li>
        <li><strong>Exclamatory Sentences:</strong> Express strong emotion. <em>Example:</em> What a beautiful day!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Types of Sentences by Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Sentences:</strong> Contain one independent clause. <em>Example:</em> She reads every night.</li>
        <li><strong>Compound Sentences:</strong> Contain two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction. <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go, but it was raining.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Sentences:</strong> Contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. <em>Example:</em> I stayed home because I was tired.</li>
        <li><strong>Compound-Complex Sentences:</strong> Contain two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. <em>Example:</em> I wanted to go out, but I stayed home because I was sick.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every sentence must have at least a subject and a verb.</li>
        <li>Use punctuation correctly: periods for declarative, question marks for interrogative, exclamation points for exclamatory, and optionally periods for imperative.</li>
        <li>Vary sentence types to make writing more interesting and avoid monotony.</li>
        <li>Ensure clauses are complete; avoid fragments or run-on sentences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Declarative:</strong> The sun sets in the west.<br>
        <strong>Interrogative:</strong> Where is my notebook?<br>
        <strong>Imperative:</strong> Please pass the salt.<br>
        <strong>Exclamatory:</strong> I can’t believe we won!<br>
        <strong>Simple:</strong> The dog barked loudly.<br>
        <strong>Compound:</strong> I went to the store, and I bought some milk.<br>
        <strong>Complex:</strong> Although it was raining, we went for a walk.<br>
        <strong>Compound-Complex:</strong> I finished my homework, and I watched TV because I needed a break.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the sentence type (by purpose): "Please sit down."</li>
        <li>Identify the sentence type (by structure): "I like coffee, but she prefers tea."</li>
        <li>Write a complex sentence about your morning routine.</li>
        <li>Transform this simple sentence into a compound sentence: "She studies hard."</li>
        <li>Identify the exclamatory sentence: "What a surprise to see you here!"</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Answers / Explanation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Imperative</li>
        <li>Compound</li>
        <li>Answers will vary. Example: "Although I was tired, I went jogging this morning."</li>
        <li>Example: "She studies hard, and she gets good grades."</li>
        <li>Exclamatory</li>
      </ol>
