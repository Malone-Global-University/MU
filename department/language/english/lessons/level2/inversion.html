      <h1>Inversion</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Inversion occurs when the normal word order of a sentence (subject + verb) is reversed, usually for emphasis, formality, or in conditional sentences. It is common in advanced English grammar.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Inversion</strong> is the reversal of the normal word order in a sentence, often placing the verb or auxiliary verb before the subject. It can occur for emphasis, stylistic effect, or in conditional structures.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use inversion after negative adverbials at the beginning: <em>Never have I seen such a view.</em></li>
        <li>In conditional sentences without “if”: <em>Had I known, I would have called.</em></li>
        <li>Use inversion in questions: <em>Are you coming?</em></li>
        <li>Use inversion with “so” + adjective/adverb: <em>So beautiful was the sunset that we stayed longer.</em></li>
        <li>Inversion is optional for emphasis but formalizes the sentence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Negative adverbial inversion: <em>Rarely have I eaten such delicious food.</em></li>
        <li>Conditional inversion: <em>Had I arrived earlier, I would have met her.</em></li>
        <li>Question inversion: <em>Did you see the show?</em></li>
        <li>So / Such inversion: <em>So loud was the music that I could not sleep.</em></li>
        <li>Not only inversion: <em>Not only did he win the race, but he also broke the record.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Rewrite with inversion: “I have never seen such a beautiful painting.”</li>
        <li>Rewrite with inversion: “If I had known, I would have helped.”</li>
        <li>Question inversion: Form a question from “You are ready.”</li>
        <li>Rewrite with so inversion: “The view was so amazing that we stayed for hours.”</li>
        <li>Rewrite with not only inversion: “He not only passed the exam, but he also got the highest score.”</li>
      </ol>
