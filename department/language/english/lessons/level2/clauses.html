      <h1>Clauses</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Clauses are groups of words that contain a subject and a predicate. Understanding clauses helps in building complex and clear sentences.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb. Clauses can be independent (standalone) or dependent (cannot stand alone). Dependent clauses usually begin with subordinating conjunctions or relative pronouns.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Clauses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Independent Clause:</strong> Expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence. <em>Example:</em> I enjoy reading.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent (Subordinate) Clause:</strong> Cannot stand alone and depends on an independent clause. <em>Example:</em> because I was tired, which I borrowed from my friend.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Clause:</strong> A type of dependent clause introduced by a relative pronoun (who, whom, whose, which, that) and modifies a noun. <em>Example:</em> The book <em>that you lent me</em> is amazing.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbial Clause:</strong> Acts as an adverb, modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb. <em>Example:</em> I stayed home <em>because it was raining</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Noun Clause:</strong> Acts as a noun in a sentence. <em>Example:</em> <em>What she said</em> surprised everyone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every independent clause can function as a sentence by itself.</li>
        <li>Dependent clauses must be attached to an independent clause to form a complete sentence.</li>
        <li>Use commas correctly with dependent clauses, especially when they come at the beginning of a sentence. <em>Example:</em> Because it was raining, we stayed inside.</li>
        <li>Relative clauses should immediately follow the noun they modify to avoid confusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Independent:</strong> She likes chocolate.<br>
        <strong>Dependent:</strong> Although she was tired, she finished her homework.<br>
        <strong>Relative:</strong> The man <em>who lives next door</em> is a teacher.<br>
        <strong>Adverbial:</strong> I called her <em>after I arrived home</em>.<br>
        <strong>Noun:</strong> <em>What he decided</em> surprised everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the independent clause: "Although it was cold, we went for a walk."</li>
        <li>Identify the dependent clause: "I will join you if I finish my homework."</li>
        <li>Underline the relative clause: "The car that he bought last week is red."</li>
        <li>Write a sentence with an adverbial clause showing reason.</li>
        <li>Identify the noun clause in: "I don’t know what she wants."</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Answers / Explanation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Independent Clause: <strong>we went for a walk</strong></li>
        <li>Dependent Clause: <strong>if I finish my homework</strong></li>
        <li>Relative Clause: <strong>that he bought last week</strong></li>
        <li>Example answer: "I stayed home because I was feeling sick."</li>
