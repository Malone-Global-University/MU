      <h1>Pronouns</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Pronouns are words that replace nouns in a sentence. They help avoid repetition and make sentences clearer and smoother.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>pronoun</strong> is a word used in place of a noun or a noun phrase. Pronouns refer back to people, places, things, or ideas already mentioned or easily identified.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Pronouns</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Pronouns:</strong> Refer to specific people or things. <em>Example:</em> I, you, he, she, it, we, they.</li>
        <li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> Show ownership. <em>Example:</em> mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflexive Pronouns:</strong> Refer back to the subject of the sentence. <em>Example:</em> myself, yourself, himself, herself, themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrative Pronouns:</strong> Point to specific things. <em>Example:</em> this, that, these, those.</li>
        <li><strong>Interrogative Pronouns:</strong> Used to ask questions. <em>Example:</em> who, whom, whose, which, what.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Pronouns:</strong> Introduce relative clauses. <em>Example:</em> who, whom, whose, which, that.</li>
        <li><strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Refer to non-specific people or things. <em>Example:</em> someone, anyone, everyone, nothing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pronouns must agree in number and gender with the nouns they replace. <em>Example:</em> Sarah lost <strong>her</strong> book. (not his)</li>
        <li>Reflexive pronouns are used only when the subject and object are the same. <em>Example:</em> I taught myself to play guitar.</li>
        <li>Demonstrative pronouns point out specific nouns, singular or plural. <em>Example:</em> This is my favorite song. / Those are beautiful flowers.</li>
        <li>Relative pronouns connect clauses to nouns. <em>Example:</em> The man <strong>who</strong> called yesterday is my uncle.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal Pronoun:</strong> <em>He</em> went to the store.<br>
        <strong>Possessive Pronoun:</strong> That book is <em>mine</em>.<br>
        <strong>Reflexive Pronoun:</strong> She prepared <em>herself</em> for the exam.<br>
        <strong>Demonstrative Pronoun:</strong> <em>These</em> are delicious cookies.<br>
        <strong>Interrogative Pronoun:</strong> <em>Who</em> is at the door?<br>
        <strong>Relative Pronoun:</strong> The boy <em>who</em> won the race is my cousin.<br>
        <strong>Indefinite Pronoun:</strong> <em>Someone</em> left their bag in the classroom.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the pronoun: "She is reading a book."</li>
        <li>Choose the correct possessive pronoun: "This pen is (mine / me / I)."</li>
        <li>Rewrite with a reflexive pronoun: "I cooked the meal myself."</li>
        <li>Identify the relative pronoun: "The teacher who helped me is kind."</li>
        <li>Write a sentence using an indefinite pronoun.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Answers / Explanation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>She</strong> (personal pronoun)</li>
        <li><strong>mine</strong></li>
        <li>Correct as is: <strong>myself</strong> already used correctly</li>
        <li><strong>who</strong> (relative pronoun)</li>
        <li>Answers will vary. Example: "Everyone enjoyed the party."</li>
