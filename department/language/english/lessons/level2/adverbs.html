      <h1>Adverbs</h1>
      <p class="lesson-intro">
        Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They provide more information about how, when, where, or to what extent an action occurs.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition / Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>adverb</strong> is a word that describes or gives more detail about a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Adverbs often end in <em>-ly</em>, but not always.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Adverbs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Manner:</strong> Describe how an action occurs. <em>Example:</em> quickly, carefully, loudly.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Time:</strong> Describe when an action occurs. <em>Example:</em> now, yesterday, soon.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Place:</strong> Describe where an action occurs. <em>Example:</em> here, there, everywhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Frequency:</strong> Describe how often an action occurs. <em>Example:</em> always, often, rarely, never.</li>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Degree:</strong> Describe the intensity or extent of an action, adjective, or another adverb. <em>Example:</em> very, quite, almost, too.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adverbs can move within a sentence, but placement can change meaning. <em>Example:</em> She <em>quickly</em> ran home. / She ran home <em>quickly</em>.</li>
        <li>Adverbs that modify adjectives or other adverbs usually come before the word they modify. <em>Example:</em> very tall, extremely carefully.</li>
        <li>Some words can act as adjectives or adverbs depending on context. <em>Example:</em> fast (adj: a fast car / adv: drive fast).</li>
        <li>Many adverbs are formed by adding <em>-ly</em> to adjectives. <em>Example:</em> quick → quickly, happy → happily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Adverb of Manner:</strong> She sang <em>beautifully</em>.<br>
        <strong>Adverb of Time:</strong> I will call you <em>tomorrow</em>.<br>
        <strong>Adverb of Place:</strong> The children played <em>outside</em>.<br>
        <strong>Adverb of Frequency:</strong> He <em>always</em> arrives early.<br>
        <strong>Adverb of Degree:</strong> I am <em>very</em> tired today.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
      <ol>

        <li>Decide the type of adverb: "We will meet tomorrow."</li>
        <li>Write a sentence using an adverb of place.</li>
        <li>Choose the correct adverb of frequency: "He (never / always / here) forgets his keys."</li>

      </ol>

      <h2>Answers / Explanation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>quickly</strong> (adverb of manner)</li>
        <li><strong>tomorrow</strong> (adverb of time)</li>
        <li>Answers will vary. Example: "The cat is sleeping outside."</li>
        <li><strong>always</strong></li>
        <li><strong>very interesting</strong></li>
      </ol>
