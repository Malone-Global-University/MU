What Is a Participle? | Meaning and Examples
Last Updated : 07 Mar, 2024
Participles are verb forms that function as adjectives, modifying nouns or pronouns, and as components of verb tenses, particularly in forming continuous and perfect aspects. A participle is a form of a verb that functions as an adjective which provides additional information about a noun in a sentence.

Participles are not merely grammatical forms but are vital instruments of expression in the English language. They are integral to adding descriptive detail and indicating the time aspect of actions within sentences.

What is a Participle?
Participles are special words in English that come from verbs but can act like adjectives. In other words, a participle is a form of a verb that is used in a sentence to modify nouns or pronouns and to express a compound verb aspect or tense.

A participial phrase includes the participle, an object or complement of the action, and any modifiers. These phrases can provide detailed context, and background information, or describe the conditions of the main clause. Participial phrases can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence and are often set off by commas when they provide extra, non-essential information.

This unique characteristic enables participles to modify nouns and pronouns, contribute to complex verb tenses, and form participial phrases that enhance descriptive detail and narrative flow.

Types of Participles
There are two main types of participles in English: present participle and past participle.

Present Participles: These are formed by adding "-ing" to the base form of a verb (e.g., running, singing, dancing). Present participles convey a sense of ongoing action or state and are used in several grammatical constructs, including:

Forming progressive (continuous) tenses (e.g., "She is running.")
Acting as adjectives to describe nouns (e.g., "a running stream")
Initiating participial phrases that provide additional information or context (e.g., "Running through the fields, she felt free.")
Past Participles: Typically formed by adding "-ed" to regular verbs (e.g., walked, finished, talked) and using irregular forms for irregular verbs (e.g., gone, been, seen), past participles often denote a completed action or state. Their uses include:

Forming perfect tenses (e.g., "He has finished his work.")
Participating in passive voice constructions (e.g., "The work was finished by noon.")
Modifying nouns as adjectives (e.g., "a finished product")
Leading participial phrases that add detail or background (e.g., "Finished with his work, he took a break.")
How to Use Participles?
Using participles effectively in English requires understanding their forms, functions, and how they fit into sentences. Here's a detailed guide on how to use both present and past participles:

Using Present Participles
As Adjectives: Present participles can describe nouns or pronouns, providing more detail. For example, in the sentence "The laughing audience enjoyed the show," "laughing" describes the "audience" and tells us more about their state.
To Form Continuous Tenses: They are used with the auxiliary verbs "be" (am, is, are, was, were) to indicate ongoing actions. For instance, "She is studying for exams" uses "studying" to show that the action is happening now.
In Participial Phrases: These phrases, beginning with a present participle, add information about the time, reason, or condition of actions. "Hoping to find her friend, she searched the entire park." Here, "Hoping to find her friend" provides the reason for the action in the main clause.
Using Past Participles
As Adjectives: Past participles can modify nouns in a similar way to present participles. "The broken vase was on the floor" uses "broken" to describe the "vase."
To Form Perfect Tenses: With the auxiliary verb "have" (has, have, had), past participles express completed actions. "He has finished his work" shows that the work is complete at the present time.
In Passive Voice: Past participles are used to construct passive sentences, where the focus is on the action rather than who performed it. "The book was written by George" emphasizes the book, not George.
In Participial Phrases: Like present participles, past participles can start participial phrases that modify nouns or provide additional context. "Shattered by the news, she couldn't speak" uses "Shattered by the news" to describe her state due to the news.
