# Hook (2 minutes)
Play a 30-second "mystery sound" audio. Students guess the letter/sound.

# Lesson Overview
**Focus:** Letter recognition, phonemic awareness, decoding.

## Materials
- Alphabet chart (printable)
- Flashcards
- Whiteboard or slides

## Guided Instruction (10 minutes)
1. Introduce 5 letters and their sounds.
2. Model blending: /c/ + /a/ + /t/ → "cat".

## Practice (10 minutes)
- Partner blending with flashcards (teacher circulates).

## Independent Practice (8 minutes)
- Worksheets: circle word matching picture.

## Formative Assessment
- Exit ticket: student reads 5 CVC words aloud.

## Differentiation
- *Support:* use picture cues, smaller set of letters.
- *Challenge:* multi-syllable blending practice.

## Reflection (Teacher)
- Notes on pacing, student misconceptions, next lesson focus.
