how many branches does english grammar have?
While there is no single, universally agreed-upon number of branches, English grammar is most commonly broken down into four core components: morphology, syntax, phonology, and semantics. These are the main areas of study within the field of linguistics, though more practical or traditional approaches may categorize it differently. 
The four major linguistic components
From a linguistic perspective, the study of grammar is divided into the following four interdependent branches: 
Morphology: Focuses on how words are formed from morphemes—the smallest units of language that have a meaning. For example, morphology examines how suffixes like "-ed" and "-s" change a word's tense or number.
Syntax: Deals with the rules for arranging words and phrases to form grammatically correct sentences. This includes sentence structure, word order, and the relationships between parts of a sentence.
Phonology: The study of the organization of sounds in a language. A key unit in phonology is the phoneme—the smallest unit of sound that can distinguish words from each other.
Semantics: The study of meaning in a language. This branch focuses on the relationship between words, phrases, and their interpretations. 
Other ways of categorizing grammar
Outside of the four linguistic components, grammar can be examined from different perspectives:
Parts of speech: This traditional approach organizes grammar around the eight or nine categories of words and their functions within a sentence. These include nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
Grammar frameworks: Linguists and language teachers also categorize grammar based on the way it is studied or taught. Examples include:
Prescriptive grammar: Dictates how language should be used based on established rules.
Descriptive grammar: Describes how language is actually used by speakers in everyday life.
Pedagogical grammar: Simplifies grammatical concepts to aid in language learning.
The five fundamental elements: Another framework identifies five foundational principles, including word order, punctuation, tenses, determiners, and connectors.
