Quadratic functions and equations (factoring, completing the square, quadratic formula, complex roots)

Rational expressions and equations, radicals and rational exponents

Exponential and logarithmic functions, sequences, and series

Conic sections (circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas)

Probability and statistics basics (permutations, combinations, binomial probability, normal distribution)

Introduction to trigonometry (angles, unit circle, trigonometric functions, graphs, identities, basic equations)

Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Solve linear, quadratic, radical, rational, exponential, and logarithmic equations.

Analyze and graph a wide variety of functions.

Apply algebraic methods to solve real-world problems.

Prepare for College Algebra, Pre-Calculus, and other advanced mathematics courses.
