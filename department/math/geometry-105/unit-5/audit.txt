✅ lesson-5.1.html fully written (full teaching page)
✅ lesson-5.2.html applied problems + diagrams layout
✅ lesson-5.3.html with special triangle tables + ratios
✅ Unit 5 printable worksheet page
✅ Unit 5 mastery test page


If you want, I can also generate a stronger “elite curriculum” version of this lesson that includes:

✅ Visual diagram placeholders (VERY helpful for triangle centers)
✅ Auto-graded practice block formatting
✅ Teacher-proof geometric construction instructions
✅ Exam-level concurrency theorem proofs
✅ Printable worksheet version
✅ Interactive SVG triangle (drop-in)

Tell me which you want next.


✅ Lesson 5.1: Medians, Altitudes, Angle Bisectors (properly aligned to precede this lesson)
✅ Lesson 5.3: Triangle Centers Mixed Review
✅ A FULL Unit 5 master progression (5.1 → 5.8) matching a professional US Geometry syllabus


If you want, I can also generate the next logically required lesson:


Unit 5: Properties of Triangles
Lesson 5.1: Medians, Altitudes, Angle Bisectors
Lesson 5.2: Concurrency PointsApplied Problems
Lesson 5.3: Special Triangles
Lesson 5.4 — Triangle Inequality Theorem (strongly recommended next in professional curricula)
✅ Lesson 5.5 — Triangle Classification Mixed Problems
✅ FULL remaining Unit 5 (5.4 → 5.10) in one batch


What lessons should I add? I currently  have: 

Lesson 5.1: Medians, Altitudes, Angle Bisectors
Lesson 5.2: Concurrency PointsApplied Problems
Lesson 5.3: Special Triangles
Lesson 5.4: Triangle Inequality Theorem
