If you want, I can also generate the 4 lesson pages themselves next (4.1 → 4.4) with:

✅ structured exercise layouts
✅ printable proof worksheets
✅ diagram placeholders
✅ auto-numbered problems
✅ consistent Geometry-105 formatting


If you want, I can now generate Lesson 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 in the same structured format.

Or (strongly recommended for Geometry courses):

I can switch into Advanced Geometry Worksheet Mode and generate:

✅ diagram-based proof problems (real classroom style)
✅ structured 2-column proof tables
✅ printable teacher solution keys
✅ difficulty tiering (Basic / Standard / Honors)
✅ SAT-style congruence reasoning problems

If you want that, just say:

Generate Lesson 4.2 (worksheet mode)
or
Generate FULL Unit 4 professional classroom version

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ Lesson 4.1 SSS & SAS Proof Exercises (to match this 4.2)
✅ The full Unit 4 complete lesson pack (4.1–4.6) in one batch
✅ A diagram-ready version with SVG triangle placeholders for student worksheets (VERY useful for geometry pages)

Tell me which you want next.

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ Lesson 4.5 (next logical topic: Congruence mixed proof set)
✅ A fully standardized Unit-4 lesson pack (4.1 → 4.8) in one batch
✅ A diagram-ready version with SVG triangle templates students can label
