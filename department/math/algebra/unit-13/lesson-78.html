      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Linear systems are not just abstract equations—they model real-world situations.  
        Applications often involve problems like mixtures, motion, cost/profit, or age problems.

      <h2>Steps for Solving Word Problems</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Read the problem carefully and identify the variables.</li>
        <li>Write one equation for each relationship described.</li>
        <li>Solve the system using substitution or elimination.</li>
        <li>Interpret the solution in the context of the problem.</li>
        <li>Check your solution to ensure it makes sense.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p><strong>Example 1 — Mixture Problem:</strong></p>
      <p>
        A chemist has a 10% acid solution and a 30% acid solution.  
        How many liters of each should be mixed to get 8 liters of a 20% solution?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let x = liters of 10% solution, y = liters of 30% solution:  
        x + y = 8 <br>
        0.10x + 0.30y = 0.20(8)
      </p>
      <p>Solve: x + y = 8 → y = 8 − x <br>
        0.10x + 0.30(8 − x) = 1.6 → 0.10x + 2.4 − 0.30x = 1.6 → −0.20x = −0.8 → x = 4 → y = 4
      </p>

      <p><strong>Example 2 — Motion Problem:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Two cars start from the same point. One travels east at 60 mph, the other north at 50 mph.  
        How far apart are they after 2 hours?
      </p>
      <p>
        x = distance east = 60 × 2 = 120 miles <br>
        y = distance north = 50 × 2 = 100 miles <br>
        Distance apart: d = √(x² + y²) = √(120² + 100²) = √(14400 + 10000) = √24400 ≈ 156.2 miles
      </p>

      <p><strong>Example 3 — Cost/Profit Problem:</strong></p>
      <p>
        A company sells pens for $2 and pencils for $1.50. They sell 100 items and earn $175.  
        How many pens and pencils did they sell?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let x = pens, y = pencils: x + y = 100 <br>
        2x + 1.5y = 175 <br>
        Solve: y = 100 − x → 2x + 1.5(100 − x) = 175 → 2x + 150 − 1.5x = 175 → 0.5x = 25 → x = 50 → y = 50
      </p>

    <section id="practice">
      <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>A mix of nuts: $4 per lb of almonds and $2 per lb of cashews. A 10-lb mix costs $30. How many pounds of each?</li>
        <li>Two trains leave the same station: one at 70 mph, one at 50 mph. After 3 hours, how far apart are they if one goes north and the other east?</li>
        <li>A store sells shirts for $15 and hats for $10. They sell 40 items and make $500. How many of each were sold?</li>
        <li>A tank has 100 liters of solution. How much of 5% and 20% solution should be mixed to get 100 liters of 12% solution?</li>
        <li>A company produces two products. Product A costs $8, product B costs $5. They produce 500 items and spend $3400. How many of each product?</li>
