Quadratic Area and Domain-Restricted Function
1. Geometric Setup: Quadratic as Area

Consider a square with side length 
𝑥
x. Its area is

𝐴
square
=
𝑥
2
.
A
square
	​

=x
2
.

Now consider a rectangle with height 
𝑥
x and base 
𝑏
b. Its area is

𝐴
rectangle
=
𝑏
𝑥
.
A
rectangle
	​

=bx.

We can view the quadratic expression 
𝑥
2
+
𝑏
𝑥
x
2
+bx as the sum of the square’s area and the rectangle’s area. By splitting the rectangle into two equal parts and placing them along the sides of the square, we form a larger square (minus a corner) — this is the classical “complete-the-square” geometric interpretation of a quadratic.

2. Quadratic Inequality as a Physical Constraint

Suppose we impose the condition:

𝑥
2
<
6
𝑥
.
x
2
<6x.

This can be interpreted as:

“The area of the square is less than the area of a reference rectangle of height 
𝑥
x and base 6.”

This inequality naturally restricts the domain of the function: only values of 
𝑥
x that satisfy the inequality correspond to valid, meaningful areas.

3. Solving the Inequality

Factor the inequality:

𝑥
2
<
6
𝑥
⟹
𝑥
(
𝑥
−
6
)
<
0.
x
2
<6x⟹x(x−6)<0.

The product is negative when 
𝑥
∈
(
0
,
6
)
x∈(0,6).

Therefore, the domain of admissible inputs is:

Domain: 
0
<
𝑥
<
6.
Domain: 0<x<6.

Physically, 
𝑥
=
0
x=0 is excluded because a zero-length side produces no area.

The boundary 
𝑥
=
6
x=6 is excluded because the square would then equal the rectangle (
𝑥
2
=
6
𝑥
x
2
=6x), violating the “less than” condition.

For teaching or intuitive purposes, we can describe this as:
“The function is discontinuous after 
𝑥
=
6
x=6,” meaning the inequality no longer holds and the model breaks beyond this point.

4. Functional Interpretation

Define the function:

𝑓
:
(
0
,
6
)
→
𝑅
,
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
.
f:(0,6)→R,f(x)=x
2
.

Inside the open interval 
(
0
,
6
)
(0,6), 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) is smooth and continuous.

At the boundary 
𝑥
=
6
x=6, 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) is not defined within the model, consistent with the domain restriction.

Thus, the domain-restricted function remains mathematically rigorous while reflecting the practical constraint imposed by the inequality.

5. Historical Context

This approach aligns with a tradition of dissenting innovation in mathematics, where practical utility shapes definitions:

René Descartes – Invented Cartesian coordinates but initially dismissed complex numbers.

Carl Friedrich Gauss – Embraced complex numbers, demonstrating that new terminology can serve practical insight.

Leonhard Euler – Revolutionized notation and connected previously disconnected concepts.

Cauchy & Dirac – Formalized calculus and generalized functions in ways initially controversial.

Siméon Denis Poisson – Developed probability theory for rare events, initially resisted.

The “discontinuous after 
𝑥
=
6
x=6” phrasing follows this tradition: it prioritizes practical clarity, preserves the functional interpretation, and communicates the real-world meaning of the area inequality.

6. Summary

Quadratic 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
f(x)=x
2
 models the area of a square.

Inequality 
𝑥
2
<
6
𝑥
x
2
<6x restricts admissible inputs to 
(
0
,
6
)
(0,6).

At 
𝑥
=
6
x=6, the function is undefined relative to the inequality — hence, “discontinuous after 6” in practical terms.

This interpretation is rigorous, intuitive, and historically consistent with mathematical innovation driven by practical utility.
