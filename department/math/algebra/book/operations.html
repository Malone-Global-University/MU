  <h2>The Six Operations</h2>
  <p class="wide">
The four operations in arithmetic are called addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (¬∑), and division (/). Algebra adds two more operations called exponentiation, and radicalization. Together these six operations are called advanced arithmetic. Arithmetic means adding numbers. It is the beginning of all math. Algebra does more than add numbers, it takes numbers and organizes them by using variables, performing functions, graphing, and using formulas.</p>


<p class="wide">
The six operations have symbols called <span class="blue">operators</span>. The operator tells you what operation to do. Every operation has an opposite operation called its <span class="blue">reciprocal operation</span>. The word <em><span class="blue">reciprocal</span></em> and <em><span class="blue">inverse</span></em> almost mean the same thing, but are used slightly differently depending on context. In general all math from arithmetic to calculus is <em><strong>just adding numbers</strong></em>. Here is a table to show some language and what symbol to use:</p>

<p class="wide">
It is important to distinguish what number or symbol you are referring to instead of saying "The number", "squiggle line", or "that thing over there". This is especially important in complex equations that have multiple objects that may refer to the say name. In general math is a binary process where only two numbers are being used at a time. There is the initial value and the number performing the operation. Typically the left number is our "seed" or starting value and the right number is our operating number.</p>

<section class="convention">
<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<p class="wide">There are multiple names for the same number being used:</p>

<h3>Addition</h3>
<p class="wide">A numberal is a symbol that represents a number. For any operation a value can be called a "number", "value", or a "sum". Addition can call both augend and addend an "addend", or simply "a sum", "sum", or "sums". The result of addition can be called a total or sum. Less common though valid is to call any number a "total", however "sum" is preferred. In any case both "sum" and "total" imply addition or the result of it. The operator for addition uses this symbol " + " and is called "plus sign" or "addition sign".</p>

<h3>Subtraction</h3>
<p class="wide">In subtraction we can say "ten minus one", "one subtracted from ten", "one less than ten", "the difference between ten and one", and so on because math allows non fixed use of English phrases. This is semantically valid as long as the sentence uttered is logically true. The result of subtraction is called "the difference", "a difference", or even a "total" or "sum". The symbol for subtraction is " - " and is called the subtraction or minus sign.</p>


<h3>Multiplication</h3>
<p class="wide">
In arithmetic the raised x symbol " √ó " is used for multiplication. It is commonly called the "times" symbol. We say "two times three equals six" or "two multiplied by three equals six". In algebra we use the raised dot symbol " ‚àô " and language stays the same. Multiplication can also be implied by parentheses or brackets such as 2(3) = 6.  Putting variables infront of a number also implies multiplication. When variables are introduced you will see that "2a" = "2 ‚àô a".</p>   


<h3>Division</h3>
<p class="wide">
In division we usually say "ten divided by two equals five". The format has the "number to be divided" on the left of the division operator followed the number that is "doing the dividing". In this case 10 is the dividend (thing which is to be divided), 2 is the divisor (number which is doing the dividing), and 5 is the quotient (number which is the result of the division.) We will learn that there are many symbols for divison such as the obelus " √∑ ", the forward slash " / ", The horizontal fraction bar, the division box, and the pipe symbol " | ". The pipe symbol is rare and mostly used in computing. It reverses the order of dividend and divisor such that \(10 √∑ 2 = 5\) becomes \(2|10 = 5\). This is spoken as " ten divided by two equals five" and "two divides ten = equals five". Pipe is not used in Malone Math courses but is in Malone Computer Science courses. </p>


<p class="wide">
Fractions and ratios also imply division but they are not quite the same and will be discussed deeper later. Fractions call the dividend a "numerator" and the divisor a "denominator". This closely follows standard division and you may call a fraction a "quotient" such that \(1/4 = 0.25\), where both \(1/4\) and 0.25 are quotients of \(1 √∑ 4\).</p>


<h3>Powers</h3>
<p class="wide">
When a number is being multiplied by itself over and over we call this a "power" or "exponent" operation. Exponentiation is used to show a number being mulitpled by itself many times. Therefore exponentiation is the way of writing "repeated multiplication of the same number". Example: \(2√ó2√ó2 = 2^3 = 8, 2√ó2√ó2√ó2 = 2^4 = 16\). 2 is the base or root number, the 3 and 4 are called the exponents, and the answers given as 8 and 16 are called the "products". Because the answer to a multiplication problem is called a product we use the same word for the result of an exponent operation. Exponents are also called "powers", which is a bit confusing since the word "power" can be used for the exponent, the answer, and the entire equation! To avoid confusion pick a naming convention and stick with it. Malone Math  uses "base", "exponent", and "power" to avoid ambiguity of terms.</p>


<h3>Radicals</h3>
<p class="wide">
Radicals are the result of undoing an exponential equation. Just as division seems harder than multiplication, radicals are harder than exponents. Since exponents are repeated multiplication, radicals are repeated division. \(2√ó2√ó2√ó2 = 16\) which means: \(2^4 = 16\) and since: \(16 √∑ 2 √∑ 2 √∑ 2 = 2\) then: \(^4‚àö16 = 2\)</p>

<h2>Terminology and Intuition</h2>

<p class="wide">
There are six basic operators, 3 are positive and make number bigger, the other 3 are negative and make the number smaller.<br>
The parent operators are + and ‚Äì . All operations come from these as you will see. </p><br>

If we add 27 terms of 3 we have 81. We can group this as 4 groups, means 4 terms, of 3. Groups is the number of terms, amount is the numerical of the term. Numerals are the symbol for a number as opposed to an English word.  ‚ÄúTwo‚Äù is an English word while ‚Äú2‚Äù is an Arabic numeral. When describing a value we use numerals, anything else we use words. And so four groups of 3 is written as  3‚àô3‚àô3‚àô3 or  3+3+3+3 not  4‚àô4‚àô4 or 4+4+4.  If we have four groups of three we can write it as a power 34. This grouped our multiplication, which was a grouping of our addition. We have groups of groups written in a more compact way. </p>

27 terms of 3 gave 81. If we subtract all these terms we have zero. If we instead subtract n‚Äì1 terms we will be left with a single term and have 3. Division and rooting removes all but 1 term of a summation. The exponent is the number of factors we multiply by or the number of roots we are taking. If multiplying we multiply all factors, if rooting we divide by n‚Äì1 factors. We needed the 4th root of 81 so ‚Äún‚Äì1 roots‚Äù is 4‚Äì1 is 3, we divide by 3 factors.</p>

All values in math can be called numbers. To be more specific certain numbers have names to distinguish them from others in an equation.  This creates classifications of numbers. Also a number may be referred to by many names depending on the context and associated action or operation to be performed.</p>

<p class="wide">
All of these words call also be called numbers but this creates more specify. ‚ÄúA number plus a number equals a number‚Äù isn't really informative. Sum simply means number so can be used anywhere. It can be used in subtraction like ‚Äú a sum minus a sum equals a difference‚Äù. Addition and subtraction are very basic so I will not spend much time on them. You can sum positive or negative numbers, summing negatives is like subtraction, you can call two numbers in a subtraction problem sums but subtrahend and minuend are more specific as it distinguishes them from sums in an addition problem. For basic math not important for hard math actually useful. The goal is not to be rigorous or pedantic but provide more clarity when needed, not at the expense of it.

<p class="wide">The plus sign births 3 ways to multiply:</p>


<p class="wide">
Early math: 2 &times; 3 = 6   <br>
Algebra:  2 ‚àô  3 = 6<br>
Reciprocal: 2 √∑ \( {\frac{1}{3}}
\)
 = 6 </p>    

  
<p class="wide">
Dividing by a fraction invokes multiplication. It doesn't need to be proven here but will show anyways:</p>


<p class="wide">2 √∑ 1/3     We are asking how many times 1/3 goes into 2<br>
1/3 + 1/3 +  1/3 = 1        We know this (3/3 =1 so that 1/3 goes into 1 three times)<br>
1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 2     So we know this</p>


<p class="wide">
This is not the cleanest approach but natural. It shows that 1/3 goes into 2 six times. <br>
Said differently 6 times 1/3 equals 2:  \(  6‚àô1/3 = 2\)</p>


<p class="wide">
\(6  ‚àô 1/3 = 2\)          This appears to be a multiplication<br>
\(6/1 ‚àô 1/3 = 2\)<br>
\(6‚àô1/1‚àô3 = 2\)<br>
\(6/3 = 2\)<br>
\(6√∑3 = 2\)         This appears to be a division       </p>


<p class="wide">
Understand that a fraction is a division problem and that the fraction bar is a division operator.  We went from a multiplication operator to a division operator. This is because the fraction is really a division problem we are scaling or multiplying by the first number.</p>


<p class="wide">We use the reciprocal operator and the reciprocal number to create this equivalence:   

\(2 √∑ \( {\frac{1}{3}}\)  =   2 ‚àô \( {\frac{3}{1}}\)    =   6\)</p>


<p class="wide">We could find the quotient directly:</p>
<p class="wide">2 √∑ \( {\frac{1}{3}}\)<br>
2 √∑ 0.3...</p>


<p class="wide">0.3 | 2           This is long division with 2 in a division box</p>


<p class="wide">3.3 | 20        For clarity move the numbers by a power of 10</p>


<p class="wide">
How many times does 3.3 go into 20? The answer is 6. If we divide 20 by 6 we get 3.3 and if we divide 20 by 3 we get 6.6.  This is just something known about repeating decimals but we find it through long division for ourselves.  This bring up a separate topic in math about repeating numbers. After exhaustive research we summarize the rule to be that when dividing by a fraction we multiply by the reciprocal, affectionately known as ‚Äúflip and multiply‚Äù.</p>


<p class="wide">For a clearer demonstration to prove that

‚Äú \( {\frac{a}{b}}\) &divide; \( {\frac{c}{d}}\)
= \( {\frac{a}{b}}\)  &sdot; \( {\frac{d}{c}}\) ‚Äù
 we chose a non repeating decimal:</p>


<p class="wide">
Reciprocal division: \(10 &divide; {\frac{1}{2}}\)
<br>
Obelus: 10√∑0.5<br>
Box: 0.5&#x27CC;10</p>           


<p class="wide">Long divison using the division box:</p>


<code><pre>
0.5 goes into 1 two times:


      2       
0.5&#x27CC;10


2 times 0.5 is 1, we write the 1 and subtract:


      2       
0.5&#x27CC;10
  ‚Äì 1      
     0


We bring down the next number which is 0:


      2      
0.5&#x27CC;10          
  ‚Äì 1      
     00


0.5 goes into 0 to times so we write 0 after 2 and we are finshed:


      20       
0.5&#x27CC;10          
  ‚Äì 1      
     00
  
</pre></code>


<p class="wide">
There are other ways to do long division such as clearing the decimal. We would then ask 100√∑5 and get 20 but this is not as direct as I showed since it changes the numbers slightly.</p>


<p class="wide">
10 √∑ ¬Ω    =       10 ‚àô 2      =       20<br>
10 √∑ ¬Ω    equals    10 ‚àô 2    since     ¬Ω goes into ‚Äú10‚Äù twenty times.  </p>


<p class="wide">
It can be written different ways but all equal the correct answer 20. <br>
Using flip and multiply is fastest and cleanest. You can cross multiply:</p>


<code><pre>
10 √∑ ¬Ω        10 √∑ ¬Ω        10 √∑ ¬Ω 
10/1 √∑ ¬Ω      10/1 √∑ ¬Ω      10‚àô2 
10‚àô2 √∑1‚àô1     10‚àô2 /1‚àô1     20
20 √∑1         20 /1     
20            20      
</pre></code>


<p class="wide">
This gives 3 ways to multiply.  The parent operation minus births 3 ways to divide:</p>


<p class="wide">
Early math: 10 √∑ 2<br>
Algebra:  10/2<br>
Reciprocal:     10 ‚àô ¬Ω        </p>
</section>


<section><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="wide">
All math is a binary process meaning you can only operate with two numbers and one operator at a time. All rooting problems break down to division and division breaks down to subtraction. Subtraction is the parent operator of higher negative operations. Likewise powering breaks down to multiplication which breaks down to addition with addition being the parent operation of higher positive operations. This is the meaning of addition gives birth to multiplication which gives birth to powering and subtraction gives birth to division which gives birth to rooting.</p>
