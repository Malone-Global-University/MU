📘 Unit 14: Probability & Statistics
Lesson 84 — Introduction to Probability

Goal: Understand basic probability concepts.

Definition: Probability = 
favorable outcomes
total outcomes
total outcomes
favorable outcomes
	​

.

Sample space, events, outcomes.

Experimental vs. theoretical probability.

Example:

Flip a coin → 
𝑃
(
heads
)
=
1
2
P(heads)=
2
1
	​

.

Roll a die → 
𝑃
(
even
)
=
3
6
=
1
2
P(even)=
6
3
	​

=
2
1
	​

.

Lesson 85 — Counting Principles and Combinatorics

Goal: Learn to count outcomes systematically.

Fundamental Counting Principle (multiply choices).

Permutations (
𝑃
(
𝑛
,
𝑟
)
=
𝑛
!
(
𝑛
−
𝑟
)
!
P(n,r)=
(n−r)!
n!
	​

).

Combinations (
𝐶
(
𝑛
,
𝑟
)
=
𝑛
!
𝑟
!
(
𝑛
−
𝑟
)
!
C(n,r)=
r!(n−r)!
n!
	​

).

Example:

3 shirts, 2 pants → 
3
×
2
=
6
3×2=6 outfits.

How many ways to choose 3 students from 10? 
𝐶
(
10
,
3
)
=
120
C(10,3)=120.

Lesson 86 — Probability Rules (Addition, Multiplication)

Goal: Apply rules for multiple events.

Addition Rule: 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∪
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
+
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
−
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B).

Multiplication Rule:

Independent: 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
×
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∩B)=P(A)×P(B).

General: 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
×
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
P(A∩B)=P(A)×P(B∣A).

Example:

Deck of cards: 
𝑃
(
red or face card
)
P(red or face card).

Dice roll: 
𝑃
(
even and > 3
)
P(even and > 3).

Lesson 87 — Independent and Dependent Events

Goal: Distinguish independence and dependence.

Independent: Events don’t affect each other.

Dependent: One event changes probability of the other.

Example:

Independent: Rolling two dice.

Dependent: Drawing 2 cards without replacement.

Lesson 88 — Random Variables and Expected Value

Goal: Model outcomes with random variables.

Random variable = assigns number to outcomes.

Expected value = weighted average:

𝐸
(
𝑋
)
=
∑
[
𝑥
⋅
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
]
E(X)=∑[x⋅P(x)].

Example:

Coin toss (X = number of heads).

Lottery ticket: win $100 with prob 0.01, lose $1 with prob 0.99.

𝐸
(
𝑋
)
=
(
100
)
(
0.01
)
+
(
−
1
)
(
0.99
)
=
−
0.99
E(X)=(100)(0.01)+(−1)(0.99)=−0.99.

Lesson 89 — Descriptive Statistics

Goal: Summarize and describe data.

Measures of center: mean, median, mode.

Measures of spread: range, variance, standard deviation.

Example:
Data: 2, 4, 6, 8.

Mean = 5, Median = 5, Mode = none.

Range = 6.

Variance = 5, Std Dev = 
5
5
	​

.

Lesson 90 — Probability Distributions (Binomial, Normal)

Goal: Understand major probability models.

Binomial Distribution: fixed trials, success/failure.
Formula: 
𝑃
(
𝑋
=
𝑘
)
=
𝐶
(
𝑛
,
𝑘
)
𝑝
𝑘
(
1
−
𝑝
)
𝑛
−
𝑘
P(X=k)=C(n,k)p
k
(1−p)
n−k
.

Normal Distribution: bell curve, mean μ, std dev σ.

Empirical Rule: 68–95–99.7%.

Example:

Binomial: Probability of 3 heads in 5 flips.

Normal: Heights of students (μ=170cm, σ=10cm).
