<h2>Order of Operations</h2>

<p class="wide">The basics of arithmetic are the operations, the order of operations called Pemdas, and the property laws. The acronym Pemdas states the “order of operations”. Operations must be performed in a specific order or else answers will vary. The letters stand for Parentheses, exponents, multiply and divide, addition and subtraction. Parentheses are used to group numbers to show in what order steps should be taken. Equations are solved doing the operations from Pemdas in the order stated. Math is done starting with the most left number then moving right. Something inside parentheses should be done first followed by exponents then multiplication and division, with addition and subtraction at the end. </p>


<p class="wide">Some equations have only one or all operator signs and following the correct order means that two different people will get the same answer. If there were not these rules nobody would agree on the answer. This is the same as how people agree on the order of numbers. If they didn't one person would think 7 or 4 can after 1 in counting. These rules are rules because everybody agreed on the order of numbers and the order of operations.
What is “7 –4∙2” ? The correct answer is – 1 not 6 because multiplication comes before subtraction.</p>

      <td>Subtracting first is wrong: (7–4∙2)</td>

See how following a different order gives different answers? This is why it is important to follow correct process or your answer will be different than everybody else's, like your friends or the answers in a teacher's book. 
Please follow the order so that we all are in agreement. Addition and subtraction can always be done  interchangeably as long as you use the correct sign for negative numbers. In rare cases so can multiplication and division:

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Multiply first: (2∙3÷4)</th>
      <th>This time divide: (2∙3÷4)</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Now divide: 6÷4</td>
      <td>2∙¾ = 6/4</td>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    </tbody>
      <tr>
      <td>This is correct: 1.5</td>
      <td>The answers are the same: 1.5</td>
    </thead>
    </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>(5 + 3 – 1) add 5+3 first</th>
      <th>(5 + 3 – 1) this time add 3–1</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>8 – 1   subtract</td>
      <td>5 + 2    now add</td>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    </tbody>
      <tr>
      <td>7   this is right</td>
      <td>7   the answers are the same.</td>
    </thead>
    </tr>
     </tbody>
</table>



<p class="wide">Why does a different order work this time? Because adding and subtracting are reciprocal, that is they share reciprocity. Changing this order does not matter because they are inverses which means they act like almost the same operation. We see that subtracting a positive is the same as adding a negative like 3–1 = 3+(–1); and that dividing a whole number is the same as multiplying by a fraction such as 10/2 = 10∙½. To be clear 3–1 does not equal 1–3. This will give additive inverses 2, –2. What is implied is 3 – 1 = –1+3 = 2. This is clarified further under Counting Basics.   </p>


<p class="wide">Because + and – are inverse operations order doesn't matter. The are considered the same level. Because  ∙ and ÷ are inverse operations order doesn't matter. The are considered the same level. But we still have to do ∙ and ÷ before + and – . We state this rule as “Multiplication does not share reciprocity with addition”. The problems occur with three or more terms and you alternate level operations. Consider add and subtract as level one and multiply divide as level two. If different levels of operations are involved then you must follow Pemdas left to right.    </p>


<p class="wide">For the example 10/2 = 10∙½ dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by ½ because of fraction laws:</p>

<p class="wide">
10÷2 = 5    10∙ ½ = 10/1 ∙½ = (10∙1)/(1∙2) = 10/2 = 5   both equal 5 
</p>
<p class="wide">
In algebra rewriting an equation is called algebraic manipulation. We do this almost every problem. Four important points: </p>

<ol>
<li>If a number is outside parentheses without an operator you multiply</li>
<li>If a number is in front of a radical you multiply </li>
<li>Rooting is done during “E” in Pemdas</li>
<li>If “ – ”  is outside parentheses you flip all signs inside parentheses</li>
</ol>

<h3>Point 1: For exponents radicals are obvious when to perform because they act like a grouping symbol.</h3>

<p class="wide">3√4 –1    Note that 3√4 = 3∙√4.<br>
3(2) – 1    Note that √4 = 2 such that 3√4 = 3∙(2) a radical is really a ().<br>
6 – 1     Note that – 1 was not under the radical or it would have been grouped leaving 3√3<br>
5</p>


<h3>Point 2: </h3>

<p class="wide">Although the radical symbol “√” means to root  a number, is really a parentheses in disguise. Taking the square root of 4 gave us 2. Since a 3 was in front of √4 we needed to write 3(2). Something like 3(2) means 3∙2. If a number is outside parentheses without an operator you multiply: 3√4 = 3∙√4 = 3(2) = 3∙2 = 6.</p>



<h3>Point 3: </h3>


<p class="wide">There are many rules for exponents. Although Pemdas does not explicitly state when to root it is done during exponents because rooting is the reciprocal operation of powering. In fact rooting uses exponents to determine which root to take be it the square, cube, or higher root. Here is one of the parentheses rules for roots:</p>


<p class="wide">3√4 3   =   3(2)3   =   3∙43   =   3(2∙2∙2)   =    3(8)   =   3∙8   =   24</p>


<p class="wide">First find the root. Then if an exponent is outside of the parentheses power the root before doing anything else.  </p>


<p class="wide">Point 4: </p>


<p class="wide">–1∙any number = –that number.</p>


<p class="wide">This is true: – 1∙4 =  –4     Multiplying by a negative inverts the sign of the number <br>
This is true: –1(7) =  –7       The parentheses here imply multiplication<br>
This is true: –(52) =  –52      A sign outside parentheses inverts the sign of the number<br>
This is true: –(2+3–4 )  = ( –2–3+4)      The additive inverse of   2+3–4    is    –2–3+4 </p>

<p class="wide">Additive inverse means change all plus signs to minus signs and all minus signs to plus signs. We are inverting the operations and this means to reverse them so we are taking its inverse. The operations were additive so we call this type of inverse “additive inverse”.
The slang term for taking an additive inverse is “flipping signs”.</p>


<p class="wide">Multiplying a number n  by –1 creates the additive inverse for that n.<br>
We write a rule, called a formula, that uses the script letter n be mean any number.<br>
We write this rule as an equation and apply it by replacing n  the actual number we want to take the inverse of. The formula for additive inverse is:  n∙ –1 = –n. </p>


<p class="wide">Using letters to represent numbers is called variables. Variables are used to write rules called formulas. Formulas appear in algebra and every branch of math after that.</p>
