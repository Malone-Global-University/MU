<h2>Disclosure</h2>
Different textbooks organize material differently or disagree on definitions of words, phrases, notation, and emphasis. As math evolves attempts are made to unify all branches into one, standardize all conventions into one, and reorder all guiding truths into a single stucture. 

<p class="wide">
Before continuing I am morally obligated to tell you:</p>

<ol>
<li> Debate exists between educators on how math should be taught and distilled.</li>
<li> Math, language, and physics are at odds with each other.</li>
<li> Standard textbooks are written for use with a professor to give lectures and require important classroom discussion among peers.</li>
<li> Standard textbooks emphasis self discovery and rigor which is required at the graduate level but inappropriate at the learning level. The authors forget they too were beginners once and required clear instruction over rigid formal logic.</li>
<li> The balance between rigor and acessability is delicate. Too much hand holding leads to rapid understanding in the beginning but confusion and disillusioned glass ceilings later.</li>
<li> Easy courses lead to servers of the status quo (i.e. for dummies books, get a job etc.), Hard courses lead to designing the status quo. This is the difference between being perfunctatory (as a "functionary") and being an arcitect of future civilizations (a founder, leader etc.)</li>
<li> It is hard to teach "foraml truth" upfront when a person has no exposure to advanced ways of thinking.</li>
<li> Standard process is to give "naive" understanding first, teach computation, then once functionary status is achieved teach "formal logic". </li>
<li> Formal logic is the truth, yet many professors lack intuition ("naiviete") and teach thoeretical abstraction("logic") with no known real world application thus being "can't see the forest for the trees" or "head in the weeds".</li>
<li> Dark economic forces suppress enlightment to eliminate competition. "Bad school systems" create worker bees (functionaries), "good school systems" create manipulators of worker bees (drones/robots).</li>
</ol>
<p class="wide">
The previous statements are well documented fact and NOT conjecture nor debated or contested. Simple <em>crushing</em> proofs for all statements can be provided on demand.</p>

<h2>Nonmenclature</h2>
<p class="wide">
In algebra, the properties (or laws) of operations are a handful of foundational rules that everything else builds on. Different textbooks group them slightly differently, but the core property laws usually include:

<p class="wide">
The "Big Four" for addition and multiplication which are the Commutative Property, Associative Property, Distributive Property, and Identity Property. These four are what is usually meant by "The Properties of Algebra". The Closure Property is sometimes included, sometimes not. Here is a detailed breakdown:</p>


<h3>1. Properties (of operations)</h3>

<p class="wide">
These describe how <b>numbers</b> behave when operations are applied. Theyâ€™re called properties because theyâ€™re inherent features of the number system (like commutativity, associativity, distributivity, identity, inverses, closure). They tell you whatâ€™s true no matter what numbers you plug in. </p>


<h3>2. Laws of Equality</h3>

<p class="wide">
These arenâ€™t about the numbers themselves, but about what youâ€™re allowed to do to both sides of an equation without changing it from being true. The main 4 are the Reflexive Law, Symmetric Law, Transitive Law, Substitution law, with Addition Law of Equality (addition principle), Multiplication Law of Equality (addition principle restated under multiplication) equally important but more supporting Laws. They get called laws rather than properties because they are rules of manipulation, like legal moves in algebra, instead of structural truths about the numbers themselves.</p>


<h3>3. Rules (of thumb) </h3>

<p class="wide">
These are not formal "rules". Some people call properties and laws the "Rules of Algebra", Malone Math does not. In Malone Math rules are ordered steps to find totals or sub-totals. Rules focus not on numbers or equations but procedures. Such produres can be called "algorithms", "routines", or even "tricks". These are not tricks merely codified logic for deriving answers or simplfying an exression.</p>


<h3>4. Principles</h3>

<p class="wide">
"Principles" is an older term for the "laws of equality". Principles state foundational truth about algebraic manipualtion of equations. A principle will try to generalize many laws into one "principle that rules them all". While laws themselves refer to individual operations or conditions, a principle will try to write one law to describe all conditions. Therefore a principle is a generalized rule for all laws of a certain type. As we master math branch by branch we will encounter laws titled "fundamental principles". Almost every branch of math has a fundamental principle. These laws act as rigoursly defined foundational logic defines a single branch or topic of math.</p>


<h3>5. Theorems</h3>

<p class="wide">
A theorem is an algorithm that produces guaranteed results, wihtout saying anything about<em>properties of numbers</em> or <em>laws of equality</em>. In every branch of math there exists one or two main theorems. These theorems are the main takeaway from the branch to learn how to perform computations. Geometry has some 200 or more theorems! Keeping track of them all is a pain. The main ones are Pythagoras Theorem and Heron's Theorem.</p>


<h3>Takeaways:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Properties of Numbers describe numbers.</li>
  <li>Laws of Equality describe balancing equations</li>
  <li>Rules of Algebra describe "math tricks"</li>
  <li>Principles of Mathematics give one law per branch to fully describe the equations within</li>
  <li>Theorems state tested, formulaic truth, that provides <em>proven to happen</em> results</li>
</ul>


<h3>Summary:</h3>

<p class="wide">
Modern education calls everything a property or law. Malone Math clearly delineates 5 types of classification based on what is being described: 1. Properties are of numbers; 2. Laws are of equations (balancing)<sup>[1]</sup>; 3. Rules are of computational steps (algorithms)<sup>[2]</sup> 4. Principles are "generalizations"<sup>[3]</sup> of "laws" that are singular per branch; 5. Theorems are "rules" that are rigoursly defined using formal "logic"<sup>[4]</sup>.</p>

<p class="wide">
foot notes: [1] "Balancing an equation" is foundational to solving equations in algebra and the main technique used.  [2] Algorithms are defined as the "logic" used and the "steps" taken to complete a process. [3] Generalizations are defined in math as statements, called the "general case" that are true for all cases of a type not just some cases. The opposite of the general case is a "special" case that violates the law/rule/theory. [4] Logic is the symbols, operations, and steps used in a process, making it follow very much the definition or relation to an algorithm, however "logic" usually refers to "logical symbolism" and often refers to the symbols used in writing mathematical definitions using formulas called "formal logic".</p>
