<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="wide"></p>
</section>  
The history of mathematics is one of the oldest and richest parts of human knowledge. It stretches back tens of thousands of years and reflects humanity‚Äôs attempts to understand quantity, shape, patterns, and change. Here‚Äôs a broad outline:
</main>

<section id="prehistory">
<h2>Prehistoric Mathematics (before 3000 BCE)</h2>
<p class="wide">
The earliest evidence of math comes from tally marks carved into bones and stones.

Example: the Ishango bone (c. 20,000 BCE, Central Africa), with notches suggesting counting or a lunar calendar.

People likely used math for counting food, livestock, and days, and for designing tools and shelters.

Early geometry appeared in art and architecture (e.g., symmetrical cave paintings, stone circles).</p>

<section id="ancient">
<h2>Mathematics in Ancient Civilizations
</h2>
<p class="wide">
Mesopotamia (Sumerians & Babylonians, 3000‚Äì300 BCE)

Developed a base-60 (sexagesimal) system, which is why we still use 60 minutes in an hour and 360 degrees in a circle.

Had written multiplication tables, algebraic problems, and methods for solving quadratic equations.

Used math for astronomy, calendars, and trade.

Ancient Egypt (3000‚Äì300 BCE)

Used a base-10 system tied to counting with fingers.

Practical math: surveying land, building pyramids, accounting, and trade.

Famous papyri (Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, Moscow Papyrus) show methods for fractions, geometry, and solving simple equations.

Ancient India (1500 BCE‚Äì500 CE)

Early concepts of zero and place value system, which later spread globally.

Sulba Sutras (texts on altar construction) contain geometry, including approximations of ‚àö2 and œÄ.

Later Indian mathematicians (Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara) advanced algebra, trigonometry, and early calculus ideas.

Ancient China (1200 BCE‚Äì1600 CE)

Counting rods and abacus for calculation.

The ‚ÄúNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art‚Äù (c. 200 BCE) includes linear equations, geometry, and engineering applications.

Discovered negative numbers earlier than Europe.

Chinese mathematicians also developed methods for solving polynomial equations.

Ancient Greece (600 BCE‚Äì300 CE)

Focused on abstract, deductive reasoning (mathematics as a science, not just a tool).

Pythagoras (numbers and harmony), Euclid (geometry), Archimedes (calculus-like methods, mechanics), Apollonius (conic sections).

Established proofs and logical structure.

Greek math influenced Roman engineering and later Islamic scholars.
</p>
</section>

<section id="islamic">
<h2>Mathematics in the Islamic Golden Age (800‚Äì1400 CE)
</h2>
<p class="wide">
Scholars translated Greek, Indian, and Babylonian works into Arabic.

Al-Khwarizmi (from whom we get ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù) developed algebra systematically.

Advances in trigonometry, spherical geometry, and astronomy.

Introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals (including zero) to the wider world.
</p>
</section>

<section id="1400-1700">
<h2>European Renaissance & Early Modern Mathematics (1400‚Äì1700)
</h2>
<p class="wide">
Rediscovery of Greek and Islamic texts through Latin translations.

Fibonacci (1200s) introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals to Europe.

Descartes (analytic geometry) and Fermat laid the groundwork for modern algebra and calculus.

Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently in the 1600s.

Math became central to physics, astronomy, and navigation.
</p>
</section>

<section id="1700-1800">
<h2>18th‚Äì19th Century Mathematics
</h2>
<p class="wide">
Rapid expansion: probability (Pascal, Laplace), number theory (Gauss), non-Euclidean geometry (Lobachevsky, Riemann).

Advances in algebra, analysis, and mathematical rigor.

Birth of abstract algebra and modern notation.

Math increasingly applied to economics, statistics, and engineering.
</p>
</section>

<section id="1900-2000">
<h2>20th‚Äì21st Century Mathematics</h2>
<p class="wide">
Explosion of new fields: topology, logic, set theory, computer science, chaos theory, game theory, cryptography.

Applied math shaped modern technology (computers, AI, quantum physics, finance, genetics).

Pure math explored deep structures (e.g., proof of Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994).

Mathematics is now a global, collaborative discipline, building on thousands of years of work across cultures.

üëâ In short: Math began with counting and measuring, grew into logic and proof with the Greeks, merged with algebra and numerals from India and the Islamic world, exploded in the scientific revolution, and today is the language of science, technology, and abstract thought.
