    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Operation Stormfury</strong> was a major U.S. government project conducted from 1962 to 1983 that attempted to 
      weaken hurricanes using weather modification, specifically <strong>silver iodide cloud seeding</strong>. Sponsored by the 
      U.S. Navy, Air Force, and later NOAA, it represents one of the most scientifically significant attempts to control 
      destructive storms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although ultimately discontinued, Stormfury shaped modern meteorology and contributed to public conversations about 
      weather manipulation, geoengineering, and national security.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
      Stormfury was inspired by earlier experiments like <em>Project Cirrus</em>, which attempted to alter hurricane paths 
      in the 1940s. By the 1960s, scientists believed hurricanes could be weakened by forcing the eyewall to expand or 
      reorganize through artificial seeding.
    </p>

    <h2>Scientific Approach</h2>
    <p>
      The project used aircraft to disperse <strong>silver iodide</strong> into the rainbands surrounding the hurricane's eyewall. 
      The hypothesis was:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seeding would freeze supercooled water droplets.</li>
      <li>This would cause a new outer eyewall to form.</li>
      <li>The hurricane’s inner eyewall would weaken.</li>
      <li>Overall wind speeds might decrease by 10–30%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Field Experiments</h2>
    <p>
      Stormfury carried out seeding missions in several Atlantic hurricanes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hurricane Esther (1961)</strong> — early trials showed possible weakening.</li>
      <li><strong>Hurricane Beulah (1963)</strong> — mixed results with limited data.</li>
      <li><strong>Hurricane Debbie (1969)</strong> — reported short-term wind reductions of up to 31%.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These findings initially encouraged optimism, but later analysis cast doubt on whether seeding caused the observed changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Controversies and Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Operation Stormfury faced multiple challenges:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Many hurricanes lacked the right structure for seeding.</li>
      <li>Eyewall replacement cycles were later discovered to occur naturally.</li>
      <li>The project was limited to Atlantic storms far from land due to safety regulations.</li>
      <li>Political concerns emerged over potential side effects or unintended landfall changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As weather science advanced into the 1970s, researchers increasingly questioned whether silver iodide could meaningfully 
      influence hurricane dynamics.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination of the Program</h2>
    <p>
      By 1983, Stormfury was officially cancelled due to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of scientific evidence supporting the original hypothesis</li>
      <li>Insufficient hurricanes meeting experimental requirements</li>
      <li>Improved understanding of internal hurricane mechanisms</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
    <p>
      Despite its cancellation, Operation Stormfury had lasting impacts on meteorology:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved satellite hurricane tracking</li>
      <li>Better understanding of eyewall replacement cycles</li>
      <li>Advances in hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and instrumentation</li>
      <li>Influence on modern discussions about hurricane modification and climate engineering</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Stormfury remains a landmark example of government attempts to control severe weather, and it continues to be cited in 
      both scientific literature and conspiracy discussions about weather manipulation.
