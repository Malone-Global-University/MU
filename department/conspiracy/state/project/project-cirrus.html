    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Project Cirrus</strong> was one of the first organized efforts to modify weather, conducted in the United States 
      starting in 1947. Sponsored by the U.S. Army Signal Corps, the U.S. Navy, and General Electric, the project aimed to explore 
      <strong>cloud seeding</strong> techniques to influence precipitation and control severe weather events, particularly hurricanes.
    </p>
  </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Goals and Motivation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Investigate whether hurricanes could be weakened or redirected by artificial means.</li>
      <li>Understand cloud physics and precipitation mechanisms through seeding experiments.</li>
      <li>Develop practical weather modification capabilities for military, agricultural, or civil applications.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Project Cirrus primarily used <strong>silver iodide cloud seeding</strong>. Scientists dropped silver iodide crystals 
      from aircraft into clouds to stimulate ice crystal formation, intending to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accelerate precipitation in rain-producing clouds</li>
      <li>Modify hurricane paths or intensity</li>
      <li>Collect data on cloud dynamics for future research</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Notable Experiments</h2>
    <p>
      In 1947, Project Cirrus attempted to modify a hurricane off the coast of Georgia by seeding it with silver iodide. 
      After seeding, the hurricane changed course and struck Savannah, Georgia, causing damage. While this was likely coincidental, 
      it fueled controversy and public concern about the dangers of human intervention in weather systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional experiments throughout the late 1940s involved cloud seeding over various regions of the U.S., including Florida and 
      the Northeast, with mixed results.
    </p>
  </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced understanding of cloud microphysics and precipitation processes.</li>
      <li>Provided early evidence that hurricanes and clouds are complex, sensitive systems.</li>
      <li>Laid groundwork for later programs such as Project Stormfury (1960s–80s) and modern cloud seeding initiatives.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Controversies and Public Perception</h2>
    <p>
      Project Cirrus became controversial due to several factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Perceived connection between cloud seeding and hurricane damage.</li>
      <li>Fears that weather modification could be weaponized in military conflicts.</li>
      <li>Early public exposure to secretive military research during the postwar period.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The apparent failure of seeding experiments to reliably control weather contributed to skepticism about the feasibility of 
      geoengineering. Nonetheless, Project Cirrus remains a historically significant example of early human attempts to intervene 
      in natural weather systems.
    </p>
  </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrated the scientific potential and limits of cloud seeding.</li>
      <li>Influenced subsequent U.S. weather modification research programs.</li>
      <li>Contributed to later debates on weather warfare, climate intervention, and ethical governance of environmental modification.</li>
    </ul>
