      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Weather modification has a long, complex, and often secretive history. While some programs are confirmed historical operations and others remain speculative or unverified, together they form a timeline that documents the evolution of weather control, geoengineering, and military meteorology from early cloud‑seeding experiments to modern strategic concerns. This page provides a chronological overview of major milestones, both officially documented and conspiratorially claimed, to help students understand how weather manipulation entered scientific research, military doctrine, and global geopolitical debates.

      <h2>Weather Warfare Timeline (1900s–Present)</h2>
      <h3>Early Concepts & First Experiments (1900–1945)</h3>

      <1900s–1930s — Early Theories of Artificial Rain

Inventors, scientists, and aviation pioneers propose methods to force rainfall using explosions, electrical charges, and atmospheric dust.

1940s — Birth of Cloud Seeding

Scientists discover that silver iodide can trigger ice formation in clouds.

Cloud‑seeding experiments begin in academic settings.

The Dawn of Militarized Weather Modification (1946–1959)
1946 — Project Cirrus

First major U.S. cloud‑seeding experiment (General Electric + U.S. Army + Navy).

A hurricane is seeded; it unexpectedly changes direction, sparking controversy and fueling later conspiracy narratives.

1950s — Cold War Research Expands

Both the U.S. and the USSR investigate atmospheric manipulation.

Weather control is viewed as a potential strategic weapon.

1958 — President Eisenhower Briefed on Weather Control Possibilities

Documents reveal government interest in artificial rainfall, fog dissipation, and hurricane steering.

Weather Control Goes Mainstream (1960–1966)
1960 — Establishment of NASA

Satellites begin providing global weather data, enabling the first real-time analysis useful for large-scale modification attempts.

1960s — Cloud Seeding Becomes Widespread

Over 40 U.S. states and numerous foreign governments attempt weather modification for:

Rain enhancement

Hail suppression

Fog clearing

1966 — “Interdepartmental Committee for Atmospheric Sciences” Report

U.S. government outlines long-term goals for weather modification research, including:

Storm steering

Climate modification

Large-scale precipitation control

This report becomes a major item cited in conspiracy analyses.

The Era of Confirmed Weather Warfare (1967–1972)
1967–1972 — Operation Popeye (Vietnam War)

Verified U.S. military weather warfare operation.

Cloud seeding used to extend monsoon season, flood enemy supply routes.

Mission motto: “Make mud, not war.”

Program kept classified until 1974.

1969–1971 — Project Stormfury

U.S. attempts to weaken hurricanes through cloud seeding.

Results largely inconclusive, but demonstrates serious government interest in storm manipulation.

International Response (1973–1979)
1972 — Popeye Exposure

Jack Anderson’s reporting reveals the secret operation.

1977 — ENMOD Treaty

UN Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques

Bans weather modification for warfare.

Acknowledges potential for harmful manipulation of:

Climate

Oceans

Atmosphere

Weather patterns

The treaty itself becomes major evidence cited in conspiracy theories because it implicitly confirms the possibility of environmental manipulation.

The Modern Era of Weather Control Research (1980–1995)
1980s — U.S. & USSR Continue Research

Although officially non-military, cloud seeding and atmospheric manipulation experiments continue globally.

1990 — Weather Satellites Improve

New technology allows ultra-precise monitoring of storms, making hypothetical steering more feasible.

1993 — Project Stormfury Ends

Determined to be scientifically ineffective, though still historically significant.

Rise of Conspiracy Interpretations (1996–2005)
1996 — “Owning the Weather in 2025” Published

U.S. Air Force think‑piece describes hypothetical future battlefield weather control.

Though not a program, it becomes one of the most frequently cited weather warfare documents online.

Late 1990s — Chemtrails Enter Popular Culture

Claims emerge that unidentified jets release chemical aerosols for weather manipulation.

1999–2001 — HAARP Gains Attention

High‑frequency research facility becomes center of theories about:

Weather manipulation

Earthquake triggering

Ionospheric heating weapons

Large‑Scale Geoengineering Research (2006–Present)
2006 — Geoengineering Re-Emerges Publicly

Scientists begin discussing climate intervention technologies openly:

Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)

Marine Cloud Brightening

Solar Radiation Management (SRM)

2008 — China Deploys Cloud Seeding for Olympics

One of the largest weather modification operations ever conducted.

2010s — Expansion of National Weather Programs

Many countries operate cloud-seeding programs:

UAE

China

United States (state-level)

India

Russia

2015–Present — Climate Engineering Becomes Mainstream Science

Weather modification research shifts toward:

Climate mitigation

Wildfire management

Drought relief

Solar radiation control

Present — Ongoing Debates

The intersection of:

confirmed historical operations

modern climate engineering research

military weather documents
…keeps weather warfare theories active.
