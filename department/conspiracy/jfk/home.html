    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 remains one of the most debated events in American history. While the official conclusion of the Warren Commission held that 
      <strong>Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone</strong>, public skepticism has persisted for decades. Polls consistently show that a majority of Americans believe there was some form of conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page explores the major theories, evidence, inconsistencies, and historical context — not to promote any single theory, but to help students evaluate the available information critically.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>The Official Narrative: Oswald as the Lone Gunman</h2>
    <p>
      According to the Warren Commission (1964), Oswald fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository using a 6.5mm Mannlicher–Carcano rifle. Key elements of the official explanation include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oswald’s Marines rifle training and proficiency.</li>
      <li>The “single bullet theory” explaining the wounds to Kennedy and Governor John Connally.</li>
      <li>Eyewitness testimony placing Oswald in the building during the shooting.</li>
      <li>Ballistics evidence linking shell casings and the rifle to Oswald.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Critics argue that the Commission glossed over inconsistencies, refused to consider alternative explanations, and relied heavily on assumptions to preserve the lone-gunman conclusion.

    <h2>Major Conspiracy Theories</h2>
    <p>Below are the most influential theories that challenge the official story.</p>

    <h3>1. The CIA Conspiracy Theory</h3>
    <p>
      This theory suggests that elements within the CIA had motive and operational capability to eliminate Kennedy. Key points cited by proponents:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>JFK’s intention to reduce CIA power after the Bay of Pigs fiasco.</li>
      <li>Operation Northwoods, a documented plan showing willingness to stage events.</li>
      <li>Former CIA agents (e.g., E. Howard Hunt) allegedly making deathbed confessions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. The Mafia Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Organized crime leaders allegedly felt threatened by Kennedy’s crackdown spearheaded by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mafia–CIA cooperation during Castro assassination attempts.</li>
      <li>Jack Ruby, Oswald’s killer, having known ties to organized crime.</li>
      <li>Mafiosi claiming involvement (e.g., Carlos Marcello, Sam Giancana).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. The Soviet or Cuban Theory</h3>
    <p>
      During the Cold War, Kennedy was deeply entangled in conflicts with the USSR and Cuba. Theories cite:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oswald’s defection to the Soviet Union.</li>
      <li>His pro-Castro activism in New Orleans.</li>
      <li>Khrushchev and Castro’s anger after the Cuban Missile Crisis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. The “Multiple Shooters / Grassy Knoll” Theory</h3>
    <p>
      One of the earliest and most resilient theories is that shots were fired from the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eyewitnesses reporting smoke or movement behind the fence.</li>
      <li>The “acoustic evidence” controversially introduced by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).</li>
      <li>Frame-by-frame analysis of the Zapruder film suggesting a front impact.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Zapruder Film</h2>
    <p>
      The Zapruder film is the most important piece of visual evidence. It has fueled decades of debate over:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of shots fired.</li>
      <li>Direction of bullet impacts.</li>
      <li>Timing inconsistencies with Oswald's rifle cycle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Interpretations vary widely, demonstrating how evidence can shape — and be shaped by — theory.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Warren Commission vs. HSCA</h2>
    <p>
      Two major government investigations reached two different conclusions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Warren Commission (1964):</strong> Oswald acted alone. No conspiracy.</li>
      <li><strong>House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979):</strong> Kennedy was “probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The difference largely stems from acoustic analysis — later disputed — but the HSCA marked the first (and only) official acknowledgment that there may have been more than one shooter.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why the JFK Assassination Still Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond the historical tragedy, the assassination remains important because it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>shaped public distrust of the government</li>
      <li>influenced Cold War policy and American politics</li>
      <li>became the origin point of modern conspiracy culture</li>
      <li>raised questions about secrecy, intelligence agencies, and transparency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For many, the unanswered questions form a symbolic debate about power, democracy, and truth in America.
