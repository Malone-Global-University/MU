  <h2>Contextual Framing</h2>
  <p class="wide">A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime or a secret plot for an evil or illegal purpose. In a legal context, this involves both the agreement and an "overt act" to further the plan. The term is also used to describe a conspiracy theory, which is an explanation for an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy by powerful actors, often in a way that is unproven.</p>


<h3>Legal definition</h3>

<p class="wide">
  A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more individuals to carry out an illegal act.
  To be a crime, the agreement must be followed by an "overt act" from one of the parties involved.
  Example: In some jurisdictions, agreeing to commit a crime and taking a step to advance it, such as buying a weapon or meeting to plan the details, is illegal. </p>


<h3>Conspiracy theories</h3>

  <p class="wide">
  These are explanations for events that involve secret plots by powerful groups, often making direct evidence hard to source. Many political conspiracies are <b>classified by national security</b> and only later exposed when any <b>accountability is impossible because all actors involved are dead</b>.</p>


<h3>Researcher’s Position (Joseph Malone)</h3>

  <p class="wide">
  Malone Global University approaches conspiracy studies as a discipline of truth-seeking grounded in historical fact, legal reasoning, and civic ethics. We study not to speculate, but to prevent, transforming rumor into reason, and theory into structural reform. This makes me a conspiracy "researcher" rather than a "theorist". Everyone has a "theory", I provide logic grounded in historical fact. This leads to <b>building robust systems to prevent any future harm whether real or imagined as a threat</b>.</p>

  <h3>Editorial Note</h3>
    <p class="wide">Malone Global University distinguishes between <strong>conspiracy as crime</strong>, <strong>conspiracy theory as narrative</strong>, and <strong>inquiry as method</strong>. This framework allows students to critically evaluate claims, evidence, and historical context without defaulting to dismissal or sensationalism.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Classification System of Conspiracies</h2>
        <p class="wide">Conspiracies can be listed by type (perpetrator), level of verifiable evidence, or by damage to society being claimed. "Type" of conspiracy is who is being accused: government agencies, industrial corporations, or private groups like ngos, charities, religions, and organized crime.</p>
    <p class="wide">This taxonomy provides a framework for analyzing conspiracy theories involving African Americans and related global figures. Each category distinguishes between intent, evidence, and cultural impact (teaching angle).</p>

    </table>

    <p class="wide">Each conspiracy can be tagged by <strong>Type</strong>, <strong>Evidence Tier</strong>, and <strong>Cultural Impact</strong>. This helps students and researchers evaluate patterns, not just claims. Key Examples categorized by their primary conspiracy type: </p>
     

    <h3>Political Suppression</h3>
    <p>Cases such as COINTELPRO, the surveillance of Malcolm X, and the deaths of Black leaders illustrate patterns of suppression justified as national security operations.</p>

    <h3>Economic & Corporate Exploitation</h3>
    <p>Corporate control over creative output—music catalogs, film rights, or invention patents—often fuels theories about ownership theft and exploitation.</p>

    <h3>Scientific, Medical & Technological</h3>
    <p>Historical malpractice, such as the Tuskegee Study and Henrietta Lacks, forms the factual basis for modern mistrust in medicine and science among African Americans.</p>

    <h3>Cultural & Psychological Manipulation</h3>
    <p>Media narratives and industry patterns influence identity formation and reinforce stereotypes, sometimes leading to suspicion of deliberate image control.</p>

    <h3>Esoteric, Spiritual & Fringe</h3>
    <p>From celebrity “Illuminati” myths to lost-tribe theories, these conspiracies often express deeper cultural anxieties and spiritual interpretations of power.</p>

    <h3>Cover-Up & Erasure</h3>
    <p>Lost records, suppressed archives, and erased histories—such as those surrounding Black Wall Street—represent the tangible side of conspiratorial silencing.</p>

 <section id="veracity">
        <h2>Veracity</h2>
        <p>This page surveys three categories of claims that circulate about conspiracies targeting African Americans: <strong>verified historical abuses</strong>, <strong>widespread but disputed theories</strong>, and <strong>modern fringe claims</strong>. Where applicable we distinguish solid documentary evidence from plausible but unproven assertions, and we provide discussion questions and primary-source leads for classroom use.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="verified">
        <h2>1. Verified Historical Conspiracies</h2>
        <p>These events are supported by archival records, government reports, judicial findings, or admitted policy. They are foundational to understanding contemporary mistrust.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment (1932–1972):</strong> U.S. Public Health Service tracked untreated syphilis in Black men without informed consent and withheld effective treatment after penicillin became available.</li>
          <li><strong>COINTELPRO (1956–1971):</strong> FBI programs that infiltrated, disrupted, and attempted to discredit Black civil-rights and nationalist organizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Redlining and Institutional Economic Exclusion:</strong> Housing, lending, and urban policy practices that systematically restricted Black property ownership and wealth accumulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical and Reproductive Abuses:</strong> From unethical gynecological experiments on enslaved women to coerced sterilizations of poor and minority women under eugenics-era policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Surveillance and Harassment of Leaders:</strong> Verified FBI surveillance of Black leaders (for example, efforts to undermine Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="disputed">
        <h2>2. Widespread &amp; Debated Claims</h2>
        <p>These theories grew out of documented abuses and community experience. Some contain kernels of truth or documented connections; others remain unproven.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HIV/AIDS as a Targeted Weapon:</strong> Rumors that HIV was engineered to target Black and gay communities arose in the 1980s. Scientific consensus traces HIV to zoonotic origins, but historical neglect and timing of human genome project explain the persistence of the claim.</li>
          <li><strong>Drug Epidemic &amp; Foreign Policy Connections:</strong> Investigations and reporting have revealed links between covert foreign-policy operations and narcotics flows; allegations that U.S. agencies intentionally flooded Black neighborhoods with crack cocaine are contested and politically charged. IYKYK.</li>
          <li><strong>Covert Sterilization Programs:</strong> While forced sterilizations did occur in the U.S. (affecting poor and minority women), evidence for a coordinated national program intentionally targeted at Black women is mixed — though local abuses are documented. At the very least government was aware but did nothing.</li>
          <li><strong>Public-Health Distrust (Vaccines, Trials):</strong> Historical abuses make some communities skeptical of vaccination campaigns or clinical trials; most claims of intentional depopulation lack credible evidence.</li>
          <li>Narratives of secret societies orchestrating celebrity outcomes or cultural control exclusively to harm Black artists or their fans.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="fringe">
        <h2>3. Modern Fringe Claims</h2>
        <p>Often amplified online, these theories usually lack documentary support and blend symbolic critique with literal allegation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Claims about 5G, chemtrails, or water fluoride intentionally harming Black communities.</li>
          <li>Conspiracy claims tied to DNA databases (surveillance, unauthorized cloning) without evidentiary backing.</li>
          <li>Aliens, spernatural forces, belief in God.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="why">
        <h2>Why These Stories Persist</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Historical Precedent: Real conspiracies (Tuskegee, COINTELPRO) prove that distrust is justified.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Systemic Opacity: Secrecy around policing, surveillance, and policy indicates guilt.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Undenial Truth: Personal experience is irrefutable in the face of denial and cover-ups.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Counter Forensics: Counter conspiracies are created to distract and discredit actual conspiracies.</strong> </li>
        </ol>

    The following books are by Illuminati (Latin for dickhead) agents who snitch on themselves. Sometimes they follow a specific format to gain reader trust: 1. appearing as a truther 2. staging it as agenda free search for truth 3. claim they are not experts merely curious citizens 4. admit they are as vulnerable to manipulation as anyone else.</p>
