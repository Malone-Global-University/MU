    <h1>Conspiracy Department</h1>
    <p>All Black people talk about in the hood are conspiracies. Here is the truth who is collectively out to sabotage blacks viewed through the lens of educated street culture as a serious displine.</p>

  <h2>Contextal Framing</h2>
  <p class="wide">A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime or a secret plot for an evil or illegal purpose. In a legal context, this involves both the agreement and an "overt act" to further the plan. The term is also used to describe a conspiracy theory, which is an explanation for an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy by powerful actors, often in a way that is unproven.</p>


<h3>Legal definition</h3>

<p class="wide">
  A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more individuals to carry out an illegal act.
  To be a crime, the agreement must be followed by an "overt act" from one of the parties involved.
  Example: In some jurisdictions, agreeing to commit a crime and taking a step to advance it, such as buying a weapon or meeting to plan the details, is illegal. </p>


<h3>Conspiracy theories</h3>

  <p class="wide">
  These are explanations for events that involve secret plots by powerful groups, often making direct evidence hard to source. Many political conspiracies are classified by national security and only later exposed when any accountability is impossible because all actors involved are dead.</p>


<h3>Researcher’s Position (Joseph Malone)</h3>

  <p class="wide">
  Malone Global University approaches conspiracy studies as a discipline of truth-seeking grounded in historical fact, legal reasoning, and civic ethics. We study not to speculate, but to prevent, transforming rumor into reason, and theory into structural reform.
  This makes me a conspiracy "researcher" rather than a "theorist". Everyone has a "theory", I provide logic grounded in historical fact. This leads to building robust systems to prevent any future harm whether real or imagined as a threat.</p>
</section>


 <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This page surveys three categories of claims that circulate about conspiracies targeting African Americans: <strong>verified historical abuses</strong>, <strong>widespread but disputed theories</strong>, and <strong>modern fringe claims</strong>. Where applicable we distinguish solid documentary evidence from plausible but unproven assertions, and we provide discussion questions and primary-source leads for classroom use.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="verified">
        <h2>1. Verified Historical Conspiracies</h2>
        <p>These events are supported by archival records, government reports, judicial findings, or admitted policy. They are foundational to understanding contemporary mistrust.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment (1932–1972):</strong> U.S. Public Health Service tracked untreated syphilis in Black men without informed consent and withheld effective treatment after penicillin became available.</li>
          <li><strong>COINTELPRO (1956–1971):</strong> FBI programs that infiltrated, disrupted, and attempted to discredit Black civil-rights and nationalist organizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Redlining and Institutional Economic Exclusion:</strong> Housing, lending, and urban policy practices that systematically restricted Black property ownership and wealth accumulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical and Reproductive Abuses:</strong> From unethical gynecological experiments on enslaved women to coerced sterilizations of poor and minority women under eugenics-era policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Surveillance and Harassment of Leaders:</strong> Verified FBI surveillance of Black leaders (for example, efforts to undermine Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="disputed">
        <h2>2. Widespread &amp; Debated Claims</h2>
        <p>These theories grew out of documented abuses and community experience. Some contain kernels of truth or documented connections; others remain unproven.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HIV/AIDS as a Targeted Weapon:</strong> Rumors that HIV was engineered to target Black and gay communities arose in the 1980s. Scientific consensus traces HIV to zoonotic origins, but historical neglect and stigma explain the persistence of the claim.</li>
          <li><strong>Drug Epidemic &amp; Foreign Policy Connections:</strong> Investigations and reporting have revealed links between covert foreign-policy operations and narcotics flows; allegations that U.S. agencies intentionally flooded Black neighborhoods with crack cocaine are contested and politically charged.</li>
          <li><strong>Covert Sterilization Programs:</strong> While forced sterilizations did occur in the U.S. (affecting poor and minority women), evidence for a coordinated national program intentionally targeted at Black women is mixed — though local abuses are documented.</li>
          <li><strong>Public-Health Distrust (Vaccines, Trials):</strong> Historical abuses make some communities skeptical of vaccination campaigns or clinical trials; most claims of intentional depopulation lack credible evidence.</li>
          <li>Narratives of secret societies orchestrating celebrity outcomes or cultural control exclusively to harm Black artists.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="fringe">
        <h2>3. Modern Fringe Claims</h2>
        <p>Often amplified online, these theories usually lack documentary support and blend symbolic critique with literal allegation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Claims about 5G, chemtrails, or water fluoride intentionally harming Black communities.</li>
          <li>Conspiracy claims tied to DNA databases (surveillance, unauthorized cloning) without evidentiary backing.</li>
          <li>Aliens, spernatural forces, belief in God.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="why">
        <h2>Why These Stories Persist</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Historical Precedent:Real abuses validate skepticism toward institutions.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Systemic Opacity:Secrecy around policing, surveillance, and policy fuels imagination.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Undenial Truth: Personal experience is irrefutsble in the face of denial and cover-ups.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Counter Forensics: Counter conspiracies are created to distract and discredit actual conspiracies.</strong> </li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p class="wide">The following books are by illumanti agents who snitch on themselves. Sometimes they follow a specific format to gain reader trust: 1. appearing as a truther 2. staging it as agenda free search for truth 3. claim they are not experts merely curious citizens 4. admit they are as vulnerable to manipulation as anyone else.</p>
