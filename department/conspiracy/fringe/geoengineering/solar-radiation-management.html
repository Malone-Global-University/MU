    <h2>What Is Solar Radiation Management?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Solar Radiation Management (SRM)</strong> refers to a family of proposed geoengineering techniques designed
      to reduce global temperatures by reflecting a portion of the Sun’s energy back into space. Unlike carbon-removal 
      strategies, which address the root cause of climate change, SRM focuses on managing the <em>symptoms</em> — 
      specifically, rising temperatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      SRM is controversial because, while it could theoretically cool the Earth rapidly, it does not reduce greenhouse gases 
      and may generate significant unintended consequences.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Main SRM Techniques</h2>

    <h3>Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)</h3>
    <p>
      This method proposes releasing reflective particles (often sulfate aerosols) into the stratosphere. The idea draws 
      inspiration from major volcanic eruptions that temporarily cool global temperatures. SAI is the most researched — 
      and the most controversial — SRM method.
    </p>

    <h3>Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB)</h3>
    <p>
      MCB involves spraying fine sea-salt particles into low-lying marine clouds to make them whiter and more reflective.
    </p>

    <h3>Cirrus Cloud Thinning</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike SAI and MCB, which aim to increase reflectivity, this method seeks to reduce the heat-trapping effects of thin 
      cirrus clouds by altering their formation.
    </p>

    <h3>Space-Based Reflectors</h3>
    <p>
      A hypothetical concept involving mirrors or reflective objects placed in orbit. While scientifically discussed, it 
      remains technologically unrealistic.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Scientific Motivation Behind SRM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SRM could reduce global temperatures rapidly — far faster than emissions cuts alone.</li>
      <li>It may help prevent “tipping points,” such as ice-sheet collapse or coral-reef die-off.</li>
      <li>Models show SRM could offset some effects of extreme warming while long-term mitigation continues.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      However, SRM does not address ocean acidification, and stopping SRM suddenly after long-term use could trigger rapid 
      “termination shock” warming.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Risks & Concerns</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Uneven regional impacts</strong> — cooling may favor some countries while harming others.</li>
      <li><strong>Uncertain climate side effects</strong> — rainfall patterns and monsoons could be altered.</li>
      <li><strong>Moral hazard</strong> — governments may reduce climate-mitigation efforts.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance gaps</strong> — no global treaty exists specifically for SRM.</li>
      <li><strong>Intergenerational dependence</strong> — once started, SRM may need to continue indefinitely.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>SRM in Conspiracy Culture</h2>
    <p>
      SRM is frequently connected to conspiracy topics because it involves highly technical atmospheric interventions and 
      resembles concepts seen in <strong>chemtrail</strong> narratives. Claims often include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Secret government weather-control programs.</li>
      <li>Undisclosed aerosol spraying by commercial aircraft.</li>
      <li>Population-control or military objectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In reality, SRM remains theoretical, with no confirmed deployment. Research is largely limited to computer modeling, 
      small-scale atmospheric studies, and governance policy discussions. No evidence exists of covert SRM operations.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      No country has authorized large-scale SRM deployment. A handful of proposed outdoor tests have been canceled or 
      suspended due to public concern, ethical debates, and regulatory uncertainty. Most major scientific organizations 
      advocate a cautious, highly regulated research approach — or a moratorium on outdoor experimentation.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Ethical & Governance Challenges</h2>
    <p>SRM raises serious questions about global decision-making:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who decides if SRM is deployed?</li>
      <li>How are affected nations consulted?</li>
      <li>What liability exists for harmful outcomes?</li>
      <li>How can deployment be monitored internationally?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Because SRM’s consequences would be global, scholars argue that international cooperation — not unilateral action — is 
      required before even small-scale field tests proceed.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Solar Radiation Management is one of the most debated areas of geoengineering. It offers the possibility of rapid 
      temperature reduction, yet carries uncertainty, political risk, and profound ethical questions. In both scientific 
      circles and conspiracy communities, SRM symbolizes humanity’s growing power — and responsibility — over Earth’s climate.
