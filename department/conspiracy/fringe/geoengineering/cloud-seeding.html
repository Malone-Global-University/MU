    <h2>What Is Cloud Seeding?</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique in which substances are dispersed into clouds to encourage precipitation.
      Most commonly, cloud seeding involves releasing:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Silver iodide</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Dry ice</strong> (solid carbon dioxide)</li>
      <li><strong>Salt particles</strong> (in warm-cloud seeding)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The goal is to make clouds produce rain, snow, or hail under controlled conditions. Cloud seeding is widely used for agriculture, water
      management, wildfire mitigation, and hail suppression.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>How Cloud Seeding Works: The Science</h2>
    <p>
      Clouds form when water vapor condenses around tiny particles (aerosols). In many cases, clouds contain moisture but do not form
      raindrops large enough to fall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cloud seeding <em>adds artificial particles</em> to accelerate condensation. These particles serve as “nuclei” that water vapor clings to,
      producing heavier droplets or ice crystals capable of falling as precipitation.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Methods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aircraft dispersal</strong> — planes release compounds directly into cloud systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Ground-based generators</strong> — burn silver iodide from mountaintops, allowing winds to carry it upward.</li>
      <li><strong>Rocket or artillery methods</strong> — used in China and Russia for hail suppression.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>History of Cloud Seeding</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud seeding began in the 1940s when Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir, working for General Electric, discovered that dry ice
      could trigger ice crystal formation in supercooled clouds.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Milestones</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1946:</strong> First successful artificial snowfall experiment over Mount Greylock.</li>
      <li><strong>1950s–60s:</strong> U.S. government launches Project Cirrus and other military weather modification experiments.</li>
      <li><strong>1967–72:</strong> Operation Popeye in Vietnam attempted to extend monsoon seasons to hinder troop movement.</li>
      <li><strong>2000s–2020s:</strong> Dozens of countries actively use cloud seeding for water management.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Controversies & Conspiracy Theories</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud seeding sits at a crossroads between atmospheric science and conspiracy culture. Because it is real, government-funded, and
      capable of influencing weather, it naturally attracts more speculative interpretations.
    </p>

    <h3>Major Public Concerns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Environmental impacts</strong> — long-term silver iodide accumulation remains debated.</li>
      <li><strong>Unintended weather effects</strong> — Does seeding one region “steal” rain from another?</li>
      <li><strong>Government transparency</strong> — Historically, some programs were classified or poorly disclosed.</li>
      <li><strong>Connection to “chemtrail” beliefs</strong> — some claim ordinary contrails are actually cloud seeding operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While cloud seeding is officially limited and localized, its existence fuels larger debates about weather control, environmental
      responsibility, and military applications.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Modern Global Use</h2>
    <p>Today, cloud seeding is used in more than 40 countries, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>United States (especially in the West)</li>
      <li>China (extensive national weather modification bureau)</li>
      <li>United Arab Emirates</li>
      <li>Russia</li>
      <li>Australia</li>
      <li>India</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Programs are primarily used to increase rainfall, enhance snowpack for water supplies, reduce hail damage, or clear skies during major events.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Is Cloud Seeding Effective?</h2>
    <p>
      Research suggests cloud seeding can increase precipitation by <strong>5% to 15%</strong> depending on cloud type and conditions. Results
      are often mixed, and scientists emphasize that cloud seeding cannot produce rain where no moisture exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a technique that <em>nudges</em> existing weather — not one that creates it from nothing.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Cloud Seeding and the Future of Weather Modification</h2>
    <p>
      As drought intensifies worldwide, cloud seeding is receiving renewed attention. Some see it as a necessary water-management tool. Others
      view it as the gateway to more ambitious geoengineering programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless, cloud seeding remains one of the few publicly acknowledged forms of weather control — sitting at the center of scientific,
      political, and conspiratorial debate.
