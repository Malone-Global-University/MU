    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP)</strong> is an ionospheric research facility near
        Gakona, Alaska. It uses a large phased array of high-frequency transmitters to temporarily energize small regions of
        the ionosphere so scientists can study how the upper atmosphere responds to controlled radio-frequency input.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section id="origins&development">
      <h2>Origins & Development</h2>
      <p>
        HAARP began in the 1990s with funding from the U.S. Air Force, DARPA, and other partners to support fundamental and
        applied radio-science research. Over time the array was expanded; experiments began in the late 1990s and continued
        into the 2000s.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section id="what-the-facility-does">
      <h2>What the Facility Does</h2>
      <p>
        The HAARP array is used to create a focused radio-frequency beam that can heat small volumes of the ionosphere.
        Researchers then observe the results with radars, receivers, and optical instruments. Studies include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic ionospheric physics (how charged particles and waves interact)</li>
        <li>Communications research (how the ionosphere affects radio signals)</li>
        <li>Space weather effects and diagnostic technique development</li>
        <li>Applied experiments, such as testing concepts for very low-frequency (VLF) communication using ionospheric modulation</li>
      </ul>
    </section>


    <section id="capabilities">
      <h2>Capabilities (limits matter)</h2>
      <p>
        HAARP’s antenna field can transmit a substantial radio-frequency signal into the ionosphere, but its effects are
        local, temporary, and orders of magnitude smaller than the natural energy inputs from the Sun and large-scale
        atmospheric systems. HAARP cannot inject energy on the scale required to create or steer hurricanes, large storms,
        or tectonic events.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section id="civilian-research">
      <h2>Transfer to Civilian Research & Recent Status</h2>
      <p>
        In 2015 operational control of the HAARP scientific instruments was transferred from the U.S. Air Force to the
        University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), which now manages the facility and makes it available for scientific use.
        The university has reopened and hosted experiments and public open houses in the years since, and the site has been
        used by academic and international researchers on a pay-for-use basis.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section id="why-haarp-attracts-conspiracy-theories">
      <h2>Why HAARP Attracts Conspiracy Theories</h2>
      <p>
        HAARP’s unique appearance—rows of antenna towers across a cleared field—and its military origins made it an easy
        target for speculation. Popular claims have included weather control, earthquake triggering, mind control, and other
        covert manipulation. Several features of the project helped those theories spread:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real military interest in ionospheric work (communications, surveillance) during the Cold War and later</li>
        <li>Classified or poorly publicized research in adjacent fields, which increased distrust</li>
        <li>Authors and activists promoting catastrophic interpretations without peer-reviewed evidence</li>
      </ul>
    </section>


    <section id="debunking">
      <h2>Scientific Consensus & Debunking</h2>
      <p>
        Independent experts and institutions emphasize that HAARP’s scientific experiments are narrowly targeted and that
        the facility lacks the energy and physical mechanism required to control large-scale weather or trigger earthquakes.
        Fact-checking organizations and space-science researchers have repeatedly shown that claims of weather or seismic
        manipulation by HAARP are not supported by evidence.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section id="approach">
      <h2>Malone University Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Our Conspiracy Studies department treats HAARP as a case study in how technical complexity, military secrecy, and
        striking visuals combine to generate persistent public myths. Students are encouraged to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read primary documentation and official facility materials</li>
        <li>Compare the scale of HAARP’s operations to natural atmospheric forces</li>
        <li>Analyze how media, advocacy, and historical secrecy shape perception</li>
        <li>Distinguish plausible scientific claims from speculative or unsupported assertions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="further-reading">
      <h2>Further Reading & Primary Sources</h2>
      <p>
        For primary information, see the HAARP site and UAF Geophysical Institute pages, plus contemporary science coverage
        and reliable fact-checks from major outlets.
