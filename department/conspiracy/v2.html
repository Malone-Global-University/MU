    <h2>Rumors and Realities: Key Examples</h2>
    <p>The following sections explore notable cases, categorized by their primary conspiracy type.</p>

    <h3>Political Suppression</h3>
    <p>Cases such as COINTELPRO, the surveillance of Malcolm X, and the deaths of Black leaders illustrate patterns of suppression justified as national security operations.</p>

    <h3>Economic & Corporate Exploitation</h3>
    <p>Corporate control over creative output—music catalogs, film rights, or invention patents—often fuels theories about ownership theft and exploitation.</p>

    <h3>Scientific, Medical & Technological</h3>
    <p>Historical malpractice, such as the Tuskegee Study and Henrietta Lacks, forms the factual basis for modern mistrust in medicine and science among African Americans.</p>

    <h3>Cultural & Psychological Manipulation</h3>
    <p>Media narratives and industry patterns influence identity formation and reinforce stereotypes, sometimes leading to suspicion of deliberate image control.</p>

    <h3>Esoteric, Spiritual & Fringe</h3>
    <p>From celebrity “Illuminati” myths to lost-tribe theories, these conspiracies often express deeper cultural anxieties and spiritual interpretations of power.</p>

    <h3>Cover-Up & Erasure</h3>
    <p>Lost records, suppressed archives, and erased histories—such as those surrounding Black Wall Street—represent the tangible side of conspiratorial silencing.</p>
