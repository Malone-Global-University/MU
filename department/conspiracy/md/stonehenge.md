Historical/Archaeological Claims

Stone circles like Stonehenge and Avebury correspond with Aryan/Phoenician arrival in Britain – Chronology is debated; mainstream archaeology dates Stonehenge’s main construction phases between 3000–1500 BC, before Phoenicians were in Britain.

Sumerian markings on Stonehenge stones – Claimed by L. A. Waddell; not widely accepted or verified by mainstream archaeology.

Ancients knew Pythagorean geometric principles before Pythagoras – Supported by Professor Alexander Thom’s studies on megalithic geometry and astronomical alignments.

Stonehenge as a gigantic astronomical observatory/clock – Well-supported; alignments with solstices and lunar extremes are documented.

Speculative / Conspiratorial Claims

Stonehenge as receiver/transmitter of energy – Based on ley lines and vortex theory; speculative and not verified scientifically.

Earth’s magnetic grid (Hartmann Grid) influencing sacred sites – Concept exists in pseudoscience; not scientifically confirmed.

Avebury, Silbury Hill, and other sites forming a “circuit board” of energy affecting Earth’s magnetic field – Highly speculative.

Crop formations linked to these energy points – Pseudoscientific interpretation; no verified causal link to megalithic sites.

Phoenician-Sumerian builders with advanced knowledge of astronomy, sacred geometry, and magnetic forces – Partially plausible for astronomy and geometry; magnetics and energy grid claims are speculative.

✅ Summary:

Supported: Astronomical alignments, megalithic geometry, historical dating of Stonehenge.

Speculative/controversial: energy transmission, ley lines, crop circles, Phoenician involvement in Britain.



Stonehenge & Avebury Cheat Sheet
1. Historical / Archaeological Facts
Claim	Notes / Verification
Stone circles (Stonehenge, Avebury) exist in Wiltshire, England	True, construction dates: ~3000–1500 BC for Stonehenge
Astronomical alignments (solstice/equinox, lunar extremes)	Verified; Stonehenge aligned to sunrise on summer solstice, sunset on winter solstice
Use of geometric patterns / early “Pythagorean” principles	Observed by Professor Alexander Thom; accepted in megalithic studies
Silbury Hill = largest human-made mound in Europe	True; construction ~2400–2300 BC
2. Speculative / Pseudoscientific Claims
Claim	Notes / Skepticism
Stone circles as energy receivers/transmitters	No empirical evidence; based on ley line theory
Earth’s magnetic grid (Hartmann Grid) influencing sites	Concept exists in pseudoscience; not confirmed scientifically
Avebury + surrounding sites = “circuit board” affecting Earth’s magnetic field	Speculative; no scientific support
Crop formations / “crop circles” linked to energy points	Unverified; considered human-made in most cases
Phoenician-Sumerian arrival / builders of British stone circles	Not supported by mainstream archaeology; chronological mismatch
3. Key Takeaways

Supported by evidence: astronomical alignments, megalithic engineering, geometric knowledge.

Controversial/speculative: energy grids, ley lines, mystical functions, Phoenician involvement.

Observation: The book frames these ancient sites as part of a global “energy grid” linked to ancient Aryan/Phoenician knowledge—this is interpretative, not factual.


Phoenician-Aryan Influence in Britain and Beyond
1. Stone Circles & Sacred Geometry

Stonehenge, Avebury, and other British stone circles built ~3,000 BC.

Built by Phoenician-Aryans with advanced knowledge of:

Astronomy, astrology, sacred geometry, mathematics

Earth’s magnetic field / energy grid

Claimed to function as energy receivers/transmitters; some stones allegedly “weightless” via sound/magnetic manipulation.

Avebury potentially mirrors the “Face on Mars” and Cydonia pyramids.

2. Mars Connection

Richard C. Hoagland: Cydonia pyramids & Face on Mars align with Martian solstice (~500,000 years ago).

Similar mathematics and sacred geometry used on Mars and Earth.

Claim: Ancient builders shared advanced knowledge across planets.

3. Symbolism & Religion
Symbol / Entity	Alleged Meaning / Connection
White horses (Uffington)	Phoenician Sun symbol
Red cross (St George, England)	Fire cross, Phoenician Sun symbol
Swastika	Phoenician Sun symbol, later Nazi adaptation
Lion	Sun, Aryan symbol, used at temples/sacred sites
Barati / Britannia / Diana / Brito-Martis	Phoenician goddess, linked across cultures (Cilicia → Britain → Egypt → Crete)
Nagas	Serpent gods; shape-shifting reptilian hybrids in Hindu legends
4. Linguistic & Cultural Claims

English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Gothic, Anglo-Saxon languages trace to Aryan Phoenician-Hittite-Sumerian roots.

Many English words (~50%) have Sumerian, Cyprian, or Hittite origin.

Ancient scripts across the Mediterranean (Cyprian, Hittite, Minoan, Phrygian, etc.) are local variations of a common Aryan writing system.

5. Historical / Genealogical Claims

Aryans/Phoenicians migrated from Caucasus → India, Europe, Britain.

Ancient ruling dynasties (Catti, Khatti) share same origin.

Integration of Aryan bloodlines and “reptile-Aryan” hybrids held positions of power historically and allegedly continue today.

6. Key Themes

Interconnection of ancient knowledge, power, and symbolism.

Cultural continuity: symbols, language, and religion traced across continents & millennia.

Esoteric knowledge suppressed: Christianity & official history allegedly erased or misrepresented advanced knowledge.
