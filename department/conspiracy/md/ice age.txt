### ❄️ Lesson: Where Did the Ice Come From?
#### 1. Desborough’s Alternative Theory

Researcher Brian Desborough proposed a dramatic explanation for the sudden appearance of polar ice and the frozen mammoths in Siberia:

- Venus as a Comet: In ancient times, Venus was not a planet but an enormous ice-covered comet that broke away from Jupiter.

- The Roche Limit: As it approached Earth, tidal forces stripped away its ice.

- Magnetised Ice Rain: The ice became ionised in Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts and was drawn to the poles by Earth’s magnetic field.

- Flash Freezing: Billions of tons of ice, nearly at absolute zero temperature, fell onto Earth, instantly freezing mammoths mid-meal.

- Polar Ice Sheets: The largest build-up happened at the poles, explaining why polar regions today have massive ice even though they receive little snowfall.

- Ancient Records: The Book of Job asks “Whence cometh the ice?” — Desborough saw this as evidence of cultural memory of the event.

- No Ice Age: Instead of slow glaciations, Earth originally had a tropical, water-canopy climate that was destroyed in this catastrophe.

#### 2. Mainstream Science Perspective

Conventional science gives a very different explanation:

- Planetary Origins: Venus is a rocky planet that formed 4.5 billion years ago, not a cometary fragment.

- Ice Ages: Geological and ice-core evidence show multiple ice ages over millions of years, caused by changes in Earth’s orbit, tilt, greenhouse gases, and feedback loops.

- Frozen Mammoths: Most paleontologists believe mammoths adapted to cold, grassy steppes. Some individuals were trapped in sudden climate shifts or mudslides, not frozen in an instant by extraterrestrial ice.

- Polar Ice: The ice caps grew over time from snowfall and compacted ice, not sudden deposits.

#### 3. Critical Thinking Questions

- Why do some researchers propose catastrophic explanations instead of gradual ones?

- What evidence would support Desborough’s Venus-Ice-Comet theory?

- What evidence strongly supports mainstream Ice Age science?

- Why might ancient myths and texts mention sudden ice, floods, or cosmic upheavals?

### ✨ Takeaway

Both perspectives highlight how humans try to explain mysteries in nature — whether through myth, catastrophe, or long-term scientific models. Studying alternative theories like Desborough’s helps us think critically about evidence, interpretation, and the stories we tell about Earth’s past.
