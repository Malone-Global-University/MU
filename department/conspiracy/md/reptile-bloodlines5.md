Watcher-Reptile Connection

The Watchers are associated with serpents, “fiery serpents,” or two-footed serpents.

Belial is described as a terrifying serpent-like figure, “Prince of Darkness,” linking the idea of evil to reptilian forms.

Physical Appearance of Hybrids

The Draco elite are said to be up to 12 feet tall, albino-white, “whiter than snow.”

The offspring of Watchers and humans (e.g., Noah) are described as giant, pale, blue-eyed, shining beings.

Reptilian-Human Lineage

Noah’s birth is interpreted as a reptile-human hybrid child.

Descendants of Noah could be linked to these hybrid bloodlines, implying a continuation of the “Watcher/Draco” genetics through human history.

Mythology & Symbolism

Eve and the serpent represent early hybridization or genetic manipulation by Watchers.

Gadreel, the fallen angel, is associated with the temptation of Eve—reinforcing the link between knowledge, manipulation, and hybrid lineage.

Suppression of Knowledge

The Book of Enoch was banned by the Roman Church to conceal human-Watcher interbreeding.

Secret societies (e.g., Freemasons) preserve and act upon this hidden knowledge.
