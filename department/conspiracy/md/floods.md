### üåä Lesson: Catastrophes of Venus, Mars, and Earth
#### 1. Desborough‚Äôs Catastrophic Scenario

According to Desborough (and earlier Velikovsky):

- Sudden Polar Climate Shift:
 When Venus passed close to Earth, polar regions froze instantly. Colliding with warmer air created devastating winds ‚Äî echoed in Chinese flood and wind legends.

- Massive Tidal Waves:
Venus‚Äôs orbit around Earth would have produced ocean waves as high as 10,000 feet.

-- Agriculture began on mountaintops because lowlands were submerged.

-- Plato wrote in Laws that farming restarted at high elevations after a global flood.

-- Botanist Nikolai Vavilov found crop origins in eight mountain regions, supporting this view.

- Mountains & Fossils:

-- Pressures from tidal waves (‚âà2 tons per square inch) could have raised new mountain ranges.

-- Rapid burial fossilized intact trees and animals in hours.

-- Fossils today do not form this way, suggesting they were the product of ancient cataclysms.

- Velikovsky‚Äôs Venus as a Comet:

-- In Worlds in Collision (1950), Velikovsky argued Venus was once a comet that destabilized Earth and Mars.

-- He suggested Venus collided with Mars around 1500 BC, causing massive disasters.

-- NASA‚Äôs Mariner missions later confirmed Venus has a thick atmosphere and odd tail-like structures, which Velikovsky cited as evidence.

- Mars in Turmoil:

-- Physicists claimed Mars was thrown into an unstable orbit, passing close to Earth every 56 years.

-- The last pass (~1500 BC) coincided with the eruption of Santorini, collapse of Minoan civilization, dropping sea levels, glacial lakes in California, and the drying of the Sahara.

-- Eventually, Mars stabilized, but its surface life was destroyed.

-- Mars Pathfinder (1997) found surface rocks that looked geologically ‚Äúyoung,‚Äù possibly supporting catastrophic resurfacing.

#### 2. Mainstream Science Perspective

- Flood Myths: Most cultures have flood myths, but geologists tie them to local floods, tsunamis, or post-Ice Age sea level rise ‚Äî not planet-wide tsunamis from Venus.

- Agricultural Origins: Crop domestication in highlands is explained by suitable soils, water, and climates, not necessarily by flood survival.

- Mountain Formation: Mountains form slowly by plate tectonics, not sudden water pressures. Fossils typically form by gradual sediment burial and mineralization.

- Mars: Orbital models and isotope dating show Mars has been stable for billions of years. Life evidence remains uncertain, but no planetary orbit shifts are needed to explain its geology.

- Velikovsky‚Äôs Claims: While some descriptions resembled later findings, most of Velikovsky‚Äôs physics (planetary collisions in human history) is inconsistent with celestial mechanics.

#### 3. Critical Thinking Questions

- Why do flood myths appear in so many cultures? Could they preserve memories of local disasters ‚Äî or of a global event?

- If Venus really passed near Earth, what physical evidence should we see in geology or astronomy today?

- How do gradualist and catastrophist models differ in explaining mountains, fossils, and deserts?

- Why do alternative theories like Velikovsky‚Äôs attract both fascination and controversy?

#### ‚ú® Takeaway

The catastrophic Venus-Mars scenario challenges mainstream science but offers a vivid lens to explore ancient myths, floods, and fossil mysteries. Whether accepted or not, it highlights how people interpret cosmic events, folklore, and geology in very different ways.
