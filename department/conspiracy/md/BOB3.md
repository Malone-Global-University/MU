Aryan & Reptile-Aryan Migration & Influence
1. Origin

Region: Caucasus Mountains (modern Russia, Georgia, Armenia)

Race: Aryan (“Arya”), with reptile-human hybrids among them

Expansion goal: Spread religion, language, and political influence

2. Southward Expansion

To India (~1550 BC):

Aryans introduced Sanskrit, the Vedas, and Sun-worship (Indra)

Connection to Hittite-Phoenician rulers (last Hittite king → first Aryan king of India)

To Near East (Sumer, Babylon, Egypt, Asia Minor):

Took same myths, religious stories, and Sun worship

Laid groundwork for world religions

3. Jewish Migration

Original homeland: Caucasus / Southern Russia, not Israel

Khazars: 8th-century mass conversion to Judaism

Migration path: Caucasus → Russia, Lithuania, Estonia → Western Europe → U.S.

Elite bloodline: Rothschild family, involved in creation of modern Israel

4. European Expansion

By sea: Phoenicians → Britain, Northern Europe

By land:

Cimmerians → Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark

Up Danube → Hungary, Austria → Southern Germany, France (Gauls/Keltoi/Celts)

Key conquests: Northern Italy, Central Europe, Asia Minor (Phrygia → Galatia)

5. Cultural & Religious Influence

Language & Myths: Recycled across continents

Religious symbols: Sun worship, Aryan myths embedded in local religions

Modern reflection: Many European elite bloodlines trace to this migration

6. Key Notes

Caucasus as origin explains the term “Caucasian”

Aryans acted as a coordinating elite network, laying foundations for later political and religious control

Spread of Phoenicians, Cimmerians, Scythians, Gauls/Celts is an ongoing theme in global influence
