### 👽 Lesson: Mars, Earth, and the Origins of Humanity
#### 1. Desborough’s Cosmic History

Brian Desborough proposed a striking vision of humanity’s origins, tied to planetary upheaval:

- Planetary Positions in the Past:

-- Earth once orbited closer to the Sun.

-- Mars orbited where Earth does now, making it warmer and more habitable.

-- Evidence: massive canyons on Mars (like Valles Marineris) could have been formed by flowing water.

- Early Human Races:

-- The first Earth humans were black races, their pigmentation suited to the stronger solar radiation closer to the Sun.

-- Ancient skeletons in Europe (near Stonehenge and France) allegedly show African features, suggesting migration or mixing.

- Martian Civilisation:

-- Mars had a white race with advanced technology.

-- They built pyramids (some claim pyramidal structures exist on Mars’s surface).

-- A great war broke out between Martians and Earth’s advanced black race — remembered in myths like the Hindu Vedas as wars of the gods.

- Stranded Martians:

-- After the Venus cataclysm devastated Mars, surviving white Martians stranded on Earth became the ancestors of today’s white races.

-- Evidence suggested: white people’s circadian rhythm in sensory deprivation sometimes aligns with Mars’s day (24h 40m) rather than Earth’s 24h cycle.

- Phoenicians / Aryans:

-- These Martian-descended peoples were remembered as Phoenicians or Aryans, credited as the “brains” behind Egyptian civilisation after 3000 BC.

-- The Giza Plateau was called El-Kahira — linked to El-Kahir, Arabic for Mars.

- Cultural Traces:

-- Ancient calendars (Ides of March, Oct. 26th in Celtic reckoning) show strong Mars associations.

-- Camelot of King Arthur legends is said to mean “City of Mars.”

#### 2. Mainstream Science Perspective

- Planetary Orbits: Earth and Mars have been in stable positions for billions of years. Mars has always been colder and drier than Earth, though it once had liquid water.

- Human Origins: Genetic and fossil evidence places humanity’s origin in Africa (≈200,000 years ago), with later migrations worldwide. No Martian ancestry is needed to explain racial diversity.

- Skeletons in Europe: African features can reflect migration patterns, not proof of Martian descent.

- Circadian Rhythms: While humans vary slightly in circadian timing, these are biological adaptations, not evidence of Martian lineage.

- Phoenicians: A seafaring people of the Levant (modern Lebanon), historically well-documented — no scientific evidence ties them to Mars.

- Mars Pyramids: NASA and ESA have imaged the “pyramids” and “face on Mars” in high resolution; they appear to be natural rock formations.

#### 3. Critical Thinking Questions

- Why do ancient myths often describe wars of the gods in the sky? Could these be allegories for natural disasters, or memories of real cosmic events?

- How can similarities in calendars, myths, and sacred sites be explained — cultural exchange, shared memory, or something more cosmic?

- Why might people connect racial origins with cosmic ancestry? What does this reveal about identity, myth, and science?

- How should we weigh symbolic evidence (myths, folklore) against physical evidence (genetics, fossils, planetary science)?

#### ✨ Takeaway

Desborough’s Martian theory reimagines human history as the product of cosmic migrations and wars between races of different planets. While unsupported by mainstream science, it provides a dramatic mythological framework to interpret ancient texts, legends, and mysteries of human origins.
