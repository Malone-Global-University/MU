ðŸŒŒ Module: Lower Fourth Dimensional Reptilian Control
1. Multidimensional Framework

Reality consists of multiple dimensions, like radio or TV frequencies, all operating simultaneously.

Humans normally perceive only the third dimension.

Some humans can tune their consciousness to other dimensions, connecting with information or entities operating on those frequencies (psychic abilities).

2. Lower Fourth Dimension

Reptilian control of Earth primarily originates from the lower fourth dimension (also called the lower astral plane).

This is the source of malevolent entities, historically called demons.

Modern Satanic rituals may summon lower fourth dimensional reptilians rather than literal supernatural beings.

Certain events, like nuclear tests in New Mexico (1940s), may have opened portals allowing these entities to interact with our dimension.

3. Mechanisms of Control

Reptilians manipulate humans via possession of specific bloodlines.

Hybrid human-reptile lines (from crossbreeding described in Sumerian texts and the Old Testament) are more susceptible to possession.

These lines evolved into European and British aristocracy, controlling politics, military, banking, media, and business worldwide.

4. Biological and Neurological Basis

Humans retain a reptile brain (R-complex), responsible for aggression, territoriality, ritualism, and social hierarchies.

Reptilian behaviors manifest in hybrid bloodlines and leadership structures.

Embryological development reflects evolutionary stages shared with reptiles, birds, and mammals (e.g., gills, tails).

5. Symbolism and Cultural Evidence

Vampire legends, like Count Dracula, symbolize Draco-linked bloodline control.

Chupacabra sightings reflect physical manifestations of reptilians.

Pheromones in humans chemically match those in reptiles, suggesting a genetic and biological connection.

Recognition of lower fourth dimensional influence challenges conventional perception of reality.

Discussion Questions

How does the concept of multidimensional existence change our understanding of extraterrestrial influence?

Can the R-complex in humans provide a biological explanation for hierarchical or ritualistic behaviors?

How do cultural symbols like vampires, dragons, and Chupacabras reflect reptilian influence?

What is the role of hybrid bloodlines in facilitating possession or control from other dimensions?
