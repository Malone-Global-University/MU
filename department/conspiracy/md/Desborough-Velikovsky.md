🌌 Module: Cosmic Catastrophes and Human Origins
Part 1 – Venus the Ice Comet

Alternative View (Desborough & physicists):

Venus was once a giant ice-coated comet, torn from Jupiter.

Passing near Earth, it shed billions of tons of ice at the Roche Limit.

Ionised ice fell at the poles, flash-freezing mammoths and creating polar ice sheets almost instantly.

Ancient texts like the Book of Job ask “Whence cometh the ice?” — possibly a memory of this cataclysm.

Earth before this event had a tropical “water canopy” climate, later destroyed.

Mainstream Science:

Venus is a rocky planet formed ~4.5 billion years ago, not a comet.

Mammoth freezing is explained by sudden local climate changes, not extraterrestrial ice.

Ice ages are supported by geology and ice cores, showing slow glacial cycles.

Critical Thinking Questions:

What kind of evidence would prove sudden, extraterrestrial ice-fall?

Why do many cultures have flood and freeze myths?

Part 2 – Floods, Tides, and Mars Upheaval

Alternative View:

Venus’s orbit around Earth caused 10,000-foot tidal waves.

Farming began at high altitudes because lowlands were flooded (Plato, Laws).

Botanist Nikolai Vavilov traced crops to 8 mountain regions, matching this pattern.

Tidal pressures fossilized entire trees in hours, explaining intact fossil finds.

Velikovsky (1950s) argued Venus was a comet that collided with Mars, disrupting Earth ~1500 BC.

Mars was thrown into a chaotic orbit, passing near Earth every 56 years, devastating both planets.

Mainstream Science:

Agriculture in mountain regions is explained by suitable soils and climates, not global floods.

Mountains and fossils form via tectonics and sedimentation over millions of years.

Mars has been in a stable orbit for billions of years, though it once had rivers and lakes.

Critical Thinking Questions:

How do myths of great floods (China, Mesopotamia, Bible, Mesoamerica) compare?

Can fossilization ever happen quickly? Under what conditions?

Part 3 – Humans of Earth and Mars

Alternative View:

Earth was once closer to the Sun → first Earth humans were black, adapted to intense sunlight.

Mars had a warmer climate → home to a white race, who built pyramids seen on Mars.

Great wars between Martians and Earth’s black race were remembered as the “wars of the gods” in texts like the Hindu Vedas.

After catastrophe, stranded Martians became the ancestors of white peoples.

Circadian rhythm tests: some white people show a ~24h 40m cycle, matching Mars’s day.

Martian descendants remembered as Phoenicians/Aryans, key to Egyptian civilisation.

Mainstream Science:

Human origins trace back to Africa ~200,000 years ago via fossils and genetics.

Mars does not show evidence of past advanced civilizations. “Pyramids” are natural formations.

Phoenicians were a Levantine seafaring culture, well-documented in archaeology.

Circadian rhythms vary naturally and don’t prove Martian ancestry.

Critical Thinking Questions:

Why do many myths speak of “wars of the gods” in the sky?

How do identity and myth shape alternative histories of race and civilisation?

Should myths be read as literal history, metaphor, or a mixture?

✨ Final Takeaway

This module explores how Desborough and Velikovsky reinterpreted ancient texts and scientific puzzles through catastrophism — the idea that sudden cosmic events reshaped planets, civilizations, and even human races.

Mainstream science supports a slower, evolutionary and geological process.
Both approaches show how humans try to connect cosmos, myth, and identity into a story of origins.
