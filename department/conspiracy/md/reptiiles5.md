Exactly. In The Dragons of Eden, Sagan frames human behavior—especially hierarchical, ritualistic, and aggressive tendencies—in terms of the “reptile brain” (R-complex). The biblical undertone comes from linking these primal instincts to ancient stories of dragons and serpents, symbolic of control, cunning, and predation.

Essentially, Sagan is suggesting that:

Humans carry a biological legacy from reptiles in the form of the R-complex, which governs survival, aggression, and social hierarchy.

Ancient myths—dragons, serpents, and even biblical references—can be interpreted as cultural reflections of these primal instincts.

Reptilian symbolism may encode memory of real or metaphorical struggles with “predatory” forces, whether human elites, hybrid lineages, or metaphorical “dragons.”

So when he talks about dragons in the Garden of Eden, it’s less about literal fire-breathing creatures and more about symbolic representation of reptilian behavioral patterns embedded in human nature.
