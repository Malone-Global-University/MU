üêç Module: The Reptilian Race & Global Serpent Symbolism
1. Core Claims (Alternative History / UFO Research)

The Anunnaki (from Sumerian tablets) may be genetically connected to white Martians, but are likely reptilian in origin.

Reptilian extraterrestrials have allegedly controlled Earth for thousands of years, influencing human societies and knowledge systems.

Modern researchers and witnesses report seeing humanoid reptiles:

Taller than humans, cold-blooded, highly intelligent.

Emotionally distant, difficulty expressing love.

Advanced technology.

This parallels the behavior of elite human groups described as the Brotherhood.

2. Ancient Symbolism

Ubaid Culture (5000‚Äì4000 BC, Iraq): Figurines of lizard-like gods holding lizard babies.

Mesoamerica: Quetzalcoatl, the winged serpent god.

Hopi: Plumed serpent god, Baholinkonga.

Native America: Serpent-shaped mound in Ohio, serpent imagery in myths.

India: Nagas, reptilian demons; literally ‚Äúthose who creep.‚Äù

Egypt: Serpent god Kneph; pharaohs pictured with serpents.

Phoenicia: Agathodemon, serpent deity.

Voodoo: Damballah Wedo, serpent god.

Hebrews: Nakhustan, the Brazen Serpent.

Britain: Dragon ruler ‚ÄúHU‚Äù ‚Üí possible origin of ‚ÄúHu-man.‚Äù

Sumerian winged-disc symbol: Often depicted with two serpents.

3. Connections to Modern Research

Dr. Arthur David Horn argues humanity was seeded by extraterrestrials and reptilian Anunnaki control continues.

Fred Hoyle (1971) suggested a global controlling force manifests in multiple forms, influencing humanity through the mind.

Jason Bishop III and other UFO researchers describe contemporary reptilian sightings consistent with ancient serpent gods.

4. Critical Discussion Points

Global Serpent Symbolism: Why do so many unrelated cultures depict serpent deities? Literal memory of extraterrestrials, metaphor, or archetype?

Reptilian Control Concept: What evidence exists for elite manipulation of societies historically and today? How does this parallel reptilian myths?

Ancient vs. Modern: Can figurines, myths, and modern UFO accounts be connected scientifically, or are they symbolic interpretations?

Myth and Identity: How do myths shape concepts of human origins, morality, and authority?

5. Suggested Student Activity

Symbol Mapping Exercise:

Students create a world map plotting serpent-related deities and myths.

Compare time periods and cultures.

Reflect: are patterns cultural coincidences, shared memory, or mythic archetypes?

Debate / Critical Essay:

Position A: Serpent myths reflect real extraterrestrial influence.

Position B: Serpent myths are symbolic, not literal, across cultures.
