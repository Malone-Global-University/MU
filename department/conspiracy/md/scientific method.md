1. Separate Observation from Interpretation

Observation: What was actually seen, recorded, or measured? Example: “Witness reported seeing human-like figures with lizard-like features.”

Interpretation: What the observer or author claims it means. Example: “This proves reptilian aliens control the elite.”
Tip: Treat observations as data; interpretations as hypotheses.

2. Look for Multiple Independent Sources

Confirm if multiple, unrelated observers report similar phenomena under different conditions.

Example: UFO sightings are more credible when multiple credible witnesses see the same event simultaneously.

Avoid single anecdotal claims as proof—they can be influenced by perception, memory, or suggestion.

3. Check the Context

Historical, cultural, or psychological context matters.

Could experiences be influenced by hallucinogens, hypnosis, trauma, or cultural myths?

Are there patterns across different cultures or eras? For example, “serpent gods” appear worldwide, but their meaning may vary.

4. Examine the Evidence

Physical evidence (artifacts, biological samples, recordings) is stronger than anecdote.

Evaluate whether the evidence can be replicated or independently verified.

Ask: Could there be alternative explanations grounded in known science?

5. Use Scientific Reasoning Without Dogma

Apply the principle of plausibility: a claim should not violate well-established scientific laws unless extremely strong evidence exists.

Keep track of which aspects are verified, speculative, or purely anecdotal.

Maintain a healthy skepticism: curiosity ≠ belief.

6. Track Predictions

The best hypotheses make testable predictions.

Example: If reptilian entities exist and influence events, what measurable effects would you expect? Can these be observed objectively?

7. Record and Reflect

Keep notes distinguishing facts, claims, and personal interpretation.

Reflect on your own biases: Are you seeing what you want to see, or what is supported by evidence?

8. Stay Open to Revision

Science evolves: today’s anomalies may become tomorrow’s discoveries (plate tectonics, meteorites, quantum phenomena).

Being open-minded means updating your beliefs when credible evidence emerges, not accepting all claims blindly.
