  <h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to Securities</h2>
<p class="wide">

Securities are financial instruments that represent ownership or debt and are traded on financial markets. These can be broadly classified into the following categories:</p>


<h3>1. Equity Securities (Stocks):</h3>

<p class="wide">
Represent ownership in a company.<br>
Shareholders are entitled to a portion of the companyâ€™s earnings (dividends) and may benefit from capital appreciation (stock price increase). <br>
Common stocks are the most typical form of equity security, but preferred stocks are another variant with different characteristics. </p>

<h3>2. Debt Securities (Bonds):</h3>

<p class="wide">
Represent a loan made by the investor to the issuer (government, corporation, etc.).<br>
Issuers agree to pay interest (coupon) periodically and repay the principal at maturity.<br> 
Bonds can be government (Treasuries), municipal (issued by local governments), or corporate (issued by companies). </p>


<h3>3. Derivatives:</h3>

<p class="wide">
Financial contracts whose value is derived from the performance of underlying assets, such as stocks, bonds, or market indexes. <br>
Common examples include options and futures contracts. <br>
They are used for hedging, speculation, or arbitrage. </p>

<h3>4. Investment Funds:</h3>

<p class="wide">
Pooled investments, like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), that allow investors to diversify by holding a basket of securities. <br>
Managed funds (actively managed or passively managed) invest in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities. </p>

<h3>5. Commodities:</h3>

<p class="wide">
Physical goods traded in markets such as oil, gold, or agricultural products. <br>
Commodities are also traded via futures contracts. </p>

<h2>Types of Trading:</h2>

<p class="wide">
1. Primary Market: This is where securities are created. When a company issues new stock or bonds, it raises capital in the primary market through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or bond issuance. </p>

<p class="wide">
2. Secondary Market: After securities are issued, they are traded between investors in the secondary market. This is where most of the activity occurs, typically through stock exchanges such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. </p>

<section id="concepts">
  <h2>  Key Trading Concepts</h2>

<p class="wide"><b>1. Bid Price vs. Ask Price:</b></p>

<p class="wide">
Bid Price: The price an investor is willing to pay for a security.<br>
Ask Price: The price at which a seller is willing to sell a security. <br>
The Spread is the difference between the bid and ask price, and it can be an indicator of market liquidity. </p>

<p class="wide"><b>2. Market Orders vs. Limit Orders:</b></p>

<p class="wide">
Market Order: A buy or sell order executed immediately at the best available price in the market. <br>
Limit Order: A buy or sell order placed at a specific price or better. It will only be executed when the market reaches the desired price. </p>

<p class="wide"><b>3. Volume:</b></p>

<p class="wide">
The total number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. <br>
High volume can indicate investor interest and liquidity, while low volume can signal lack of interest or liquidity. </p>

<p class="wide"> <b>4. Volatility:</b></p>

<p class="wide">
Refers to the degree of variation in the price of a security over time. <br>
High volatility means that the securityâ€™s price can change rapidly, while low volatility suggests that its price remains stable. </p>

<h3>Basic Trading Platforms:</h3>

<b>1. Brokerage Accounts:</b>
<p class="wide">
To trade securities, investors typically open brokerage accounts with firms like Schwab, Fidelity, or TD Ameritrade. These accounts allow you to buy and sell securities, as well as access market data and tools. </p>

<b>2. Order Types:</b>
<p class="wide">
Brokers offer various order types, such as market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders, to facilitate the execution of trades. </p>

<b>3. Stock Exchanges:</b>
<p class="wide">
Securities are often traded on stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. These exchanges provide a platform for buyers and sellers to transact. </p>
