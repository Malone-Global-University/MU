Great question. The key is that "overbought" and "oversold" are independent conditions based on momentum, not necessarily opposites that always occur together.
Here’s why:
1. Overbought ≠ Immediately Oversold
A stock can be overbought when its price has risen too fast relative to historical averages, meaning it's trading at an extreme level. 
However, it does not have to be immediately oversold right after—it can stay overbought for a long time if strong buying continues. 
2. Trends Can Stay Overbought for Extended Periods
In strong uptrends, a stock or index can remain overbought (RSI > 70) for weeks or months before cooling off. 
Example: A growth stock in a bull market can stay in overbought territory for an extended period without ever becoming oversold. 
3. Oversold Conditions Happen in Downtrends
A stock becomes oversold (RSI < 30) when selling pressure pushes it significantly below its average price range. 
But if buyers step in before it gets there, it might never become oversold even after being overbought. 
Example
Tesla (TSLA) rallies from $200 to $280 in two months. 
RSI reaches 85 → overbought condition. 
Instead of a deep sell-off, it consolidates around $270 for weeks. 
It never enters an oversold state because selling never intensifies enough. 
So, something can be overbought without being oversold because momentum indicators measure conditions separately, and markets can sustain strong buying or selling for extended periods.

Advanced Momentum Trading: How Traders Use RSI & Momentum Indicators
Since overbought and oversold conditions don’t always lead to immediate reversals, let’s explore how traders use momentum indicators like RSI in real-world trading strategies.
This lesson covers:
1. How RSI (Relative Strength Index) Works 
2. Using RSI for Trade Entries & Exits 
3. Divergences: Spotting Reversals Before They Happen 
4. Combining RSI with Other Indicators 

1. How RSI (Relative Strength Index) Works
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum oscillator that measures how fast a stock is moving relative to its past performance.
RSI Formula
RSI=100−1001+RSRSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}RSI=100−1+RS100​ 
Where RS (Relative Strength) = Average Gain / Average Loss over the last 14 periods (default setting).
Interpreting RSI Values
RSI Level
Market Condition
Meaning
Above 70
Overbought
Price has risen too fast—possible pullback or consolidation
Below 30
Oversold
Price has fallen too fast—potential for a bounce
Between 30-70
Neutral
No extreme conditions—trend continuation likely

2. Using RSI for Trade Entries & Exits
A. RSI Overbought & Oversold Trading Strategy
Buy when RSI < 30 (oversold) and price shows signs of bottoming. 
Sell when RSI > 70 (overbought) and price shows signs of slowing. 
✅ Example (Buying in Oversold Conditions)
Apple (AAPL) drops from $180 → $160, RSI hits 25. 
The price stabilizes and starts moving up → Buy signal. 
AAPL rallies back to $175, RSI moves above 50-60 → Exit trade. 
❌ Mistake: Shorting just because RSI is overbought—momentum can stay strong for a long time.
B. RSI Trend Confirmation Strategy
If RSI stays above 50 → the uptrend is strong, and dips are buying opportunities. 
If RSI stays below 50 → the downtrend is strong, and rallies are shorting opportunities. 
✅ Example (Using RSI for Trend Confirmation)
S&P 500 is in a strong bull market. RSI stays above 50 for weeks. 
Instead of selling when RSI touches 70, traders wait for RSI to fall back to 50-55 and buy the dip. 

3. RSI Divergences: Spotting Reversals Before They Happen
A divergence happens when price moves in one direction, but RSI moves in the opposite direction—a sign that momentum is weakening and a reversal may be near.
A. Bullish Divergence (Potential Uptrend Reversal)
Price makes lower lows, but RSI makes higher lows. 
This signals that selling pressure is weakening and a reversal may be coming. 
✅ Example (Bullish Divergence in Oversold Territory)
Tesla (TSLA) drops from $200 → $180 → $160, but RSI moves 30 → 35 → 40. 
Even though price is making new lows, RSI is moving higher → buy signal. 
TSLA rebounds to $180. 
B. Bearish Divergence (Potential Downtrend Reversal)
Price makes higher highs, but RSI makes lower highs. 
This signals that buying momentum is weakening, and a correction may follow. 
✅ Example (Bearish Divergence in Overbought Territory)
Amazon (AMZN) rallies from $120 → $140 → $150, but RSI moves 80 → 75 → 70. 
Even though price is rising, RSI is declining → warning of potential reversal. 
AMZN drops back to $135. 

4. Combining RSI with Other Indicators for Stronger Signals
RSI is powerful, but using it with other indicators improves accuracy.
A. RSI + Moving Averages (For Trend Confirmation)
If RSI is overbought (above 70), but price is above the 50-day moving average, wait before shorting. 
If RSI is oversold (below 30), but price is above the 200-day moving average, the long-term trend is still bullish. 
✅ Example (Avoiding a False Signal)
Netflix (NFLX) RSI = 75 (overbought), but price is above the 50-day EMA. 
Instead of shorting, traders wait for RSI to drop below 50 before considering a sell. 
B. RSI + Bollinger Bands (For Spotting Reversals)
Overbought RSI + Price at Upper Bollinger Band → High chance of pullback. 
Oversold RSI + Price at Lower Bollinger Band → High chance of bounce. 
✅ Example (Spotting a Sell Opportunity)
NVIDIA (NVDA) RSI = 78 (overbought), and price is at the top of Bollinger Bands. 
Traders expect a pullback and enter a short position. 

Key Takeaways
Overbought does not always mean “sell immediately.” Stocks can stay overbought for a long time in strong trends. 
RSI below 30 = potential buying opportunity, RSI above 70 = potential selling opportunity. 
Divergences between RSI & price signal reversals. 
Combine RSI with moving averages, Bollinger Bands, or MACD for stronger signals.
