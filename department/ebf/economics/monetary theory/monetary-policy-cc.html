    <h1>Medium of Exchange – Brief Intro for busy people</h1>

<h1>Monetary Theory Crash Course (2.5 Min Each)</h1>

<li><a href="departments/political-economy.html">1. Functions and Nature of Money</a></li>

<h2>Money plays four vital roles:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Medium of Exchange: It enables trade by eliminating the inefficiencies of barter.</li>
<li>Unit of Account: It provides a common standard to measure and compare values.</li>
<li>Store of Value: It preserves purchasing power over time, assuming low inflation.</li>
<li>Standard of Deferred Payment: Contracts and loans use money to settle future obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Types of money:
Fiat Money: Government-issued, not backed by physical commodities (e.g., USD).
Commodity Money: Has intrinsic value (e.g., gold, silver).
Digital/Crypto Money: Exists electronically. Crypto (e.g., Bitcoin) relies on decentralized ledgers.
</p>

2. Money Supply and Demand
Money supply is controlled by central banks via tools like reserve requirements, interest rates, and open market operations.
Velocity of Money: Frequency of money exchanges in an economy.
Quantity Theory of Money (MV = PY): M = Money supply, V = Velocity, P = Price level, Y = Output.
Monetarism (Friedman): Inflation is always a monetary phenomenon; stable growth in money supply avoids shocks.
Keynesian Liquidity Preference: People demand money for transactions, precaution, and speculation.

3. Inflation and Deflation
Inflation: General price increase. Demand-pull (too much demand) vs. Cost-push (rising costs).
Hyperinflation: Runaway inflation; destroys currency trust (e.g., Zimbabwe, 2000s).
Inflation Targeting: Central banks aim for stable rates (usually ~2%).
Deflation: General price decline; can trap economies (e.g., Japan, 1990s).

4. Interest Rates
Nominal: Advertised rate. Real: Adjusted for inflation.
Loanable Funds Theory: Interest = supply & demand for saving/investment.
Liquidity Preference (Keynes): People prefer liquid assets. Interest is the "price" of parting with liquidity.
Central Bank Tools: Open market operations, discount rates, and reserve requirements affect interest levels.

5. Monetary Policy
Expansionary: Lowers rates, increases money to stimulate growth.
Contractionary: Raises rates, tightens supply to curb inflation.
Rules vs. Discretion: Should central banks follow preset rules (e.g., Taylor Rule) or adapt?
Transmission Mechanism: How policy affects lending, spending, output, and inflation.

6. Money and Banking System
Fractional Reserve Banking: Banks lend part of deposits, creating money.
Central Banks: Regulate money, stabilize economy, act as lender of last resort.
Shadow Banking: Non-bank intermediaries (e.g., hedge funds) outside regulations.
Monetary Aggregates: M0 (cash), M1 (cash + checking), M2 (M1 + savings + short-term deposits).

7. Exchange Rates & Int’l Monetary Systems
Fixed: Pegged to another currency. Floating: Market-determined.
Balance of Payments: Records all international transactions; deficits can trigger crises.
Gold Standard: Currencies backed by gold. Bretton Woods: Post-WWII peg to USD.
PPP: Prices should equalize across borders. Interest Rate Parity: Capital flows adjust to interest differences.

8. Expectations & Policy Credibility
Rational Expectations: Agents forecast policy effects accurately.
Adaptive Expectations: People base future on past trends.
Credibility: Belief in central bank policy ensures effectiveness.
Time Inconsistency Problem: Gov'ts may promise low inflation but renege under pressure (Kydland & Prescott).

9. Unconventional Monetary Policy
QE: Central bank buys assets to inject liquidity.
Negative Rates: Penalize holding money to encourage spending.
Forward Guidance: Signaling future policy to shape expectations.
MMT: Gov'ts can print money to fund spending if inflation is managed.
CBDCs: Central Bank Digital Currencies offer programmable, official digital cash.

10. Theories of Money and Output
Classical Dichotomy: Real economy separate from nominal (money) side.
Neutrality of Money: In the long run, money doesn't affect real output.
Phillips Curve: Tradeoff between inflation and unemployment (short run).
IS-LM/AD-AS: IS-LM shows money vs. goods market. AD-AS captures inflation and output dynamics.
