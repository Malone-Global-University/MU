      <h2>Step-by-Step Explanation of Baking Methods</h2>

      <ol>

        <li>
          <strong>Creaming Method</strong>
          <p>Used for cakes, cookies, and many desserts. Creaming combines butter and sugar to create air bubbles that expand during baking.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Beat room-temperature butter with sugar.</li>
            <li>Mix until pale, light, and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add eggs gradually to maintain the emulsion.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Kneading Method</strong>
          <p>Used for yeast doughs (bread, rolls, pizza). Kneading develops gluten, giving dough elasticity and strength.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Push dough away with the heel of your hand.</li>
            <li>Fold it back over itself.</li>
            <li>Repeat until the dough becomes smooth and stretchy.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Beating Method</strong>
          <p>Used to create aeration in mixtures such as batters or frostings.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vigorously mix ingredients to incorporate air.</li>
            <li>Common tools: stand mixer, hand mixer, whisk.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Folding Method</strong>
          <p>Used for delicate batters like soufflés, mousse, and some cakes. Folding prevents deflation.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a spatula to lift batter from bottom to top.</li>
            <li>Rotate the bowl as you fold.</li>
            <li>Stop when dry ingredients disappear; avoid over-mixing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Whisking / Foam Method</strong>
          <p>Used for sponge cakes, angel food cakes, and meringues. Whipping eggs or cream incorporates air for volume.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use clean, grease-free bowls.</li>
            <li>Whip until desired peak stage (soft, medium, firm).</li>
            <li>Fold gently into dry ingredients.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Rubbing-In Method</strong>
          <p>Used for biscuits, pie crusts, and scones. Cold fat is rubbed into flour to create flakiness.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use cold butter or shortening.</li>
            <li>Rub between fingertips until texture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Avoid warming the fat; temperature is crucial.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Melting Method</strong>
          <p>Used in brownies, gingerbreads, and some simple cakes. Fats are melted before combining with dry ingredients.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Melt fat (butter/oil) gently.</li>
            <li>Mix with sugar and liquids.</li>
            <li>Add dry ingredients last.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ol>

    <!-- ======================= NOTES & TIPS ======================= -->
    <section>
      <h2>Notes & Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Different methods create different textures — understanding them is key to recipe mastery.</li>
        <li>Temperature matters: cold for rubbing-in; room-temp for creaming; warm for yeast doughs.</li>
        <li>Avoid over-mixing after flour is added unless you are intentionally developing gluten.</li>
        <li>When in doubt, follow the method named in the recipe — it determines structure.</li>
      </ul>
