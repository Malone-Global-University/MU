      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the definition of baking.</li>
        <li>Recognize the key differences between baking and cooking.</li>
        <li>Identify common baking ingredients and their roles.</li>
        <li>Gain awareness of the importance of precision in measurements and timing.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Read about the history and evolution of baking to understand its cultural significance.</li>
        <li>Learn the main types of baked goods: bread, pastries, cakes, and cookies.</li>
        <li>Identify the role of ingredients:
          <ul>
            <li>Flour: structure</li>
            <li>Sugar: sweetness and browning</li>
            <li>Leavening agents: rising</li>
            <li>Fats: texture and flavor</li>
            <li>Liquids: moisture and cohesion</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Compare baking with cooking:
          <ul>
            <li>Baking uses dry heat, often in an oven, while cooking can involve various methods like boiling or frying.</li>
            <li>Baking requires precise measurements and timing, whereas cooking is often more flexible.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Review basic baking terminology, such as kneading, proofing, creaming, and folding.</li>
        <li>Practice reading and interpreting simple baking recipes to recognize measurement conventions and techniques.</li>
      </ol>
