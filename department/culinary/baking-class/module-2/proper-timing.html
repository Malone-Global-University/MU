    <section aria-labelledby="overview">
      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>Proper timing is critical for scoring success. This lesson explains when to score relative to proof, cold retardation, and oven entry — and how timing interacts with steam to determine oven spring, ear formation, and final texture.</p>
      <p><strong>Learning objectives:</strong> Learn to evaluate proof readiness, choose the correct moment to score, handle cold-proofed dough, and coordinate scoring with steam and oven entry.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="proof-checks">
      <h2 id="proof-checks">Proof checks — decide if the dough is ready</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Poke test:</strong> Gently press with an oiled finger ~1 cm into the dough:
          <ul>
            <li>Springs back immediately = underproofed (wait).</li>
            <li>Springs back slowly and partially = ideal (score and bake).</li>
            <li>Leaves an indentation or collapses = overproofed (handle carefully; shallow scoring or cold bake may help).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Visual cues:</strong> Dough should look slightly rounded, with visible surface tension. Overproofed dough often looks loose and flat.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing by recipe:</strong> Use recipe proof windows as guides — but always confirm with poke test because ambient conditions change proof speed.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="when-to-score">
      <h2 id="when-to-score">When to score — practical rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Score immediately before oven entry:</strong> Scoring too early allows the cut to seal and the edge to dry, reducing oven spring. Aim to score within 1–2 minutes of placing the loaf in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold-proof (retarded) dough:</strong> Score directly from the refrigerator for many styles — chilled dough is firmer and gives cleaner cuts. If using chilled loaves, preheat oven fully and transfer quickly to avoid warming the dough surface too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Room-temperature proofed dough:</strong> Score at bench and move immediately to the oven. If you must wait, keep covered and lightly floured; re-flour blade if it sticks.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple loaves handling:</strong> Stagger scoring and baking so each loaf is scored just before it goes into the oven. Work in a production line: score → place on peel → transfer to oven.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="timing-steam">
      <h2 id="timing-steam">Timing scoring with steam and oven conditions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Steam window:</strong> Steam is most effective in the first 8–12 minutes of baking. Ensure your scoring is done immediately before oven entry so the steam interacts with a fresh cut.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheated oven:</strong> Always score when oven is fully preheated. A cold oven reduces oven spring and can collapse loaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Score with the intention of how steam will shape the ear — too much steam with a shallow cut may reduce ear lift; moderate steam with a low-angle, slightly deeper cut creates a crisp ear.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="cold-proofing">
      <h2 id="cold-proofing">Scoring from cold proof (best practices)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Keep loaves covered:</strong> When removing from fridge, keep loaves on parchment or transfer carefully — avoid sudden handling that collapses structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring technique:</strong> Use a very sharp blade and confident single motion. Because the dough is firm, you may need slightly less depth (3–8 mm depending on dough).</li>
        <li><strong>Heat shock:</strong> For maximum ear, place chilled loaf into a very hot oven; the sudden heat and steam help create a strong ear. For delicate dough, allow 10–15 minutes of tempering at room temperature if pastry integrity is at risk.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="delays-and-rescues">
      <h2 id="delays &amp; rescues">Delays, rescues &amp; troubleshooting</h2>
      <h3>If you must delay after scoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lightly cover scored loaves with a clean damp towel or parchment to slow drying — this is a temporary fix and not ideal.</li>
        <li>If the surface dries and the cut seals, re-flour the blade and re-score quickly and confidently before baking.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Overproofed loaves</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Shallow, multiple small cuts can encourage controlled expansion without collapse.</li>
        <li>Consider an immediate bake with reduced steam to avoid excessive oven spring that causes collapse; or very shallow scoring and a gentle bake if crumb tolerance is low.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Underproofed loaves</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Underproofed dough may resist opening — avoid very deep cuts; instead allow a brief final bench rest (10–20 minutes) if time allows, then score and bake.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="step-by-step">
      <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-step checklist</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Confirm proof with poke test and visual cues.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven fully and prepare steam (tray, steam injector, or dutch oven).</li>
        <li>If cold-proofed, move loaves from fridge onto peel briefly; keep covered until scoring.</li>
        <li>Score each loaf confidently within 1–2 minutes of oven entry.</li>
        <li>Place loaf into oven, add steam immediately (first 8–12 minutes critical).</li>
        <li>Observe oven spring and adjust timing/depth in subsequent bakes based on results.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="practice-assessment">
      <h2 id="practice-assessment">Practice exercises &amp; assessment</h2>
      <h3>Exercises</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Timed sequence: proof 6 small batards and practice scoring and loading them into the oven with 30-second spacing — aim to score each loaf within 90 seconds of its oven entry.</li>
        <li>Cold vs. room: cold-proof 3 loaves and room-proof 3 loaves; score appropriately and compare ear, crust and crumb.</li>
        <li>Steam timing: bake identical loaves with steam applied immediately, delayed by 5 minutes, and no steam — observe differences.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Assessment rubric (suggested)</h3>
