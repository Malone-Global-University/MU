        <h2 id="what-gluten-is">What Gluten Is</h2>
        <p class="wide">
          Gluten is a network of proteins found in wheat and some related grains (for example, barley and rye)
          that gives dough its elasticity and structure. It’s composed mainly of two protein groups:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gliadin</strong> – provides dough <em>stretchability</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Glutenin</strong> – provides dough <em>strength and elasticity</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="wide">
          When combined with water and mechanical action (mixing/kneading), these proteins form a network that traps gases
          produced by yeast, allowing bread to rise and hold its shape.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="how-gluten-forms">How Gluten Forms</h2>
        <p class="wide">Gluten formation is a physical and biochemical process that happens in stages:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Hydration</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              When flour mixes with water, gliadin and glutenin absorb water and unfold, enabling bonds to form between proteins.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Kneading / Mixing</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Mechanical action aligns and links protein strands to build an elastic network. Proper kneading develops dough that can stretch without tearing.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Resting / Autolyse</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Rest periods let water penetrate flour fully, improving gluten formation and dough extensibility.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Fermentation</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Yeast produces gases that expand the gluten network; gluten traps the gas and gives the loaf its volume and structure.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Key Points to Remember</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Gluten forms only after hydration and mechanical action. Over-kneading can tighten the dough excessively; under-kneading leaves it weak.
              Salt strengthens gluten while fats and high sugar can shorten or soften it.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="sugar-and-gluten">How Sugar Affects Gluten</h2>
        <p class="wide">
          Sugar interacts with gluten in several ways—particularly in enriched doughs such as brioche or sweet rolls.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Competes for Water (Hydration Competition)</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Sugar is hygroscopic and draws water away from proteins, slowing gluten development when sugar levels are high.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Softens the Gluten Network</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              By reducing free water for protein bonding, sugar makes dough softer and more extensible, producing a tender crumb.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Fermentation Effects</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Moderate sugar feeds yeast and speeds fermentation; excessive sugar creates osmotic stress that can slow yeast activity.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Crumb and Structure Impact</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              High-sugar doughs have weaker gluten and a softer crumb. Bakers often compensate with stronger flour or longer development.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Small sugar amounts: minimal effect.</li>
              <li>Moderate sugar: softer, tender breads.</li>
              <li>High sugar: very soft, sticky doughs that require special handling.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="salt-and-gluten">How Salt Affects Gluten</h2>
        <p class="wide">Salt acts like a coach for gluten: it tightens, stabilizes, and improves dough behavior and flavor.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Strengthens the Gluten Network</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Salt strengthens protein bonds and makes dough more elastic and resilient.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Controls Dough Extensibility</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Salt reduces excessive slackness and helps the dough hold its shape during fermentation and shaping.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Regulates Yeast Activity</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Salt slows fermentation, which improves flavor development and reduces the risk of over-proofing.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Enhances Flavor and Crust</h3>
            <p class="wide">
              Salt improves taste and contributes to crust color during baking.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2 id="gluten-effects-on-bread">How Gluten Affects Dough & the Finished Product</h2>

        <h3>Dough Elasticity & Strength</h3>
        <p class="wide">Gluten provides elasticity so dough can stretch and retain shape during proofing and baking.</p>

        <h3>Gas Retention & Rise</h3>
        <p class="wide">Gluten traps CO₂ from yeast, allowing proper rise and an open crumb structure when developed correctly.</p>

        <h3>Texture & Chew</h3>
        <p class="wide">Strong gluten = chewy, structured breads; weak gluten = tender, soft products.</p>

        <h3>Crumb Structure</h3>
        <p class="wide">Well-developed gluten → even crumb with defined air pockets; underdeveloped → dense/gummy crumb.</p>

        <h3>Shape & Volume</h3>
        <p class="wide">Gluten helps dough hold shape; without adequate gluten, loaves may spread or collapse.</p>

        <h3>Interaction with Ingredients</h3>
        <p class="wide">Fats, sugars, bran, and germ all influence gluten development and final texture—adjust hydration and development time accordingly.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="health-effects">Health Effects of Gluten</h2>

        <h3>General Population</h3>
        <p class="wide">
          For most people, gluten is safe and contributes to the structure of baked goods. Whole-grain wheat products also supply fiber, vitamins, minerals, and protein.
        </p>

        <h3>Celiac Disease</h3>
        <p class="wide">
          Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which ingestion of gluten damages the small intestine. People with celiac disease must follow a strict gluten-free diet under medical supervision.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS)</h3>
        <p class="wide">
          Some people experience gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms after eating gluten without celiac disease. Symptoms often improve on a gluten-restricted diet, although intestinal damage is not present as in celiac disease.
        </p>

        <h3>Wheat Allergy</h3>
        <p class="wide">
          A wheat allergy is an immune response to proteins in wheat (which may include gluten). Symptoms range from mild (hives) to severe (anaphylaxis).
        </p>

        <h3>Potential Misconceptions</h3>
        <p class="wide">
          Gluten is not inherently unhealthy for people without sensitivity or allergy. Some processed gluten-free products are lower in fiber and micronutrients than comparable whole-grain products.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="germ-and-gluten">The Germ & Gluten</h2>

        <h3>What the Germ Is</h3>
        <p class="wide">The germ is the nutrient-rich part of the wheat kernel (vitamins, minerals, healthy fats); gluten-forming proteins are concentrated in the endosperm.</p>

        <h3>How the Germ Affects Gluten</h3>
        <p class="wide">Germ and bran introduce oils and sharp particles that can interfere with gluten continuity, so whole-grain dough commonly needs more hydration and development time.</p>

        <h3>Practical Implication</h3>
        <p class="wide">
          Whole wheat flour may require higher hydration, autolyse, or preferments to achieve comparable loaf volume and open crumb.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="protein-types">Protein Types in Wheat</h2>
        <p class="wide">
          In addition to gluten (gliadin & glutenin), wheat contains other proteins that contribute nutrition rather than structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Albumins</strong> — water-soluble, digestible proteins.</li>
          <li><strong>Globulins</strong> — salt-soluble proteins with nutritional roles.</li>
          <li><strong>Enzymes & minor proteins</strong> — from germ/bran, can influence fermentation.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="practical-takeaway">Practical Takeaway</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>For structure:</strong> white flour gives stronger gluten → lighter, airier loaves.</li>
          <li><strong>For nutrition:</strong> whole wheat offers more total protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals → denser, chewier loaves.</li>
        </ul>
