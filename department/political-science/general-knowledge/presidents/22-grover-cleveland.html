<h2>üü¢ The Good ‚Äì The Honest Reformer and Fiscal Conservative</h2>

<h3>Honest and Principled Leadership</h3>
<p>
	Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th U.S. President (1885‚Äì1889 and 1893‚Äì1897), was known for his integrity and refusal to engage in political corruption. He earned the nickname ‚ÄúGrover the Good‚Äù for fighting patronage and prioritizing merit over favoritism.
</p>
<h3>Civil Service Reform Advocate</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland supported merit-based appointments and opposed the spoils system, continuing the reform efforts of predecessors like Rutherford B. Hayes and Chester A. Arthur.
</p>
<h3>Fiscal Conservatism</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland was a strict fiscal conservative, opposing unnecessary government spending and championing sound money policies, including maintaining the gold standard. He vetoed excessive pension bills for Civil War veterans to prevent waste.
</p>
<h3>Strong Use of Presidential Authority</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland actively used his veto power to check Congress when he believed bills were improper, demonstrating independence and a commitment to principle over party.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>üîµ The Bad ‚Äì The Inflexible and Controversial</h2>

<h3>Veto Power Controversy</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland‚Äôs frequent vetoes earned him criticism, especially from veterans and political allies. Many saw him as stubborn or uncompromising, prioritizing principle over political pragmatism.
</p>
<h3>Labor and Economic Policy Criticism</h3>
<p>
	During his second term, Cleveland‚Äôs response to the Panic of 1893 was widely criticized. His commitment to the gold standard and opposition to inflationary measures alienated labor groups and farmers who wanted economic relief.
</p>
<h3>Limited Social Reform</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland prioritized fiscal responsibility over social progress, leaving reformers frustrated. He did little to address poverty, inequality, or labor unrest during his terms.
</p>
<h3>Alienation of Political Allies</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland‚Äôs independence often angered both Democrats and Republicans, weakening his political support. His refusal to reward supporters through patronage created enemies within his own party.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>üî¥ The Ugly ‚Äì Economic Turmoil and National Strife</h2>

<h3>Panic of 1893</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland‚Äôs second term coincided with one of the worst economic depressions in U.S. history. Unemployment soared, businesses failed, and public unrest grew. His adherence to fiscal orthodoxy limited the government‚Äôs ability to respond effectively.
</p>
<h3>Pullman Strike and Labor Conflict</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland federalized troops to break the Pullman Strike (1894), siding with business over labor. This decision angered workers and intensified class tensions, highlighting the limits of his political judgment.
</p>
<h3>Political Isolation</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland‚Äôs rigid independence, combined with economic and labor crises, left him politically isolated during his second term. Historians often see this period as one of unfulfilled potential and mounting national challenges.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
Grover Cleveland was an honest, principled president whose good lay in reform, fiscal conservatism, and independence from political corruption. His bad was stubborn inflexibility and alienation of allies; his ugly was the economic turmoil and labor conflict of his second term. Cleveland illustrates the tension between moral principle and practical governance during periods of national crisis.
