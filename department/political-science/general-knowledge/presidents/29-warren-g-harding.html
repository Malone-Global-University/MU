<h2>üü¢ The Good ‚Äì The Popular and Reassuring Leader</h2>

<h3>Return to ‚ÄúNormalcy‚Äù</h3>
<p>
	Warren G. Harding, the 29th U.S. President (1921‚Äì1923), was elected on a platform of ‚Äúreturn to normalcy‚Äù following World War I and the upheaval of the Wilson administration. He restored a sense of stability and calm to a nation fatigued by war and progressive reform turmoil.
</p>
<h3>Economic Policies</h3>
<p>
	Harding promoted pro-business policies, including tax cuts and reduced government spending, aiming to stimulate post-war economic growth and encourage private enterprise.
</p>
<h3>Advocate for Veterans</h3>
<p>
	He supported veterans‚Äô benefits and initiatives to help former soldiers reintegrate into civilian life, responding to widespread post-war needs.
</p>
<h3>Civil Rights Attention (Limited)</h3>
<p>
	Harding spoke out against lynching and racial violence, advocating for civil rights in rhetoric and some policy discussions, though implementation was minimal.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>üîµ The Bad ‚Äì Ineffective Leadership and Delegation</h2>

<h3>Reliance on Cronies</h3>
<p>
	Harding delegated heavily to friends and political allies, known as the ‚ÄúOhio Gang‚Äù, some of whom were corrupt. His personal trust in friends often blinded him to their unethical practices.
</p>
<h3>Limited Policy Vision</h3>
<p>
	Harding‚Äôs presidency lacked bold legislative achievements beyond economic measures. He avoided controversial issues and often deferred to Congress or advisors.
</p>
<h3>Health and Overwork</h3>
<p>
	Harding‚Äôs declining health contributed to his early death in office. While popular and charming, he lacked the stamina to fully manage the presidency or curb corruption in his administration.
</p>
<h3>Unrealized Civil Rights Efforts</h3>
<p>
	Although he spoke against racial injustice, Harding‚Äôs limited actions failed to produce systemic change for African Americans or address widespread discrimination.
</p>

<section>
<h2>üî¥ The Ugly ‚Äì Scandals and Legacy Tarnish</h2>

<h3>Teapot Dome and Other Scandals</h3>
<p>
	Harding‚Äôs administration was plagued by corruption, the most infamous being the Teapot Dome scandal, involving bribery and misuse of federal oil reserves. Many associates engaged in unethical or illegal activities.
</p>
<h3>Death and Historical Reputation</h3>
<p>
	Harding died suddenly in 1923, preventing accountability and leaving historians to judge his presidency largely by the scandals of his appointees. His reputation suffered, ranking him among the least effective presidents in many surveys.
</p>
<h3>Overshadowed by Successors</h3>
<p>
	Harding‚Äôs early death and administration corruption allowed successors like Calvin Coolidge to shape the 1920s narrative, leaving Harding as a cautionary tale of weak oversight and misplaced trust.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Warren G. Harding was a charming and popular president whose good lay in restoring post-war stability, promoting economic growth, and offering moderate support for civil rights. His bad was weak leadership and overreliance on cronies; his ugly was the corruption of his administration, particularly the Teapot Dome scandal, which severely tarnished his historical legacy. Harding illustrates the danger of personal popularity without strong oversight in the executive branch.</p>
