<h2>🟢 The Good – The Legislative Advocate and Nationalist</h2>

<h3>Veteran and Public Servant</h3>
<p>
	Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd U.S. President (1889–1893), was a Union Army officer during the Civil War and later served as a U.S. Senator from Indiana. His military and political background lent him credibility and experience in governance.
</p>
<h3>Support for Protective Tariffs</h3>
<p>
	Harrison championed the McKinley Tariff (1890), designed to protect American industries and encourage economic growth. He believed in fostering domestic manufacturing to strengthen the nation’s economy.
</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Navy</h3>
<p>
	Harrison oversaw significant expansion of the U.S. Navy, preparing the country for future global influence. This modernization contributed to the eventual rise of the United States as a world power.
</p>
<h3>Commitment to Veterans</h3>
<p>
	Harrison advocated for veterans’ pensions, particularly for Union soldiers of the Civil War, fulfilling promises to those who had served the nation and supporting their welfare.
</p>

<section>
	<h2>🔵 The Bad – Economic Missteps and Political Vulnerability</h2>

<h3>McKinley Tariff Backlash</h3>
<p>
	While protective in intent, the McKinley Tariff raised consumer prices and angered farmers, leading to widespread dissatisfaction and contributing to the Democratic victory in the 1890 midterm elections.
</p>
<h3>Limited Domestic Achievements</h3>
<p>
	Harrison’s administration focused heavily on tariffs, foreign affairs, and military issues, but produced few substantive reforms in social policy, civil rights, or labor protection.
</p>
<h3>Political Vulnerability</h3>
<p>
	Harrison faced a divided Republican Party and struggled to maintain broad support. His inability to balance party factions weakened his political effectiveness and left him vulnerable in the 1892 election.
</p>
<h3>Economic Blind Spots</h3>
<p>
	Harrison did not foresee or adequately respond to growing economic distress among farmers and laborers, leading to rising dissatisfaction that would later influence the Populist movement.
</p>

	<h2>🔴 The Ugly – Electoral Defeat and Overshadowed Legacy</h2>

<h3>1892 Election Loss</h3>
<p>
	Harrison lost his bid for re-election to Grover Cleveland, making him one of the few presidents to serve non-consecutive terms. The loss underscored the unpopularity of his economic policies.
</p>
<h3>Legacy Obscured</h3>
<p>
	Despite achievements in naval expansion and veterans’ advocacy, Harrison’s presidency is often overshadowed by the tariff controversy and Cleveland’s subsequent second term.
</p>
<h3>Limited Long-Term Impact</h3>
<p>
	Harrison’s administration did not leave a lasting imprint on social reform or civil rights. His accomplishments were largely in areas of military and economic policy, leaving other issues unaddressed.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
	Benjamin Harrison was a diligent and patriotic president whose good lay in naval modernization, veterans’ support, and economic nationalism. His bad was unpopular economic policies and political vulnerability; his ugly was electoral defeat and a largely overshadowed legacy. Harrison illustrates how policy successes can be eclipsed by public perception and partisan challenges.
