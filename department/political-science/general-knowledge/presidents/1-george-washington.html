<h2>🟢 The Good – The Statesman, General, and Unifier</h2>
<h3>1. Leadership in the Revolution</h3>
<p>
	Washington’s greatest achievement was holding together the Continental Army through eight years of war against Britain. Despite limited supplies, mutinies, and defeats, he embodied perseverance. His victory at Yorktown (1781) sealed American independence.
</p>

<h3>2. The Reluctant President</h3>
<p>
	When offered kingship, Washington refused. His voluntary resignation from power after two presidential terms set a precedent that lasted until Franklin D. Roosevelt. It demonstrated that America’s leaders should serve the people, not rule them.
</p>

<h3>3. The Unifier of the States</h3>
<p>
	Washington guided a fragile nation through its formative years (1789–1797). His Farewell Address warned against political parties and foreign entanglements — advice still cited today. He promoted neutrality, stability, and civic virtue.
</p>

<h3>4. Character and Symbolism</h3>
<p>
	Known as the “Father of His Country,” Washington became a symbol of integrity, moderation, and service. Even his enemies admitted he possessed a rare dignity and moral steadiness.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>🔵 The Bad – The Aristocrat and Slaveholder</h2>

<h3>1. Slave Ownership</h3>
<p>
	Washington owned more than 300 enslaved people at Mount Vernon. Although he freed his enslaved workers in his will (the only Founding Father to do so), this happened only after his death. During life, he benefited directly from slave labor and enforced their capture when they fled.
</p>

<h3>2. Class Bias and Elitism</h3>
<p>
	Washington came from the Virginia planter class and held traditional aristocratic views. He distrusted “mob rule” and believed in government led by property-owning men. His presidency leaned toward maintaining the social order rather than radical equality.
</p>

<h3>3. Harsh Treatment of Soldiers and Farmers</h3>
<p>
	In 1794, he personally led troops against American citizens during the Whiskey Rebellion, showing his willingness to use force to maintain federal authority. To many frontier farmers, this seemed like the same kind of tyranny they had fought against.
</p>

<h2>🔴 The Ugly – The Myth and the Man</h2>

<h3>1. The Creation of a Legend</h3>
<p>
	Washington’s reputation was mythologized almost immediately after his death. Stories like the cherry tree tale (“I cannot tell a lie”) were invented to create a saintly image. This made him seem more like a marble statue than a human being.
</p>
<h3>2. Silence on Slavery and Native Policy</h3>
<p>
	Though he expressed mild discomfort with slavery, he avoided any national conversation about ending it — a missed opportunity to set the nation on a more just path. His policies also continued Native American displacement, supporting expansion that pushed tribes from their lands.
</p>
<h3>3. Controlled Image and Legacy</h3>
<p>
	Washington carefully managed his image as a virtuous leader above politics. In reality, he was deeply involved in party disputes, especially favoring Federalist policies under Hamilton, which shaped the economic elite’s power structure for decades.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
George Washington was not a saint, but a strategic and self-aware leader who understood the symbolic power of his role. He balanced ambition with restraint, moral awareness with self-interest. His good built the framework of American democracy; his bad and ugly remind us that freedom in America was born alongside deep contradictions.</p>
