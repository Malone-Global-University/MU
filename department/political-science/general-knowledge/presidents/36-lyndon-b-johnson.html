<h2>üü¢ The Good ‚Äì The Great Society and Civil Rights Champion</h2>

</p>
<h3>The Great Society Programs</h3>
<p>
	Johnson launched the Great Society, which aimed to eliminate poverty and expand social welfare. Programs included Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, and food stamps, transforming the social safety net.
</p>
<h3>Economic Expansion</h3>
<p>
	Under Johnson, the U.S. economy experienced low unemployment and moderate growth, partially fueled by domestic spending and social programs.
</p>
<h3>Education and Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
	Johnson prioritized education reform with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965) and invested in infrastructure improvements, including urban development and highways.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>üîµ The Bad ‚Äì Vietnam War and Domestic Division</h2>

<h3>Escalation of the Vietnam War</h3>
<p>
	Johnson dramatically increased U.S. involvement in Vietnam, deploying hundreds of thousands of troops. The war became increasingly unpopular and costly, undermining domestic support and overshadowing his achievements.
</p>
<h3>Civil Liberties Concerns</h3>
<p>
	In managing protests and dissent, especially anti-war demonstrations, Johnson faced criticism for overreach in surveillance and restriction of political activism.
</p>
<h3>Political Manipulation</h3>
<p>
	Johnson‚Äôs ‚ÄúJohnson Treatment‚Äù‚Äîintense lobbying and personal persuasion‚Äîwas effective but sometimes coercive, leaving political allies wary and fostering resentment.
</p>
<h3>Polarization of the Nation</h3>
<p>
	His domestic successes were overshadowed by war-related unrest, riots, and social upheaval, leaving the country divided by the late 1960s.
</p>

<section>
<h2>üî¥ The Ugly ‚Äì Legacy Complications</h2>

<h3>Moral and Strategic Questions in Vietnam</h3>
<p>
	The Vietnam War raised profound ethical and strategic criticisms, including civilian casualties, bombings, and unclear objectives. Johnson‚Äôs legacy is heavily weighed down by this conflict.
</p>
<h3>Undermined Political Capital</h3>
<p>
	Despite domestic triumphs, the war drained political energy and public trust, leading Johnson to decline reelection in 1968.
 </p>
<h3>Complex Historical Reputation</h3>
<p>
	Johnson is remembered as both a transformative domestic president and a war-time leader whose decisions caused national trauma, creating a deeply mixed legacy.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Lyndon B. Johnson was a transformative domestic leader whose good lay in civil rights, social welfare, and education reform. His bad included coercive political tactics and growing domestic division; his ugly was the Vietnam War, which overshadowed his achievements and complicated his historical legacy. Johnson illustrates the tension between visionary domestic leadership and the moral and political burdens of foreign conflict.
