<h2>ðŸ”µ The Bad â€“ Domestic Challenges and Policy Critiques</h2>

</p>
<h3>Afghanistan Withdrawal Fallout</h3>

	The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan (2021), while ending Americaâ€™s longest war, was widely criticized for chaotic execution, humanitarian concerns, and damage to U.S. credibility.
</p>
<h3>Partisan Gridlock</h3>

	Despite holding majorities early in his term, Biden has faced legislative challenges, particularly with narrowly divided Congress, limiting the scope of some policy goals.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
	Joe Biden is a seasoned leader whose good lies in pandemic management, economic relief, infrastructure investment, and restoration of alliances. His bad includes inflation, border challenges, and Afghanistan withdrawal fallout; his ugly is ongoing polarization and uncertain historical legacy. Biden illustrates the difficulties of governing amid simultaneous domestic crises and global pressures.
