<h2>üü¢ The Good ‚Äì The Inspirational Leader and Global Strategist</h2>

<h3>Charismatic Leadership and Public Inspiration</h3>
<p>
	John F. Kennedy, the 35th U.S. President (1961‚Äì1963), captivated the nation with his charisma, eloquence, and vision. His inaugural call to ‚Äúask not what your country can do for you‚Äù inspired civic engagement and optimism.
</p>
<h3>Space Program and Scientific Advancement</h3>
<p>
	Kennedy championed the Apollo program, setting the goal to land a man on the Moon. This leadership spurred technological innovation, scientific achievement, and American global prestige.
</p>
<h3>Crisis Management ‚Äì Cuban Missile Crisis</h3>
<p>
	Kennedy successfully navigated the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), averting nuclear war through careful diplomacy, naval blockade, and negotiations with the Soviet Union.
</p>
<h3>Civil Rights Support</h3>
<p>
	Though cautious initially, Kennedy eventually advocated for civil rights, proposing landmark legislation and using federal authority to support desegregation efforts.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>üîµ The Bad ‚Äì Inexperience and Political Caution</h2>

<h3>Limited Domestic Legislative Achievements</h3>
<p>
	Kennedy‚Äôs domestic agenda faced congressional resistance, and many proposals, including civil rights legislation, were not enacted until after his death under Lyndon B. Johnson.
</p>
<h3>Bay of Pigs Invasion</h3>
<p>
	Kennedy approved the Bay of Pigs invasion (1961) of Cuba, which ended in failure and embarrassment for the U.S., exposing weaknesses in planning and intelligence oversight.
</p>
<h3>Cold War Escalation</h3>
<p>
	His early Cold War policies, including the Berlin Crisis, increased tensions with the USSR. While managed effectively at times, they carried risks of confrontation.
</p>
<h3>Personal Scandals</h3>
<p>
	Kennedy‚Äôs extramarital affairs and private life have been widely documented. While largely unknown to the public at the time, these personal indiscretions complicate his moral legacy.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>üî¥ The Ugly ‚Äì Assassination and Legacy Mythologization</h2>

<h3>Assassination and National Trauma</h3>
<p>
	Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, creating a profound national shock and cementing his image as a youthful, heroic figure.
</p>
<h3>Mythologized Presidency</h3>
<p>
	Kennedy‚Äôs early death, combined with charisma and tragedy, led to idealization and myth-making, often overshadowing policy realities and failures.
</p>
<h3>Cold War Risks</h3>
<p>
	While often praised for diplomacy, his presidency involved high-stakes nuclear brinkmanship (Cuban Missile Crisis, Berlin Crisis), demonstrating the potential dangers of Cold War leadership.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>John F. Kennedy was an inspirational and bold president whose good lay in public leadership, crisis management, and vision for space and civil rights. His bad included early missteps like the Bay of Pigs invasion and limited legislative accomplishments; his ugly was assassination, high Cold War risks, and the mythologization of his presidency. Kennedy embodies the interplay of charisma, tragedy, and policy in shaping historical memory.
