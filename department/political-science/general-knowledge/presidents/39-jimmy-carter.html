<h2>🟢 The Good – The Humanitarian and Moral Leader</h2>

<h3>Emphasis on Human Rights</h3>
<p>
	Jimmy Carter, the 39th U.S. President (1977–1981), prioritized human rights in foreign policy, holding both allies and adversaries accountable for abuses and using diplomacy to promote justice globally.
</p>
<h3>Camp David Accords</h3>
<p>
	Carter brokered the Camp David Accords (1978) between Egypt and Israel, achieving a landmark peace agreement that reduced tensions in the Middle East and earned him lasting recognition.
</p>
<h3>Energy and Environmental Initiatives</h3>
<p>
	He championed energy conservation, renewable energy, and environmental protection, creating the Department of Energy and promoting solar programs, anticipating future energy challenges.
</p>
<h3>Post-Presidency Humanitarian Work</h3>
<p>
	Although after leaving office, Carter’s work through The Carter Center and advocacy for democracy, health, and conflict resolution have greatly enhanced his global reputation.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>🔵 The Bad – Economic and Domestic Challenges</h2>

<h3>Stagflation</h3>
<p>
	Carter faced high inflation, slow economic growth, and unemployment, a combination known as stagflation, which eroded public confidence in his leadership.
</p>
<h3>Energy Crisis and Public Perception</h3>
<p>
	Despite pushing energy reform, the 1979 energy crisis, long gas lines, and a perceived inability to resolve economic hardship damaged his public image.
</p>
<h3>Limited Legislative Success</h3>
<p>
	Carter often struggled to work effectively with Congress, limiting his ability to pass major domestic reforms beyond energy and environmental initiatives.
</p>
<h3>Mixed Foreign Policy Record</h3>
<p>
	While successful with the Camp David Accords, Carter faced difficulties elsewhere, including rising tensions with the Soviet Union and mismanagement in Iran, which weakened his foreign policy credibility.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>🔴 The Ugly – Crisis and Public Humiliation</h2>

<h3>Iran Hostage Crisis</h3>
<p>
	The 1979–1981 Iran Hostage Crisis, during which 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days, became a symbol of American weakness and dominated media coverage, contributing to his electoral defeat.
</p>
<h3>Perceived Weakness and Ineffectiveness</h3>
<p>
	Carter’s style of detailed, moralistic governance was often seen as micromanaging yet indecisive, leaving him vulnerable to criticism during crises.
</p>
<h3>Electoral Defeat</h3>
<p>
	Carter’s presidency ended in a landslide defeat by Ronald Reagan (1980), reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with his handling of economic and international challenges.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Jimmy Carter was a principled and moral president whose good lay in human rights advocacy, the Camp David peace process, and environmental leadership. His bad included economic mismanagement, limited legislative achievements, and struggles with Congress; his ugly was the Iran Hostage Crisis and public perception of weakness. Carter demonstrates the challenges of ethical, idealistic leadership in the face of complex domestic and international crises.
