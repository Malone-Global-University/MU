<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
	President Donald Trump's second term has been marked by significant diplomatic achievements, particularly in the Middle East, and decisive actions to maintain military readiness during a federal government shutdown. However, his administration continues to grapple with domestic challenges, including a prolonged government shutdown and ongoing political polarization. Legal controversies from his 2024 campaign raise questions about the intersection of law and politics in his presidency. As his term progresses, the balance between his policy successes and the controversies surrounding his leadership will shape the legacy of his return to the White House.
