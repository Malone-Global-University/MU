<h2>üü¢ The Good ‚Äì The Humble Origins and Loyal Unionist</h2>

<h3>From Poverty to Presidency</h3>
<p>
	Andrew Johnson, the 17th U.S. President (1865‚Äì1869), rose from humble beginnings in rural North Carolina and Tennessee to the nation‚Äôs highest office. His story symbolized social mobility and the ‚Äúcommon man‚Äù ideal in 19th-century America.
</p>
<h3>Strong Unionist During the Civil War</h3>
<p>
	Johnson, a Southern Democrat, remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War. As Military Governor of Tennessee, he helped restore federal control over occupied territories and promoted loyalty among Southerners who remained in the Union.
</p>
<h3>Support for Presidential Authority</h3>
<p>
	Johnson believed in a strong executive branch. He aimed to direct Reconstruction personally, emphasizing presidential discretion over Congressional authority in restoring Southern states to the Union.
</p>
<h3>Quick Restoration of Southern States</h3>
<p>
	Johnson moved swiftly to readmit Confederate states with minimal conditions, believing that reconciliation should be prioritized to rebuild the nation quickly after the Civil War.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>üîµ The Bad ‚Äì The Ineffective and Combative President</h2>

<h3>Lenient Reconstruction Policies</h3>
<p>
	Johnson‚Äôs approach to Reconstruction was too lenient toward the former Confederacy. He allowed Southern states to enact ‚ÄúBlack Codes‚Äù that severely restricted the rights of newly freed African Americans, undermining civil rights progress.
</p>
<h3>Conflict with Congress</h3>
<p>
	Johnson clashed repeatedly with the Radical Republicans in Congress, who sought stronger protections for freedmen. His frequent vetoes of civil rights legislation and refusal to enforce Reconstruction policies led to a political deadlock.
</p>
<h3>Impeachment</h3>
<p>
	Johnson became the first U.S. president to be impeached (1868), primarily for violating the Tenure of Office Act by removing Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. He narrowly avoided removal by one Senate vote, highlighting his political vulnerability.
</p>
<h3>Weak Political Skills</h3>
<p>
	Johnson‚Äôs abrasive personality, stubbornness, and inability to compromise left him isolated. Even members of his own party criticized his actions, and he struggled to build coalitions to govern effectively.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>üî¥ The Ugly ‚Äì Race, Division, and Tarnished Legacy</h2>

<h3>Failure to Protect African Americans</h3>
<p>
	Johnson‚Äôs Reconstruction policies allowed white supremacist structures to persist in the South. The lack of federal enforcement during his presidency set back civil rights and contributed to decades of racial oppression.
</p>

<h3>Deep National Divisions</h3>
<p>
	His presidency intensified conflict between the executive and legislative branches and between North and South. Johnson‚Äôs stubbornness worsened sectional tensions during a critical period of national recovery.
</p>
<h3>Historical Reputation</h3>
<p>
	Johnson is often ranked among the worst U.S. presidents due to his failures in leadership, inability to enforce civil rights, and confrontational style. His legacy is largely overshadowed by Lincoln‚Äôs accomplishments and the Radical Republicans‚Äô Reconstruction achievements.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Andrew Johnson was a Unionist from humble origins who sought to restore the nation quickly after the Civil War. His good lay in loyalty and commitment to executive authority; his bad was ineffective, combative leadership; his ugly was the failure to protect African Americans and the exacerbation of sectional tensions. Johnson demonstrates how presidential power without moral and political foresight can deepen national wounds.
