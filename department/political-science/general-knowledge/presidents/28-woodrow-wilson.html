<h2>🟢 The Good – The Reformer and International Visionary</h2>
<h3>Progressive Domestic Reforms</h3>
<p>
	Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. President (1913–1921), implemented significant Progressive Era legislation. His New Freedom program lowered tariffs (Underwood Tariff), reformed banking (Federal Reserve Act), and strengthened antitrust enforcement (Clayton Antitrust Act).
</p>
<h3>Labor and Social Protections</h3>
<p>
	Wilson supported labor rights, including the eight-hour workday for railroad workers and the establishment of the Federal Trade Commission, promoting fair competition and workers’ protections.
</p>
<h3>Leadership During World War I</h3>
<p>
	Wilson guided the United States through World War I, providing stability, mobilizing the economy, and raising public morale. His leadership helped the Allies and strengthened America’s international role.
</p>
<h3>International Vision – League of Nations</h3>
<p>
	Wilson was a leading advocate for the League of Nations, envisioning a post-war world of collective security, diplomacy, and conflict prevention, laying groundwork for later international organizations.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>🔵 The Bad – Racism and Limited Domestic Enforcement</h2>

<h3>Racial Policies</h3>
<p>
	Wilson’s administration segregated federal offices and allowed discriminatory practices in government employment. He also failed to challenge racial violence and lynching, cementing systemic inequality.
</p>
<h3>Repression of Dissent</h3>
<p>
	During WWI, Wilson supported the Espionage Act (1917) and Sedition Act (1918), limiting free speech and suppressing anti-war dissent, including targeting socialists and labor organizers.
</p>
<h3>Inconsistent Progressive Record</h3>
<p>
	While promoting reform, Wilson sometimes sided with conservative business interests and failed to fully address women’s suffrage until political pressure made it inevitable (19th Amendment ratified 1920).
</p>
<h3>Health and Leadership Limitations</h3>
<p>
	A stroke in 1919 left Wilson incapacitated for months, and his wife, Edith Wilson, took a leading role in managing presidential duties, raising questions about governance during a national crisis.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>🔴 The Ugly – International Overreach and Domestic Failures</h2>

<h3>Treaty of Versailles and League Rejection</h3>
<p>
	Wilson’s idealism for the League of Nations faced domestic opposition. The U.S. Senate rejected the treaty, undermining his foreign policy vision and contributing to future global instability.
</p>
<h3>Authoritarian Governance Style</h3>
<p>
	Wilson’s reliance on executive authority, especially during wartime, and his suppression of dissent has been criticized as overly authoritarian, conflicting with democratic principles.
</p>
<h3>Legacy Tarnished by Racism</h3>
<p>
	Despite progressive reforms, Wilson’s policies reinforced racial segregation and disenfranchisement, leaving a lasting stain on his historical legacy.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Woodrow Wilson was a transformative yet controversial president. His good lay in progressive reforms, labor protections, and visionary internationalism. His bad included inconsistent domestic enforcement and suppression of dissent; his ugly was entrenched racial segregation and the failure of the League of Nations. Wilson’s presidency demonstrates the tension between idealism and practical governance, and the enduring consequences of racial and authoritarian policies.</p>
