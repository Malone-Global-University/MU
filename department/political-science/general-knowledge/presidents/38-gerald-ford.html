<h2>🟢 The Good – The Steadying Hand</h2>

<h3>Restoring Trust After Watergate</h3>
<p>
	Gerald Ford, the 38th U.S. President (1974–1977), assumed office after Richard Nixon’s resignation. His leadership helped restore stability and calm to a nation shaken by scandal and distrust.
</p>
<h3>Decisive Leadership and Integrity</h3>
<p>
	Ford was known for his honesty, personal integrity, and transparency, providing a contrast to Nixon and emphasizing ethical governance.
</p>
<h3>Foreign Policy Experience</h3>
<p>
	Ford continued the policy of détente with the Soviet Union and maintained U.S. commitments to NATO, while navigating challenges such as the fall of Saigon (1975) and ongoing Cold War tensions.
</p>
<h3>Pragmatic Domestic Approach</h3>
<p>
	He attempted to address economic challenges, including inflation and recession, with policies like the “Whip Inflation Now” (WIN) campaign, emphasizing voluntary restraint and fiscal responsibility.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>🔵 The Bad – Limited Impact and Economic Struggles</h2>

<h3>Economic Difficulties</h3>
<p>
	Ford faced stagflation (high inflation combined with slow growth) and rising unemployment. His policies were largely ineffective in reversing economic decline, and his WIN program was widely mocked.
</p>
<h3>Pardoning Nixon</h3>
<p>
	Ford’s decision to pardon Nixon for any crimes related to Watergate was controversial. While intended to heal the nation, it hurt his popularity and fueled speculation about political favoritism.
</p>

<h3>Limited Legislative Success</h3>
<p>
	Ford was largely reactive in domestic policy, passing few major initiatives. His presidency lacked a bold legislative agenda, reducing his long-term impact.
</p>
<h3>Political Vulnerability</h3>
<p>
	Ford struggled to unite the Republican Party and failed to energize voters, contributing to his defeat in the 1976 election against Jimmy Carter.
</p>

<section>
	<h2>🔴 The Ugly – Overshadowed and Underrated</h2>

<h3>Fall of Saigon</h3>
<p>
	The collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 during Ford’s presidency marked a painful end to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, a significant foreign policy and symbolic challenge.
</p>
<h3>Public Perception Challenges</h3>
<p>
	Ford was often perceived as ineffectual, with media focus on minor missteps (like publicized slips and gaffes), overshadowing his stabilizing achievements.
</p>
<h3>Historical Overshadowing</h3>
<p>
	Ford’s short tenure and the shadow of Nixon’s scandals left him underappreciated in historical memory, often seen as a caretaker rather than a transformative leader.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
	Gerald Ford was a stabilizing and ethical president whose good lay in restoring trust after Watergate and maintaining steady governance. His bad included economic struggles and limited legislative achievements; his ugly was the fall of Saigon and public perception of ineffectiveness. Ford demonstrates how integrity and calm leadership can stabilize a nation even without bold or transformative actions.
