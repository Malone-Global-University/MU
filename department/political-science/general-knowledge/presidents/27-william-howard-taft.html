<h2>ðŸŸ¢ The Good â€“ The Jurist, Administrator, and Reform Advocate</h2>
<h3>Experienced Public Servant</h3>
<p>William Howard Taft, the 27th U.S. President (1909â€“1913), had a long career in government, including service as Secretary of War under Theodore Roosevelt and Governor-General of the Philippines, earning a reputation for administrative skill and legal expertise.</p>

<h3>Trust-Busting and Antitrust Enforcement</h3>
<p>
	Taft pursued antitrust cases aggressively, filing more lawsuits than Roosevelt. He believed in enforcing the law impartially, regardless of political pressures, demonstrating a commitment to fairness in business regulation.
</p>
<h3>Judicial Temperament and Later Supreme Court Service</h3>
<p>
	Taft was respected for his legal mind. After his presidency, he fulfilled his lifelong ambition of serving as Chief Justice of the United States (1921â€“1930), shaping the judiciary with distinction.
</p>
<h3>Civil Service Reform</h3>
<p>
	Taft continued progressive efforts to promote merit-based appointments and reduce patronage, strengthening the efficiency and integrity of federal service.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>ðŸ”µ The Bad â€“ The Political Ineffectiveness</h2>

<h3>Strained Relations with Progressives</h3>
<p>
	Taftâ€™s presidency alienated Progressive Republicans, including Roosevelt. His cautious approach to reform disappointed activists, leading to party splits and weakening political support.
</p>
<h3>Payne-Aldrich Tariff Controversy</h3>
<p>
	Taft signed the Payne-Aldrich Tariff (1909), which was meant to lower tariffs but largely maintained high rates. This angered reformers and damaged his reputation as a progressive leader.
</p>
<h3>Lack of Charisma and Public Appeal</h3>
<p>
	Taftâ€™s demeanor was judicial, cautious, and reserved, making him less effective in mobilizing public opinion compared to Roosevelt. His personality limited his political influence and public connection.
</p>
<h3>Alienation of Roosevelt</h3>
<p>
	The personal and political split with Roosevelt culminated in the Bull Moose Party in 1912, dividing Republicans and contributing to Woodrow Wilsonâ€™s victory.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>ðŸ”´ The Ugly â€“ Political Defeat and Legacy Challenges</h2>

<h3>1912 Election Loss</h3>
<p>
	Taftâ€™s inability to unify the Republican Party led to a landslide loss to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. This defeat marked the low point of his political career and demonstrated his weaknesses as a politician.
</p>
<h3>Overshadowed by Roosevelt</h3>
<p>
	Despite accomplishments in trust-busting and reform, Taft is often remembered as less dynamic than Roosevelt, overshadowed in both historical memory and public perception.
</p>
<h3>Frustrated Progressive Potential</h3>

<p>
	Taftâ€™s cautious approach left many reformist goals incomplete. Historians often view his presidency as competent but lacking bold vision, especially in contrast to his predecessor.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
William Howard Taft was a competent, principled president whose good lay in trust-busting, civil service reform, and judicial skill. His bad was political ineffectiveness, poor public appeal, and tariff controversies; his ugly was the Republican Party split and 1912 election loss. Taft illustrates how competence and integrity in office do not always translate into political success or lasting public acclaim.</p>
