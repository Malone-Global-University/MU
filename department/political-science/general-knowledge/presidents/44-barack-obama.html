<h3>Historic Firsts and Inspirational Leadership</h3>

<section>
<h2>🔵 The Bad – Challenges and Limitations</h2>

<h3>Foreign Policy Limitations</h3>
<p>
	While achieving notable diplomatic successes, Obama faced protracted conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, as well as the rise of ISIS, highlighting challenges in ending military engagements decisively.
</p>
<h3>Partisan Gridlock</h3>
<p>
	Despite legislative successes, Obama struggled with Congressional obstruction, limiting some initiatives and fostering partisan polarization that hindered policy implementation.
</p>
<h3>Economic Critiques</h3>

</p>
<h3>Immigration and Domestic Policy Gaps</h3>

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
	Barack Obama was a historic and transformative president whose good lay in inspiring leadership, economic stabilization, healthcare reform, and diplomacy. His bad included incomplete economic and domestic reforms, prolonged foreign conflicts, and partisan gridlock; his ugly was ethical controversy over drone strikes, rising polarization, and mythologized historical narratives. Obama exemplifies the tension between visionary leadership and practical political constraints in a divided nation.
