<h2>ðŸŸ¢ The Good â€“ The Honest Reformer and Fiscal Conservative</h2>

<h3>Integrity and Independence</h3>
<p>
	Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th U.S. President (1885â€“1889, 1893â€“1897), was renowned for his honesty. He refused to engage in political patronage, earning respect as a leader who prioritized principle over party.
</p>
<h3>Civil Service Reform Advocate</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland supported merit-based federal appointments, continuing the fight against the spoils system and promoting competent, ethical governance.
</p>
<h3>Fiscal Responsibility</h3>
<p>
	He opposed unnecessary government spending, vetoing excessive pension bills for Civil War veterans and supporting the gold standard, which helped maintain economic stability.
</p>
<h3>Strong Use of Presidential Authority</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland frequently exercised his veto power to check Congress when bills were fiscally or morally questionable, demonstrating independence and dedication to principle.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>ðŸ”µ The Bad â€“ Stubborn and Inflexible</h2>

<h3>Frequent Vetoes</h3>
<p>
	Clevelandâ€™s assertive vetoes earned criticism, particularly from veterans and political allies who felt frustrated by his refusal to compromise.
</p>
<h3>Labor and Economic Policies</h3>
<p>
	During the Panic of 1893, Clevelandâ€™s strict adherence to the gold standard and opposition to inflationary measures alienated farmers and laborers seeking relief.
</p>
<h3>Limited Social Reform</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland prioritized fiscal responsibility over addressing poverty, inequality, or labor unrest, leaving some progressive reforms unaddressed.
</p>
<h3>Political Isolation</h3>
<p>
	His independence sometimes antagonized both Democrats and Republicans, weakening his support base and limiting his political maneuverability.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>ðŸ”´ The Ugly â€“ Economic Crisis and National Discontent</h2>

<h3>Panic of 1893</h3>
<p>
	Clevelandâ€™s second term coincided with a severe economic depression, with widespread unemployment, bank failures, and business collapses, generating public dissatisfaction.
</p>
<h3>Pullman Strike Response</h3>
<p>
	Cleveland federalized troops to break the Pullman Strike (1894), siding with business over labor and exacerbating class tensions.
</p>
<h3>Historical Overshadowing</h3>
<p>
	While admired for integrity, Clevelandâ€™s presidency is often remembered for economic hardship and labor conflict rather than transformative accomplishments.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Grover Cleveland was a principled, fiscally conservative president whose good lay in integrity, civil service reform, and independent leadership. His bad was inflexibility and political isolation; his ugly was the economic turmoil and labor unrest of his second term. Cleveland exemplifies the tension between principled governance and practical crisis management.
