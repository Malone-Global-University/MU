<h2>ðŸ”µ The Bad â€“ Expansionism and Controversy</h2>

<h3>Imperial Ambitions</h3>
<p>
	McKinley supported the annexation of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War. While these moves expanded American influence, they sparked debate over imperialism and the ethics of overseas colonial rule.
</p>
<h3>Economic Elitism</h3>
<p>
	His protectionist policies favored industrialists over farmers and workers in some regions, creating tension between urban and rural populations.
</p>
<h3>Political Caution and Indecision</h3>
<p>
	McKinley often relied on advisors and Congress to make decisions, which critics argue limited his decisiveness in domestic reforms and delayed responses to emerging social issues.
</p>
<h3>Labor Discontent</h3>
<p>
	During McKinleyâ€™s presidency, strikes and labor unrest occasionally flared. While not uniquely his fault, his administrationâ€™s pro-business stance drew criticism from labor groups.

	<h2>ðŸ”´ The Ugly â€“ Assassination and the Dawn of a New Era</h2>

<h3>Assassination</h3>
<p>
	On September 6, 1901, McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz and died on September 14, 1901. His death shocked the nation and ushered in the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, signaling a shift toward more progressive policies.
</p>
<h3>Philippine-American War</h3>
<p>
	The annexation of the Philippines led to the Philippine-American War (1899â€“1902), a bloody conflict with high civilian and military casualties, tarnishing the moral legacy of McKinleyâ€™s expansionist policies.
</p>
<h3>Historical Overshadowing</h3>
<p>
	Though effective, McKinley is sometimes overshadowed by Roosevelt and the progressive era that followed. His presidency is often remembered more for his death and imperial controversies than domestic achievements.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>	William McKinley was an experienced and moderate president whose good lay in economic policy, national unity, and wartime leadership. His bad was cautious domestic policy and contentious imperial expansion; his ugly was assassination and the bloody consequences of overseas colonization. McKinley illustrates the rise of the U.S. as a global power and the moral and political dilemmas of imperial ambition.
