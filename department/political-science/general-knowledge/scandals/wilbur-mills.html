  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">Wilbur Mills, a long-serving U.S. Congressman from Arkansas, was one of the most powerful members of the House Ways and Means Committee. In the mid-1970s, he became embroiled in controversy due to his publicized relationship with Fanne Foxe, an exotic dancer, which drew the attention of national media and political opponents.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Events</h2>
  <p class="wide">In 1974, Mills was arrested after an incident involving Foxe on the Potomac River, which became widely reported in newspapers and television. The scandal sparked debates about personal conduct, morality, and the standards expected of elected officials. Mills temporarily stepped down from his committee leadership, facing intense public scrutiny.</p>

  <h2>Impact & Legacy</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Wilbur Mills Scandal highlighted the intersection of private behavior and public accountability in American politics. While Mills returned to Congress, his influence was diminished, and the incident remains a cautionary example of how personal misconduct can affect political careers.</p>
