<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The <strong>Indian Ring Scandal</strong> was one of several corruption cases that tainted the presidency of <strong>Ulysses S. Grant</strong>. 
    It involved high-ranking officials in the <strong>Office of Indian Affairs</strong> who accepted bribes from private traders in exchange for exclusive access to Native American trading posts on reservations.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    During the 19th century, federal Indian agencies oversaw trade and supplies for Native American reservations. 
    The Grant administration’s “Peace Policy” sought to reduce military involvement and promote civilian oversight, but it also created opportunities for political patronage and profiteering.  
    Control over reservation trade became a lucrative source of bribery and corruption.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The Scandal Unfolds</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Secretary of War <strong>William W. Belknap</strong> was implicated after evidence showed that his wife had accepted kickbacks from traders who sought appointment to lucrative posts at western forts.  
    Although Belknap resigned in 1876 just before impeachment proceedings, the <strong>House of Representatives</strong> still voted to impeach him — the first Cabinet member ever impeached.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Aftermath</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The Senate ultimately acquitted Belknap on jurisdictional grounds, as he was no longer in office, but the scandal reinforced public perceptions of widespread corruption in Grant’s administration.  
    It also highlighted the exploitation of Native Americans and the misuse of federal programs designed for their welfare.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The Indian Ring scandal contributed to the erosion of public trust in government and weakened Grant’s reform agenda.  
    It remains a cautionary tale about how political favoritism and lack of oversight can undermine humanitarian programs and policy integrity.
  </p>

    <li>How did the Indian Ring scandal expose flaws in Grant’s “Peace Policy” toward Native Americans?</li>
    <li>Why did corruption flourish within the Office of Indian Affairs during this period?</li>
    <li>How might stronger accountability mechanisms have prevented this scandal?</li>
