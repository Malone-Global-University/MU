<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">During the early years of the Cold War, fears of communist infiltration gripped the United States. Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed that numerous government officials and prominent Americans were secretly communists, prompting investigations and public hearings.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Events</h2>
  <p class="wide">From 1950 to 1954, McCarthy held hearings in the Senate and collaborated with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to interrogate alleged communists in government, the military, and entertainment. Accusations were often based on flimsy evidence, leading to blacklisting, ruined careers, and widespread fear. Televised hearings made the events highly visible to the public.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Impact & Legacy</h2>
  <p class="wide">The McCarthy hearings contributed to a climate of political fear known as the Red Scare. Civil liberties were curtailed, and public trust in government and institutions was shaken. McCarthy’s influence waned after the Army–McCarthy hearings and his censure by the Senate in 1954, but the period remains a cautionary tale of political overreach.</p>
</section>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul class="wide">
    <li>How did the McCarthy hearings impact civil liberties in the United States?</li>
    <li>What role did media coverage play in shaping public perception of the hearings?</li>
    <li>Can parallels be drawn between McCarthyism and modern political investigations?</li>
  </ul>
