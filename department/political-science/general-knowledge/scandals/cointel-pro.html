  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The <strong>Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO)</strong> was a series of covert FBI operations conducted between 1956 and 1971. 
    Its stated goal was to monitor and neutralize “subversive” organizations within the United States — but in practice, it became a tool of political repression, 
    targeting civil rights leaders, socialist groups, and critics of U.S. government policy.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Origins and Objectives</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Initiated by FBI Director <strong>J. Edgar Hoover</strong>, COINTELPRO initially focused on the Communist Party USA but soon expanded to include 
    civil rights and Black liberation movements, anti–Vietnam War groups, feminist organizations, and student activists. 
    Hoover viewed these movements as threats to national security and social order.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Methods of Disruption</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    FBI agents used surveillance, forged documents, wiretaps, and infiltration to create internal divisions and discredit leaders. 
    Targets included <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>, <strong>Malcolm X</strong>, the <strong>Black Panther Party</strong>, the <strong>Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)</strong>, and others.  
    Psychological warfare tactics — such as anonymous letters, smear campaigns, and false arrests — were common.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Exposure and Public Outcry</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    In 1971, activists broke into an FBI field office in Media, Pennsylvania, and leaked documents revealing the existence of COINTELPRO to the press.  
    The revelations sparked outrage, leading to the <strong>Church Committee</strong> hearings in Congress, which confirmed widespread FBI abuses of power and constitutional violations.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Aftermath and Reforms</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Following the exposure, COINTELPRO was officially terminated.  
    New regulations were introduced to restrict domestic surveillance and protect civil liberties.  
    However, the scandal left a lasting legacy of mistrust between the government and marginalized political groups.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    COINTELPRO remains one of the most controversial operations in American history — a symbol of how national security measures can be weaponized against political dissent.  
    Its lessons continue to shape modern debates about privacy, law enforcement, and freedom of expression.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul class="wide">
    <li>How did COINTELPRO shape public attitudes toward the FBI and federal surveillance?</li>
    <li>What parallels exist between COINTELPRO and modern surveillance programs?</li>
    <li>How can governments balance national security with civil rights protections?</li>
  </ul>
