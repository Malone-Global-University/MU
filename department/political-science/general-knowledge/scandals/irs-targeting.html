<main>

<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">In 2013, reports emerged that the IRS had subjected certain political organizations, particularly conservative and Tea Party groups, to additional scrutiny when reviewing applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status. Critics argued this practice reflected political bias and violated principles of equal treatment under federal law.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Events</h2>
  <p class="wide">Internal investigations revealed that IRS employees had applied extra review procedures inconsistently, often flagging organizations based on keywords in applications. The controversy led to congressional hearings, the resignation of the IRS Commissioner, and heightened scrutiny of federal agency procedures to ensure nonpartisan enforcement.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Impact & Legacy</h2>
  <p class="wide">The controversy prompted reforms in IRS procedures, including standardized review processes and additional training to prevent political bias. Public trust in the agency was affected, and the scandal remains a notable example of the consequences of perceived partisanship within federal oversight bodies.</p>
