  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Keating Five Scandal arose during the savings & loan crisis of the late 1980s. Charles Keating, owner of Lincoln Savings & Loan, faced regulatory action as his bank neared collapse. Five U.S. Senators—Alan Cranston, Dennis DeConcini, John Glenn, John McCain, and Donald Riegle—were accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators on Keating’s behalf, allegedly to protect his investments and political contributions.</p>

  <h2>Events</h2>
  <p class="wide">Senate Ethics Committee investigations from 1989 to 1991 revealed varying degrees of ethical lapses. Three senators were reprimanded lightly, while two were cleared of wrongdoing. The scandal highlighted the risks of political influence and campaign contributions affecting regulatory oversight and public trust.</p>

  <h2>Impact & Legacy</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Keating Five Scandal brought attention to ethical standards for elected officials, the influence of money in politics, and the need for stronger regulatory oversight of financial institutions. It remains a case study in political accountability during financial crises.</p>
