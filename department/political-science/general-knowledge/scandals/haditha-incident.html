  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">On November 19, 2005, U.S. Marines in Haditha, Iraq, killed 24 civilians, including women and children, following the death of a Marine from an improvised explosive device (IED). Initial reports described the killings as combat-related, but investigations later suggested potential misconduct and violations of rules of engagement.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Investigation</h2>
  <p class="wide">Military and civilian investigations were launched, including a Pentagon inquiry and criminal investigations. Several Marines were charged with crimes ranging from dereliction of duty to murder, though some charges were later dropped or resulted in reduced sentences. The incident highlighted gaps in oversight, rules of engagement, and accountability in combat zones.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Impact & Legacy</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Haditha Incident became a symbol of the ethical and operational challenges faced by the U.S. military during the Iraq War. It raised public awareness of civilian casualties in combat, prompted policy reviews, and underscored the importance of transparent reporting and accountability mechanisms for military operations.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul class="wide">
    <li>How can military operations balance combat objectives with civilian protection?</li>
    <li>What mechanisms should exist to ensure accountability for war crimes or misconduct?</li>
    <li>How do media reports influence public perception of military actions?</li>
  </ul>
