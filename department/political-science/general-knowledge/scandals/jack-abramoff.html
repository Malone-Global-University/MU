<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The <strong>Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal</strong> was a massive corruption case that revealed the dark side of Washington influence. 
    Lobbyist <strong>Jack Abramoff</strong> engaged in bribery, fraud, and illegal lobbying activities that funneled millions of dollars from clients—especially Native American tribes—into personal gain and political favors.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Abramoff was one of Washington’s most powerful lobbyists in the early 2000s, connected to high-ranking Republicans like <strong>Tom DeLay</strong> and <strong>Ralph Reed</strong>.  
    He represented Native American tribes seeking to protect their casino interests but charged them exorbitant fees and redirected much of the money to personal enrichment and political contributions.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Scandal Unfolds</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    In 2004, a series of Senate investigations led by Senator <strong>John McCain</strong> uncovered that Abramoff and his associates defrauded tribes of more than $80 million.  
    He used these funds to buy influence in Congress, pay for luxury trips, and finance political campaigns.  
    Several lawmakers, aides, and officials were implicated in the scandal, including members of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Interior.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Legal Consequences</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Abramoff pled guilty in 2006 to charges of <strong>conspiracy, mail fraud, and tax evasion</strong>.  
    He was sentenced to nearly six years in federal prison and ordered to repay millions in restitution.  
    His case became a symbol of systemic corruption in Washington and prompted renewed calls for lobbying reform and transparency.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The scandal led to major legislative reforms, including the <strong>Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007</strong>, 
    which tightened rules on lobbying disclosure and gift-giving to lawmakers.  
    Abramoff’s name became synonymous with influence peddling and the revolving door between lobbying firms and government offices.
  </p>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul class="wide">
    <li>How did Abramoff’s relationships with political figures enable his schemes to continue for so long?</li>
    <li>What does this scandal reveal about the structure of lobbying and campaign finance in the U.S.?</li>
    <li>Have reforms since the 2000s effectively reduced corruption in Washington?</li>
  </ul>
