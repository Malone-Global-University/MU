<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The <strong>Rod Blagojevich corruption scandal</strong> centered on the Illinois governor’s attempt to sell or trade the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama in 2008.  
    The scandal led to Blagojevich’s impeachment, removal from office, and eventual conviction on federal corruption charges.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Elected governor in 2002, <strong>Rod Blagojevich</strong> campaigned as a reformer promising to clean up Illinois politics after years of corruption.  
    However, his administration soon became known for patronage, pay-to-play schemes, and aggressive fundraising tactics that blurred ethical lines.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Scandal Unfolds</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Federal investigators wiretapped Blagojevich’s phone in 2008, capturing conversations in which he referred to Obama’s vacant Senate seat as “golden” and expressed frustration at not being offered sufficient personal benefit in exchange for appointing a replacement.  
    He was arrested by the FBI in December 2008 on charges including <strong>conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Impeachment and Trial</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The Illinois House of Representatives voted 114-1 to impeach Blagojevich, and the State Senate unanimously removed him from office in January 2009.  
    His federal trial began in 2010, resulting in convictions for <strong>wire fraud, bribery, and extortion</strong>.  
    In 2011, he was sentenced to <strong>14 years in prison</strong>, the longest sentence for an Illinois governor in modern history.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Aftermath and Pardon</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Blagojevich served nearly eight years before being <strong>granted clemency by President Donald Trump</strong> in 2020.  
    His release reignited debate about political accountability, executive power, and the persistence of corruption in Illinois politics—where four of the last seven governors have served prison time.

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul class="wide">
    <li>How does the Blagojevich case illustrate the intersection of political ambition and corruption?</li>
    <li>What systemic factors contribute to recurring corruption in Illinois state government?</li>
    <li>Should presidential clemency extend to convicted politicians?</li>
  </ul>
