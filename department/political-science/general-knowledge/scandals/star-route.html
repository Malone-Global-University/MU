<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The <strong>Star Route Scandal</strong> was a major 19th-century political corruption case involving fraudulent contracts for mail delivery on remote “star routes” across the American West. 
    Wealthy contractors conspired with postal officials to inflate delivery costs and receive excessive payments from the federal government.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    “Star routes” referred to postal delivery lines in sparsely populated or frontier areas, where mail carriers used horses and wagons rather than rail. 
    These routes were denoted by three asterisks (★ ★ ★) in official documents—meaning delivery by “celerity, certainty, and security.”  
    Because of limited oversight, contractors frequently bribed postal clerks to win bids and later overcharge for service.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The Scandal Unfolds</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Investigations under Presidents <strong>Rutherford B. Hayes</strong> and <strong>James A. Garfield</strong> revealed that senior postal officials and contractors colluded to skim profits from inflated mail contracts.  
    Prominent figures like <strong>Senator Stephen W. Dorsey</strong> and <strong>Thomas J. Brady</strong>, Second Assistant Postmaster General, were accused of accepting bribes.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Aftermath</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Multiple trials followed between 1882 and 1883 under President <strong>Chester A. Arthur</strong>. 
    Although several defendants were acquitted due to weak evidence and political influence, the scandal damaged public confidence and highlighted deep corruption in federal contracting systems.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The Star Route Scandal spurred calls for civil service reform and greater transparency in government procurement. 
    It helped build momentum for the <strong>Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883</strong>, which established merit-based hiring and reduced patronage in federal appointments.

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul class="wide">
    <li>Why were “star routes” particularly vulnerable to fraud and corruption?</li>
    <li>How did public reaction to the scandal influence later government reforms?</li>
    <li>What lessons about oversight and accountability remain relevant today?</li>
  </ul>
