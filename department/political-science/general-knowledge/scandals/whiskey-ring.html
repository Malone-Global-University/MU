  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The <strong>Whiskey Ring Scandal</strong> was one of the most significant corruption cases of the 19th century, unfolding during President <strong>Ulysses S. Grant’s</strong> administration in 1875. 
    The scandal involved a conspiracy among distillers, distributors, and government officials to evade liquor taxes and defraud the U.S. Treasury.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Following the Civil War, the federal government imposed high taxes on whiskey to help pay off war debts. 
    A network of distillers and Internal Revenue agents conspired to underreport production, keeping profits for themselves while depriving the Treasury of millions. 
    The scheme spread across multiple states, centered in St. Louis, Missouri.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The Scandal Unfolds</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    Investigations by Treasury Secretary <strong>Benjamin Bristow</strong> uncovered extensive fraud and bribery within the Internal Revenue Service. 
    Over 200 individuals were indicted, including distillers, officials, and Grant’s own private secretary, <strong>Orville E. Babcock</strong>. 
    Although Grant personally testified on Babcock’s behalf, his administration’s reputation for reform was severely tarnished.

<section>
  <h2>Impact and Aftermath</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The Whiskey Ring case exposed the deep entanglement between business and politics during the Reconstruction era. 
    While some officials were convicted, many escaped serious punishment through political influence or presidential intervention. 
    The scandal undermined public confidence in Grant’s leadership and helped inspire later calls for civil service reform.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The scandal remains a defining example of <strong>Gilded Age corruption</strong>, illustrating the dangers of patronage politics and weak oversight. 
    It also demonstrated the importance of internal investigations and the press in holding government accountable — principles that continue to shape political ethics today.

  <ul class="wide">
    <li>What economic and political factors made corruption so prevalent during the Gilded Age?</li>
    <li>How did the Whiskey Ring scandal influence later government reforms?</li>
    <li>Should Grant’s defense of his associates be viewed as loyalty or poor judgment?</li>
