A Declaration of Grievances Against White Supremacy and Its Supporters

Preamble:
When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a people to confront forces that perpetuate racial oppression and deny justice to all citizens, it is both moral and just to declare the causes which compel action against them.

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all people are created equal, that they are endowed with inherent dignity, rights, and freedoms, and that whenever any group or individual seeks to undermine these rights, it is the responsibility of the people to oppose them.
