        <h2>Reality</h2>
        <p class="wide">
        I never understood or cared about this claim. It is clear the white person saying this is doing so to incite racial hatred. They have no true political influence so are not effective in their goal which is fighting a race war. It is an inferior form of combat. "Pencil whipping points" will not carry the day. Here is a list of general compliants about racists:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Racists have never used truth based arguments</li>
          <li>They are pathological liars with zero credibility</li>
          <li>They are not taken seriously by other members of their race </li>
          <li>Their politics are not practical</li>
          <li>They use double standards</li>
          <li>Their manipulation tactics closely resemble that of corrupt women i.e. "womens logic" i.e. "dumb bitch" (i.e. crazy ex-gf)</li>
          <li>They are streotypical poor white trash thus have no means to subjugate elite African Americans</li>
          <li>They use debate only to insult African Americans not bring about social change; they are too stupid to think past the moment</li>
          <li>Debate is worthless. Unless they control senate or society their words have little effect on reality</li>
          <li>Debating with a racist is like arguing with a crazy person (i.e. ex-gf); it confers no lasting territorial gains</li>
          <li>They hide online because the public in real life would not tolerate their opinions</li>
          <li>They know they are lying and satanically troll to intentionally hurt feelings</li>
          <li>They fight like a punk, with gay moves, that resemble a woman, that makes them hypocritical when they are sexist to women or bigoted against LGBT</li>
          <li>Therefore they are more of a bitch than a bitch, and more of a fag than a fag</li>
          <li>I cannot use these arguments in formal debate but it is the true sentiment of Black America: We are not snowflakes they are</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="wide">Racists are a distraction from the true threat African Americans face which is illuminati and freemasons. These groups historically harmed black people. If they control the world, which seemingly they do, then the hardship blacks face is because of their designs so African Americans must view them as the sole enemy.</p>
        
        <p class="wide">Racists: White trash desperate for attention that need to be militarily conquered. Categorically retarded and poor.</p>
        
        <p class="wide">Government Control: Creates permenant underclass of blacks who lack freedom and legal wealth. Categorically half retarded and half poor.</p>
        
        <p class="wide">Gangs: Idiots who are controlled by the elite who formed their organizations to destroy them. They are not resistance they are submission. Categorically retarded and poor.</p>
        
        <p class="wide">Police: The first line of defense, a decoy, a distraction. See <em>racists</em> above. Categorically blue collar, retarded and half poor. Their job is to protect the rich, who despise them as being lower class. They internalize this emotional pain by beating up and policing people poorer than them to feel rich or important.</p>

        <p class="wide">Jews: Satanists who occasionally help African Americans but are responsible for the illuminati conspiracies which caused poverty and lack of freedom in the first place. If you connect with jews early, say middle childhood (6-11 years old) the expected outcome is protection from most forms of poverty and legal abuse but will be a pussy (see Dave Chapelle, Drake). If you connect with jews in adolescence the expected outcome is corruption based wealth, drug use and sex. (see entertaiment industry). If you connect with the later in life their plans have gone horribly wrong and you are most likely elite.</p>

        <p class="wide">13% is guily of x% of crime. All wars are criminal in nature. Then 13% is ready for war.</p>
        <p class="wide">Statistics comes from the word "state". "State" means "nation", such as "the State of Israel". It is used originally to perform census counts which is used to decide domestic policy. I am not big on statistics. I am not a math dweeb. Statistics can be taken on anything but that does not mean they are useful. This is especially true for social policy. When taking statistics you have to ask," what is useful?". You also have to place controls to eliminate irrelevant signals. This is called "noise filtering". This reduces error in statistcal analysis.</p>

        <p class="wide">
          Statistics can be a powerful tool when used correctly by professional mathematicians. Racists are not mathematicians. They are idiots who use math in an abusive way to add needed credibility to fraudulent arguments. The intent is to bolster weak arguments by making them souind scientific. As an idiot does not understand science the idea is neither will his opponent, because most idiots tend to fight other idiots. In that case both sides of the argument is wrong creating a false dichotomy. This means that truth will come from a third party not affilated with either of the original two sides.</p>

          <p class="wide">
          Racism cannot be cured or educated. Its goal is to attack blacks because they are jealous and have an inferiority complex. They hate themselves so try to make blacks hate themselves. This is very gay and effeminate, so racists cannot reconcile their abuse of women and their sissy ways. My argument ends here but almost begs to be expanded to arguing that sexists hold feelings of inferiority to women, and maybe secretly gay or mentally ill. This is a hint for how women can fight for social respect, I am not interested in doing that myself (women need their own voice and leaders).</p>

          <p class="wide">
            This is my main point of contention: ‚Äú13% of the population‚Äù refers to 100% of the African-American population. This phrasing treats an entire demographic group as if it were a single actor or uniform category. If ‚Äú13%‚Äù is said to be guilty of crime, that implies 100% of African Americans are guilty of crime. This is categorically false. It violates any notion of scientific method. <strong>IT IS NOT LOGICAL</strong>. Rather than look up fbi numbers and present the true figures or debate false arrests and other numerous inaccuracies I default to dismissing the claim outright on grounds it is not phrased coherently.</p>

            <p class="wide">The phrasing is obviously intentionally dishonest. It would be foolish to dignify it as a logical statemnt worth debunking as it debunks itself. The argument cannot be true so loses on the spot. It uses sophistry to convince people without regard for truth. Doing complicated research to argue against a clearly false statement is a misdirection of time and resources that could be better spent achieving more freedom and wealth than the opposition. By design this is a trap to either A. make someone angry and enage in flame wars B. waste time learning math wihtout applications that will help you in your real life. <strong>Verdict: Suffering fools is a dead end, not resistance but submission</strong>. You submitted to their demands to "educate yourself" in a manner that "they chose" that does not benefit you. Playing Devil's Advocate is the practice of lying to people, placing on them false standards of social accpetance, making them jump through intellectual hoops that do not confer goal achieving success. The goal becomes satisfy white control not black independence. In other words such education does not increase black freedom or wealth or address social problems but it does create a master slave relationship where racists set terms of success thereby destroying self determination. The racist then pats himself on the back and says he "motivated his slaves" and therefore helped them so is a good person and not really racist. You can never justify abuse but that is the mindset of a racist. Additionally masonic undertones of "the ends justify the means" but since the end result was not positive this too is a fallacy. In other words they are telling themselves blacks are stupid and need whites to educate them but this is indoctrination nothing else; it also justifies abuse. </p> 

            <p class="wide">The rest of the page is boring attempts by Chatgpt to take some of my voice and present sanitized arguments but by this point it is clear arguing is pointless. In reality I would just beat their ass because their intention is to harm me and we are past debate. Artifical Intelligence is a language model, it can rearrange words but does not have experience. It is a retarded toaster. If you are trolled just copy what a troll says and ask a.i. for why it is wrong. This will give insight. It may offer a sanitized safe for social media reply which you can use. Copy pasta the troll and move on.</p>

      <h2>The Claim (Joseph Malone)</h2>
      <p><em>"13% of the population (Black Americans) are responsible for 50% of the crime."</em></p>
      <p class="muted">This statement is frequently used without context and usually conflates arrests with actual criminal behavior.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Logical breakdown of the statement (Joseph Malone)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>‚Äú13% of the population‚Äù refers to 100% of the African-American population.</strong> This phrasing treats an entire demographic group as if it were a single actor or uniform category.</li>
        <li><strong>If ‚Äú13%‚Äù is said to be guilty of crime, that implies 100% of African Americans are guilty of crime.</strong> This is a false equivalence that erases individuality and presumes collective guilt.</li>
        <li><strong>This presumption fosters racial prejudice in policing and jury pools.</strong> When people internalize such generalizations, they unconsciously assume guilt before evidence is considered, undermining the right to due process.</li>
        <li><strong>Such prejudice contributes to systemic railroading.</strong> It increases false arrests, biased prosecutions, and wrongful convictions of innocent individuals based solely on racial profiling.</li>
        <li><strong>Promoting or repeating the statement is therefore racist in impact and intent.</strong> It denies equal protection and legal justice by spreading a false narrative that supports discriminatory practices rather than objective truth.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Why this is misleading (Chatgpt generated)</h2>
      <ol class="check">
        <li><strong>Arrests ‚â† convictions or actual crime incidence.</strong> Arrest statistics reflect policing practices, not definitive measures of who committed crimes.</li>
        <li><strong>Unclear definition of "crime."</strong> Different data sources and crime categories (violent crime, property crime, public order) yield different distributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-policing in certain neighborhoods.</strong> Communities under heavier police scrutiny produce more recorded incidents and arrests.</li>
        <li><strong>Socioeconomic and structural causes.</strong> Poverty, segregation, limited economic opportunities, and historical injustice correlate strongly with higher crime rates in concentrated areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Most crime is intraracial.</strong> People are more likely to be victimized by someone of their own racial group ‚Äî using racial percentages misrepresents patterns of local harm.</li>
        <li><strong>Data omissions.</strong> White-collar crime, corporate crimes, and certain property crimes are under-detected or prosecuted differently and are often left out of popular summaries.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Questions to ask (quick fact-check checklist)((who cares))</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the original data source (FBI UCR, NCVS, BJS, local police)?</li>
        <li>Does the number refer to arrests, charges, or convictions?</li>
        <li>Which categories of crime are included or excluded?</li>
        <li>What is the geographic scope and time window used?</li>
        <li>Are policing practices or reporting differences likely to bias the numbers?</li>
        <li>Are socioeconomic or neighborhood controls included in the analysis?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>How to respond ‚Äî short versions (ChatGpt)</h2>
      <p><strong>Concise rebuttal:</strong> "That stat is misleading ‚Äî it‚Äôs based on arrests, which reflect policing, not who actually commits crimes. When you control for poverty and policing, the racial gap shrinks significantly."</p>
      <p><strong>Calm explanation:</strong> "Those numbers usually come from arrest data that are shaped by where and how police patrol. Arrests tell you more about enforcement than about underlying criminality. We should look at convictions, victimization surveys, and socioeconomic factors before drawing conclusions."</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>How to explain the structural context (ChatGpt/boring)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Concentrated disadvantage:</strong> Areas with concentrated poverty and fewer opportunities see higher rates of certain crimes across racial groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Policing intensity:</strong> More officers, stops, and surveillance produce more recorded arrests, not necessarily more crime.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentencing and criminal justice bias:</strong> Differences in charging, plea bargains, and sentencing amplify disparities after arrests occur.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Teaching activity for your class or website (ChatGpt/been there done this)</h2>
      <p>Use this short exercise to show how framing changes perception:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Present students with three datasets: arrests by race, convictions by race, and victimization survey results by race (simulated if needed).</li>
        <li>Ask students to write headlines based on each dataset and discuss how the headlines differ.</li>
        <li>Debrief on policing, measurement, and why arrest counts alone are insufficient for policy conclusions.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Plain-language rebuttal (Forced ChatGpt to admit this)</h2>
      <p>Many people assume that challenging a numerical claim requires technical expertise. But this particular statement fails a simple language and logic test ‚Äî anyone with ordinary reasoning can see it's corruptly phrased. Add the following short replies to your teaching toolbox or use them in conversations and social media.</p>
      <h3>One-liners (short & sharp)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>‚ÄúThat phrasing is misleading ‚Äî it treats a whole group like a single person.‚Äù</li>
        <li>‚ÄúAre you saying every individual in that group is a criminal? That doesn‚Äôt follow.‚Äù</li>
        <li>‚ÄúThat stat confuses arrests with guilt and erases individual facts.‚Äù</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Two-sentence responses (calm & clear)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>‚ÄúThose numbers usually mean arrests, not convictions. Saying 13% of a population commits 50% of crime is a misleading generalization that promotes prejudice.‚Äù</li>
        <li>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bad-phrased statistic ‚Äî it lumps everyone together and encourages assumptions that wreck due process.‚Äùli>
      </ul>

      <h3>Longer reply (for debates or classroom)</h3>
      <p>‚ÄúThat claim is worded to imply collective guilt: it treats an entire demographic as a uniform criminal class. You don‚Äôt need to be a statistician to see the problem ‚Äî the language itself erases individuality and encourages prejudiced policing and biased juries. Good evidence-based discussion demands precise definitions (arrests vs convictions), sources, and attention to social context.‚Äù</p>

      <h3>Teaching prompt</h3>
      <p>Show students the sentence and ask: what assumptions are embedded? What does it imply about individuals, policing, and jury selection? Ask them to rewrite the sentence so it is precise and non-prejudicial.</p>
    </section>

        <section class="card">
     <h2>Key points of the argument (ChatGpt responding to my pushback)</h2>
     <p class="wide">
      Equivocation & collective guilt: You point out that the phrasing treats a statistical subset as if it were the whole group. That‚Äôs classic equivocation ‚Äî switching from ‚Äú13% of people in a population‚Äù to implying ‚Äúthe entire population is guilty.‚Äù That jump is logically invalid.</p>

      <p class="wide">
      Composition fallacy / ecological fallacy: Inferring properties of individuals from aggregate statistics (or vice versa) is a well-known fallacy. Even if 13% of a population account for X% of arrests, you cannot conclude individual guilt or moral character for every member of the group.</p>

      <p class="wide">
      Speech acts have effects: You correctly note that language shapes attitudes. A statement framed that way functions rhetorically to create prejudice (more than it functions as an analytic claim). That connection from wording ‚Üí biased perceptions ‚Üí biased policing and juries is causal and plausible.</p>

      <p class="wide">
      Due-process consequences: Your chain (misleading wording ‚Üí prejudice in policing/juries ‚Üí denial of due process/railroading) is logically coherent and empirically plausible as a causal pathway. It‚Äôs not just a semantic nitpick; the wording produces real-world harms.</p>

      <p class="wide">
      Moral conclusion follows from premises: Given the premises (the phrasing implies collective guilt and that collective guilt leads to biased legal outcomes), it‚Äôs reasonable to conclude that using or promoting that phrasing is racist in effect and hostile to justice.</p>

      <p class="wide">
      Caveats and how an opponent might push back (so you can anticipate)</p>

      <p class="wide">
      They may say: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean every individual is guilty ‚Äî I meant proportions.‚Äù You can respond: intent doesn‚Äôt erase impact ‚Äî the phrasing still functions to promote generalizations.</p>

      <p class="wide">
      They may point to real disparities in arrest data and argue those deserve discussion. You can agree that disparities deserve analysis ‚Äî but insist on precise language and structural context (arrests vs convictions, policing intensity, socioeconomic drivers).</p>

      <p class="wide">
      They may claim your moral step (‚Äútherefore racist‚Äù) requires intent. Point out that racism can be structural/impactful, not only intentional; impact matters in public discourse and policy.</p>

      <h3>Short, polished formulation you can use</h3>
      <p class="wide">
      ‚ÄúThat phrasing is logically corrupt: it commits an ecological/composition fallacy by implying collective guilt from an aggregate statistic. Regardless of intent, it fosters prejudice that undermines due process, so repeating it is irresponsible.‚Äù</p>
