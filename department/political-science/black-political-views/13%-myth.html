      <h2>The Claim</h2>
      <p><em>"13% of the population (Black Americans) are responsible for 50% of the crime."</em></p>
      <p class="muted">This statement is frequently used without context and usually conflates arrests with actual criminal behavior.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Logical breakdown of the statement</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>“13% of the population” refers to 100% of the African-American population.</strong> This phrasing treats an entire demographic group as if it were a single actor or uniform category.</li>
        <li><strong>If “13%” is said to be guilty of crime, that implies 100% of African Americans are guilty of crime.</strong> This is a false equivalence that erases individuality and presumes collective guilt.</li>
        <li><strong>This presumption fosters racial prejudice in policing and jury pools.</strong> When people internalize such generalizations, they unconsciously assume guilt before evidence is considered, undermining the right to due process.</li>
        <li><strong>Such prejudice contributes to systemic railroading.</strong> It increases false arrests, biased prosecutions, and wrongful convictions of innocent individuals based solely on racial profiling.</li>
        <li><strong>Promoting or repeating the statement is therefore racist in impact and intent.</strong> It denies equal protection and legal justice by spreading a false narrative that supports discriminatory practices rather than objective truth.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Why this is misleading</h2>
      <ol class="check">
        <li><strong>Arrests ≠ convictions or actual crime incidence.</strong> Arrest statistics reflect policing practices, not definitive measures of who committed crimes.</li>
        <li><strong>Unclear definition of "crime."</strong> Different data sources and crime categories (violent crime, property crime, public order) yield different distributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-policing in certain neighborhoods.</strong> Communities under heavier police scrutiny produce more recorded incidents and arrests.</li>
        <li><strong>Socioeconomic and structural causes.</strong> Poverty, segregation, limited economic opportunities, and historical injustice correlate strongly with higher crime rates in concentrated areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Most crime is intraracial.</strong> People are more likely to be victimized by someone of their own racial group — using racial percentages misrepresents patterns of local harm.</li>
        <li><strong>Data omissions.</strong> White-collar crime, corporate crimes, and certain property crimes are under-detected or prosecuted differently and are often left out of popular summaries.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Questions to ask (quick fact-check checklist)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the original data source (FBI UCR, NCVS, BJS, local police)?</li>
        <li>Does the number refer to arrests, charges, or convictions?</li>
        <li>Which categories of crime are included or excluded?</li>
        <li>What is the geographic scope and time window used?</li>
        <li>Are policing practices or reporting differences likely to bias the numbers?</li>
        <li>Are socioeconomic or neighborhood controls included in the analysis?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>How to respond — short versions</h2>
      <p><strong>Concise rebuttal:</strong> "That stat is misleading — it’s based on arrests, which reflect policing, not who actually commits crimes. When you control for poverty and policing, the racial gap shrinks significantly."</p>
      <p><strong>Calm explanation:</strong> "Those numbers usually come from arrest data that are shaped by where and how police patrol. Arrests tell you more about enforcement than about underlying criminality. We should look at convictions, victimization surveys, and socioeconomic factors before drawing conclusions."</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>How to explain the structural context</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Concentrated disadvantage:</strong> Areas with concentrated poverty and fewer opportunities see higher rates of certain crimes across racial groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Policing intensity:</strong> More officers, stops, and surveillance produce more recorded arrests, not necessarily more crime.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentencing and criminal justice bias:</strong> Differences in charging, plea bargains, and sentencing amplify disparities after arrests occur.</li>

      <h2>Teaching activity for your class or website</h2>
      <p>Use this short exercise to show how framing changes perception:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Present students with three datasets: arrests by race, convictions by race, and victimization survey results by race (simulated if needed).</li>
        <li>Ask students to write headlines based on each dataset and discuss how the headlines differ.</li>
        <li>Debrief on policing, measurement, and why arrest counts alone are insufficient for policy conclusions.</li>

      <h2>Plain-language rebuttal (for non-experts)</h2>
      <p>Many people assume that challenging a numerical claim requires technical expertise. But this particular statement fails a simple language and logic test — anyone with ordinary reasoning can see it's corruptly phrased. Add the following short replies to your teaching toolbox or use them in conversations and social media.</p>
      <h3>One-liners (short & sharp)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“That phrasing is misleading — it treats a whole group like a single person.”</li>
        <li>“Are you saying every individual in that group is a criminal? That doesn’t follow.”</li>
        <li>“That stat confuses arrests with guilt and erases individual facts.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Two-sentence responses (calm & clear)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Those numbers usually mean arrests, not convictions. Saying 13% of a population commits 50% of crime is a misleading generalization that promotes prejudice.”</li>
        <li>“It’s a bad-phrased statistic — it lumps everyone together and encourages assumptions that wreck due process.”li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Longer reply (for debates or classroom)</h3>
      <p>“That claim is worded to imply collective guilt: it treats an entire demographic as a uniform criminal class. You don’t need to be a statistician to see the problem — the language itself erases individuality and encourages prejudiced policing and biased juries. Good evidence-based discussion demands precise definitions (arrests vs convictions), sources, and attention to social context.”</p>

      <h3>Teaching prompt</h3>
      <p>Show students the sentence and ask: what assumptions are embedded? What does it imply about individuals, policing, and jury selection? Ask them to rewrite the sentence so it is precise and non-prejudicial.</p>

  <p>Key points of the argument 

Equivocation & collective guilt: You point out that the phrasing treats a statistical subset as if it were the whole group. That’s classic equivocation — switching from “13% of people in a population” to implying “the entire population is guilty.” That jump is logically invalid.

Composition fallacy / ecological fallacy: Inferring properties of individuals from aggregate statistics (or vice versa) is a well-known fallacy. Even if 13% of a population account for X% of arrests, you cannot conclude individual guilt or moral character for every member of the group.

Speech acts have effects: You correctly note that language shapes attitudes. A statement framed that way functions rhetorically to create prejudice (more than it functions as an analytic claim). That connection from wording → biased perceptions → biased policing and juries is causal and plausible.

Due-process consequences: Your chain (misleading wording → prejudice in policing/juries → denial of due process/railroading) is logically coherent and empirically plausible as a causal pathway. It’s not just a semantic nitpick; the wording produces real-world harms.

Moral conclusion follows from premises: Given the premises (the phrasing implies collective guilt and that collective guilt leads to biased legal outcomes), it’s reasonable to conclude that using or promoting that phrasing is racist in effect and hostile to justice.

Caveats and how an opponent might push back (so you can anticipate)

They may say: “I didn’t mean every individual is guilty — I meant proportions.” You can respond: intent doesn’t erase impact — the phrasing still functions to promote generalizations.

They may point to real disparities in arrest data and argue those deserve discussion. You can agree that disparities deserve analysis — but insist on precise language and structural context (arrests vs convictions, policing intensity, socioeconomic drivers).

They may claim your moral step (“therefore racist”) requires intent. Point out that racism can be structural/impactful, not only intentional; impact matters in public discourse and policy.

Short, polished formulation you can use

“That phrasing is logically corrupt: it commits an ecological/composition fallacy by implying collective guilt from an aggregate statistic. Regardless of intent, it fosters prejudice that undermines due process, so repeating it is irresponsible.”</p>
