      <h2>Introduction to Political Theory</h2>
      <p>
        This course explores the foundational ideas that shape governance, power, and legitimacy. From ancient philosophy to modern revolutionaries, students will analyze how societies justify authorityâ€”and how those justifications are challenged, manipulated, or overthrown. All classical models are contrasted with Malone Doctrine to reveal solutions that are  gatekept by the old guard. First students are given proper mapping of biased political systems that currently exist. Second students explore the Malone Doctrine which quite frankly is the purest distillation of profound fairness and legal clarity that the world has to offer.
