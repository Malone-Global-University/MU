    <h1>When did the transatlantic slave trade begin in America?</h1>
    <p class="lede">A concise overview and timeline explaining the beginnings of the transatlantic slave trade globally and its arrival in English North America.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Short answer</h2>
    <p>The transatlantic slave trade began globally in the <strong>mid-1400s</strong> (with European powers transporting enslaved Africans), and it began in <strong>English North America</strong> in <strong>1619</strong> when a group of Africans were brought to the English colony of Virginia (Point Comfort, present-day Hampton, Virginia).</p>

    <h2>Timeline & key points</h2>

    <div class="item">
      <h3>Mid-1400s — European beginnings</h3>
      <p>Portugal and Spain initiated large-scale maritime exploration and began transporting enslaved Africans to Europe and later to their colonies in the Atlantic. This is the origin of the transatlantic slave trade as a system linking Europe, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
      <h3>1500s — Expansion in Spanish & Portuguese colonies</h3>
      <p>Spain and Portugal expanded the trade across their American colonies, with heavy demand in places such as Brazil and the Caribbean to supply labor for plantations and mining.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
      <h3>1619 — First recorded arrival in English North America</h3>
      <p>In August 1619, about <strong>20 Africans</strong> were landed at <strong>Point Comfort</strong> (now Hampton, Virginia). They were captured by English privateers from a Portuguese slave ship and sold to colonists. This event is widely cited as the moment African slavery began in the English colonies that would become the United States.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
      <h3>17th–19th centuries — Growth of the trade and slavery</h3>
      <p>Over the following centuries the transatlantic slave trade expanded dramatically. Scholars estimate that more than <strong>12 million</strong> Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic; many millions more suffered through the broader systems of coerced labor and racial slavery in the Americas.</p>
