    <section id="slavery">
      <h2>1. Slavery (1619–1865)</h2>
      <p class="summary">Core grievance: the forced enslavement and commodification of African people — legally sanctioned and economically foundational for the colonies and the early United States.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enslavement and loss of personhood:</strong> Africans were treated as property, denied bodily autonomy and legal personhood.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic exploitation:</strong> unpaid labor produced vast wealth for slaveholders and the national economy while leaving enslaved people and their descendants impoverished.</li>
        <li><strong>Family separation:</strong> sale and transfer of family members destroyed kin networks across generations.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural suppression:</strong> languages, religions, and cultural practices were suppressed or erased.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal codification of racial hierarchy:</strong> laws and constitutional compromises (e.g., Three-Fifths Compromise) embedded racism into governance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="reconstruction">
      <h2>2. Reconstruction Betrayed (1865–1877)</h2>
      <p class="summary">Core grievance: broken promises of land, political inclusion, and protection — followed by violent white supremacist backlash and federal retreat.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unfulfilled economic promises:</strong> measures such as "forty acres and a mule" were not implemented at scale, denying Black families material restitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Political sabotage and violence:</strong> enfranchisement and office-holding were met by organized terror (e.g., Ku Klux Klan) that suppressed Black political power.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal withdrawal:</strong> the 1877 Compromise ended Reconstruction and left Southern Blacks subject to state-sanctioned discrimination.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="jimcrow">
      <h2>3. Jim Crow Segregation (1877–1965)</h2>
      <p class="summary">Core grievance: state and local laws enforced a racial caste system that denied equal access to public life, political participation, and economic opportunity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal segregation:</strong> "separate but equal" doctrine upheld segregation in schools, transit, and public accommodations.</li>
        <li><strong>Voting suppression:</strong> poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and intimidation disenfranchised Black citizens.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic exclusion:</strong> sharecropping and discriminatory labor practices trapped many in poverty.</li>
        <li><strong>Racial terror:</strong> lynchings and race massacres (e.g., Tulsa 1921) were used to enforce white supremacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Education inequality:</strong> systemic underfunding of Black schools limited mobility and opportunity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="civilrights">
      <h2>4. Civil Rights Struggle (1940s–1970s)</h2>
      <p class="summary">Core grievance: formal legal victories were met with entrenched resistance, violence, and covert repression.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resistance to desegregation:</strong> legal decisions such as <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954) often met with delayed implementation or outright defiance.</li>
        <li><strong>Police violence against protesters:</strong> nonviolent movements faced brutal policing and arrests.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic discrimination persists:</strong> postwar programs (e.g., GI Bill) often excluded Black veterans through local implementation and discrimination.</li>
        <li><strong>Surveillance and repression:</strong> COINTELPRO and other programs sought to destabilize and discredit Black leaders and organizations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="postcivil">
      <h2>5. Post–Civil Rights Era (1970s–Present)</h2>
      <p class="summary">Core grievance: new policies and institutional practices — criminal justice, housing, education funding, and voting administration — produced modern forms of structural inequality.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mass incarceration:</strong> drug policy and sentencing disparities led to disproportionate imprisonment of Black people and the growth of the carceral state.</li>
        <li><strong>Housing discrimination & redlining:</strong> systemic denial of mortgages, discriminatory lending, and segregation limited Black homeownership and intergenerational wealth.</li>
        <li><strong>Health disparities:</strong> unequal access to care, environmental hazards in Black neighborhoods, and higher rates of some chronic illnesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Education funding gaps:</strong> reliance on property taxes perpetuates unequal school resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Employment and wage gaps:</strong> hiring bias, occupational segregation, and pay disparities endure.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern voter suppression:</strong> purging rolls, restrictive ID laws, and gerrymandering can dilute Black political influence.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="cultural">
      <h2>6. Cultural & Psychological Grievances</h2>
      <p class="summary">Core grievance: systemic denigration, erasure, and misrepresentation of Black lives and achievements — with deep intergenerational psychological effects.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Negative stereotyping and media bias:</strong> persistent harmful tropes shape public perceptions and policy responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Curriculum erasure:</strong> incomplete or sanitized history in many school systems minimizes Black experiences and contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Generational trauma:</strong> the psychological and community impacts of long-term oppression affect health, trust in institutions, and social mobility.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of reparative justice:</strong> absence of comprehensive national reparations or restorative policies for slavery and its legacy.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="structural">
      <h2>7. Ongoing Structural Racism</h2>
      <p class="summary">Core grievance: multiple institutions continue to generate disparate outcomes along racial lines even without explicit discriminatory intent.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Criminal justice disparities (stops, arrests, sentencing)</li>
        <li>School-to-prison pipeline and unequal schooling resources</li>
        <li>Healthcare and environmental inequities</li>
        <li>Algorithmic and technological bias in hiring, lending, and surveillance</li>
        <li>Economic policies that fail to address historical wealth gaps</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="summary">
      <h2>Summary & Teaching Notes</h2>
      <p>In short, the grievances advanced by African Americans are not isolated complaints but a connected history of exclusion, dispossession, and unequal treatment codified and reproduced by law, policy, and custom. For teaching:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use primary sources (legal texts, testimonies, local newspapers) alongside secondary scholarship to show continuity and change.</li>
        <li>Assign comparative timelines to help students trace how specific policies (e.g., housing, voting, criminal law) shifted outcomes across generations.</li>
        <li>Include local case studies—housing maps, school funding records, and oral histories—to ground national patterns in community experiences.</li>
      </ul>
