Nowadays we would call Garvey a coon. At the very least he believed that whites would never accept blacks which is untrue. This was untrue when he was alive, and more so now. His leadership is non-existent and worthless. In the 1980's as a child, knowing as little as I did about him, I knew he was wrong and it made me angry. They used to mention him in passing during Black History month and probably still do. As an adult who researches black history critically it is 100% clear the man is a traitor to his people plain and simple. No real leadership. He is not for us. The world would have been better off if he had never been born. We need something better than a man who runs to the Klan for assistance to ship blacks to Africa to help solve America's "Negro Problem".  Without Du Bois there is no MLK, no 1965 civil rights act, no voting rights for blacks. Without Garvey the civil rights movement would have happened faster. Garvey is divisive and his influence is still felt today making unity more difficult. He planted seeds of ignorance that continue to block freedom and legal wealth for Africans.


Between W.E.B. Du Bois vs. Booker T Washington or MLK vs. Malcolm X, there is strong evidence that in each pair the two systems of thought complemented each other. Garvey on the other hand, his ideas have been proved categorically false over time and as much was visibly true during his life.
Garvey is probably the worst leader ever and rightfully erased from the books. He does not deserve to be listed. "Back to Africa" was both symbolic and literal. This ideology is not pragmatic or even desirable. If he wanted trade with Africa, that is fine, but his rhetoric was dangerous and extremely unbalanced. 


In June 1922, while in Atlanta, Garvey met with Edward Young Clarke, the acting Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. He believed that both the UNIA and the KKK, in their own ways, agreed on one fundamental point — that Black and white races should be separate. Garvey thought that by engaging the Klan, he could reduce racial violence against UNIA members and secure safe passage for Black people who wanted to emigrate to Africa. The Klan saw Garvey’s movement as helpful to their own racist vision of racial separation,  a “Black exodus” fit their agenda.


The reaction in the Black community was overwhelmingly negative: W.E.B. Du Bois and the NAACP denounced Garvey, calling him a “dangerous demagogue”. Critics said that talking to the KKK legitimized white supremacists and betrayed Black Americans still fighting for civil rights in the U.S.
Some of Garvey’s own followers were shocked and left the UNIA. This meeting, combined with accusations of mail fraud in connection with his Black Star Line shipping company, led to a decline in his influence. In 1925 he was imprisoned, and in 1927 deported to Jamaica.


Garvey defended his decision publicly: “I regard the Klan, the Anglo-Saxon clubs, and white American societies as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together.” He meant that at least the KKK was honest about their beliefs, unlike northern liberals who preached equality but upheld segregation in practice. MLK later called these "moderate whites" known to the black community as "Mr. Charlie", represented best as in modern times as "Charlie Kirk". This was strategic miscalculation as a tactical blunder that alienated allies and destroyed his credibility. He was consistently morally troubling as a man who believed in total racial independence.
