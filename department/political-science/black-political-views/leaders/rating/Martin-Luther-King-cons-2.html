  <h2>Comparative Analytical Profiles of Leaders</h2>

  <!-- Martin Luther King Jr. -->
  <section id="mlk-analysis">
    <h2>Martin Luther King Jr. (1929–1968)</h3>
    
    <h4>Historical Context</h4>
    <p>Leader of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement during segregation and Jim Crow. Operated in a highly repressive, racially divided society, navigating federal, state, and local pressures.</p>
    
    <h4>Moral Loyalty</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intent vs. Action:</strong> Advocated nonviolence, equality, and justice; consistently aligned actions with moral goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency Under Pressure:</strong> Risked imprisonment and assassination to uphold principles.</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence from Contemporaries:</strong> Praised for ethical consistency even by critics.</li>
      <li><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong> High</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Strategic and Leadership Wisdom</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Political Acumen:</strong> Mobilized mass support, negotiated with political elites.</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional Vision:</strong> Focused on long-term civil rights legislation, coalition-building.</li>
      <li><strong>Economic/Policy Literacy:</strong> Later in career emphasized economic justice (Poor People’s Campaign).</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Adjusted tactics depending on political environment and audience.</li>
      <li><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong> High</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Achievements and Limitations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Major Successes:</strong> Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, widespread moral influence.</li>
      <li><strong>Bitter Failures:</strong> Could not fully address economic inequality; limited ability to influence federal enforcement in some regions.</li>
      <li><strong>Missed Potential:</strong> Could have led broader economic reforms for racial equity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>External Threats and Constraints</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>FBI surveillance and harassment.</li>
      <li>Segregationist state governments and violent opposition.</li>
      <li>Socioeconomic structural inequality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Analytical Verdict</h4>
    <p>MLK was morally and strategically strong. His assassination cut short the broader economic and political reforms he had begun to envision. Had he survived, he likely could have expanded civil rights into economic justice, sustaining a long-term social movement.</p>

  <!-- Malcolm X -->
  <section id="malcolm-x-analysis">
    <h3>Malcolm X (1925–1965)</h3>
    
    <h4>Historical Context</h4>
    <p>Leader in the Nation of Islam and later independent activist advocating Black empowerment and self-defense during the Civil Rights era in the U.S.</p>
    
    <h4>Moral Loyalty</h4>

      <li><strong>Evidence from Contemporaries:</strong> Admired by Black communities; criticized for early militancy.</li>
      <li><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong> High</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Strategic and Leadership Wisdom</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Political Acumen:</strong> Charismatic and persuasive; skilled in mobilizing local communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional Vision:</strong> Limited formal governance plans; focus on empowerment and advocacy rather than policy implementation.</li>
      <li><strong>Economic/Policy Literacy:</strong> Moderate; emphasized community control and self-sufficiency but not macroeconomic planning.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Evolved ideology after pilgrimage; open to international coalition-building.</li>
      <li><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong> Medium-High</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Achievements and Limitations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Major Successes:</strong> Globalized Black liberation discourse, inspired community activism, challenged systemic oppression.</li>
      <li><strong>Bitter Failures:</strong> Short lifespan limited policy and structural influence; faced internal and external assassination threats.</li>
      <li><strong>Missed Potential:</strong> Could have built a sustainable, organized movement for political and economic empowerment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>External Threats and Constraints</h4>

      <li>FBI and surveillance, Nation of Islam internal conflict.</li>
      <li>Segregationist societal structures.</li>
      <li>Assassination risk from extremist factions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Analytical Verdict</h4>
    <p>Malcolm X was morally committed and highly effective at mobilization and rhetoric. His lack of institutional planning limited long-term governance potential, but had he survived, he could have evolved into a major political strategist and international human rights leader.</p>

  <!-- Kwame Nkrumah -->
  <section id="nkrumah-analysis">
    <h3>Kwame Nkrumah (1909–1972)</h3>
    
    <h4>Historical Context</h4>
    <p>First Prime Minister and President of Ghana, leading the country to independence from Britain in 1957. Advocated Pan-African unity and socialist development in a newly independent, resource-limited state.</p>
    
    <h4>Moral Loyalty</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intent vs. Action:</strong> Committed to African liberation and unity; personal accumulation of power occasionally conflicted with ideals.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency Under Pressure:</strong> Maintained focus on Pan-African vision despite opposition, though governance became increasingly authoritarian.</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence from Contemporaries:</strong> Respected internationally for independence advocacy; criticized domestically for power consolidation.</li>
      <li><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong> Medium-High</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Strategic and Leadership Wisdom</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Political Acumen:</strong> Skilled in independence movements and party-building; struggled with checks and balances.</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional Vision:</strong> Created institutions for education, industry, and Pan-African cooperation; centralized power undermined long-term stability.</li>
      <li><strong>Economic/Policy Literacy:</strong> Advocated state-led industrialization; implementation hampered by corruption and external pressures.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Limited; rigid ideology reduced flexibility in responding to internal dissent and external pressures.</li>
      <li><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong> Medium</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Achievements and Limitations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Major Successes:</strong> Independence of Ghana, Pan-African advocacy, public education expansion, infrastructure development.</li>
      <li><strong>Bitter Failures:</strong> Economic mismanagement, authoritarian tendencies, vulnerability to coups (eventually overthrown in 1966).</li>
      <li><strong>Missed Potential:</strong> Could have consolidated a stable, Pan-African economic bloc if institutional reforms and succession planning were implemented.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>External Threats and Constraints</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Western intelligence interference (alleged CIA involvement in coup).</li>
      <li>Economic dependence and limited industrial base.</li>
      <li>Domestic factionalism and opposition parties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Analytical Verdict</h4>
    <p>Nkrumah was morally committed and visionary, but structural weaknesses and authoritarian tendencies limited long-term governance. Had he adapted to build inclusive institutions, he might have achieved sustainable Pan-African leadership and economic development.</p>
