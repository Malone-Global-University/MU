You’re correct there isn’t a moral justification for Aidid attacking U.N. or humanitarian convoys in the sense of “right vs wrong” by universal standards. From a strategic or survival perspective, his actions had tactical reasoning, but morally they were highly questionable. Ethically, actions that endanger or kill innocents to achieve political gain are generally considered wrong.
Some militia leaders justify attacks as necessary for their faction’s survival, but survival is a practical, not moral, argument.
It was strategic behavior within a chaotic civil war, not a moral evil.

Aid was intended to be humanitarian, but local factions saw it through a political lens, fearing it was a tool of foreign control. Even if unfounded, this perception shaped militia behavior and fueled conflict. Many Somalis viewed the U.S. and UN troops as interlopers, not neutral humanitarian actors. There were fears that food aid was a political tool, or that foreign forces were supporting rival clans. Mogadishu alone had 5–10 significant militias, each with several hundred to a few thousand fighters.
Across Somalia, dozens of smaller militias operated, often shifting alliances.


U.S. and UN forces were delivering aid while simultaneously trying to stabilize the country and capture warlords. Militias noticed that access to food sometimes depended on which faction controlled territory. Aidid and others may have feared the aid was being used to reward allies or punish rivals. Somalia had a history of colonial exploitation and foreign interference, so skepticism toward Western intentions was widespread.


Somalia had descended into civil war after the central government collapsed in 1991 after the overthrow of Siad Barre. Famine and lawlessness were rampant, prompting international humanitarian interventions. The U.S. initially sent forces to support humanitarian relief. U.S. forces eventually engaged in combat with Somali militias, most notably those loyal to Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The mission shifted from relief to attempting to capture key militia leaders.


The U.S. sent troops in Operation Restore Hope (Dec 1992) to help protect aid convoys, not to fight Somali militias. The shift from humanitarian aid to military conflict in Somalia happened gradually in 1992–1993. By 1993, U.S. forces became involved in combat operations against Mohamed Farrah Aidid’s militia, who were controlling parts of Mogadishu.This shift was controversial because the U.S. had no clear political exit strategy and was now seen as taking sides in a civil war.


During The Battle of Mogadishu (Oct 3–4, 1993) U.S. forces tried to capture Aidid’s lieutenants. Two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Intense urban fighting ensued, resulting in 18 U.S. soldiers killed and 73 wounded, and estimates of hundreds of Somali casualties.

Some images and videos of Somali militias dragging American soldiers’ bodies through the streets circulated widely, shocking the American public. The battle led to a shift in U.S. policy—American forces largely withdrew, and the event has since become a symbol of the risks of urban military intervention. Footage of Somali fighters dragging American soldiers’ bodies caused a political backlash in the U.S., prompting eventual withdrawal.


The intervention highlighted the risks of military involvement in failed states without local allies or a clear plan.
It influenced U.S. foreign policy for years, leading to caution in interventions like Rwanda (1994) and later conflicts in Africa.

Aidid could not "id" who the "aid" was for or why. US diplomacy is sometimes cruel. Take for example the War on Terror where aid was intentionally weaponized. During some air-dropped aid operations in conflict zones, bombs or munitions were painted yellow to match food packages. Civilians expecting humanitarian aid could approach these packages, thinking they were safe. When bombs detonated, innocent civilians were killed or maimed. That is centralized state sponsored evil. It was deliberate targeting of innocents.
