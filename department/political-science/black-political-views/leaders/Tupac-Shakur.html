  <section>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Tupac Amaru Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, New York City. Raised in a politically active household, he was influenced by his mother, Afeni Shakur, a member of the Black Panther Party, and by the broader struggles of African Americans in the U.S.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Black Panther Background</h2>
    <p>Tupacâ€™s mother, Afeni Shakur, was a prominent Black Panther, and Tupac was immersed in political consciousness from childhood. The Black Panther ideals of self-determination, racial justice, and activism shaped his worldview and inspired his artistic and political expressions throughout his life.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Political Beliefs</h2>
    <p>Tupac advocated for racial equality, social justice, and empowerment of the Black community.

He also voiced Pan-Africanist ideas, emphasizing pride in African heritage.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legal Problems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tupac faced multiple arrests and legal issues, including charges related to assault and sexual assault.</li>
      <li>In 1995, he served nine months in prison for sexual assault before being released on appeal.</li>
      <li>He often spoke about how the justice system disproportionately targeted African Americans and how his legal struggles reflected broader systemic issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Illuminati Interviews and Conspiracies</h2>
    <p>Tupac claims that in Jail prisoners told him about the Illuminati and how they were causing his problems. He went on to make songs denouncing them such as "Killuminati". He stated that "Killuminati" means killing the symbolism of the Illuminati. This is a very profound and deep sentiment because you can kill a person but not their message thus making them a martyr. Killing the symbolism of a shadow organization effectively kills their message and erases their legacy.</p>
