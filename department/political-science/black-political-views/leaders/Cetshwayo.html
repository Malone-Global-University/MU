    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      Cetshwayo kaMpande was born around 1826, the son of King Mpande of the Zulu Kingdom. He grew up during a period
      of relative stability under Mpande's rule, but with constant awareness of both internal and external threats
      to the kingdom. Cetshwayo received military training and was groomed to succeed as a leader capable of defending
      Zulu sovereignty.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
    <p>
      Cetshwayo became king in 1872 following the death of his father Mpande. He inherited a disciplined military system
      and a kingdom threatened by increasing British colonial expansion. Cetshwayo focused on strengthening the army
      and unifying the clans under his command to prepare for inevitable confrontation.

    <h2>The Anglo-Zulu War (1879)</h2>
    <p>
      In 1879, the British demanded that Cetshwayo disband his army and accept British authority. He refused, valuing
      Zulu independence. Cetshwayoâ€™s forces achieved a historic victory at the Battle of Isandlwana, defeating a
      British column. However, the British regrouped and eventually defeated the Zulu army at the Battle of Ulundi,
      ending his reign.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Exile and Later Life</h2>
    <p>
      After the British victory, Cetshwayo was captured and exiled to Cape Town and later London. In 1883 he was restored
      to a portion of his kingdom, but internal rivalries and colonial interference limited his authority. He died in 1884.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Cetshwayo is remembered as the last independent Zulu king and a symbol of resistance against colonial invasion.
      His leadership showed a balance of military strategy, political authority, and commitment to the preservation
      of Zulu culture and sovereignty.
