  <h2>Maurice Bishop (1944–1983)</h2>

<p><strong>Maurice Bishop</strong> was a Grenadian revolutionary and Prime Minister who led the <em>New Jewel Movement</em>, a Marxist-Leninist organization that overthrew the government in 1979. His leadership brought widespread social reform, improved education and healthcare, and fostered grassroots political participation throughout Grenada.</p>
</section>

  <section>
<h2>Revolution of 1979: Overthrow of Eric Gairy</h2>
<p>Before the revolution, Grenada was ruled by <strong>Sir Eric Gairy</strong>, the island’s first Prime Minister. Gairy’s regime had become increasingly authoritarian and corrupt, relying on a feared secret police known as the <em>Mongoose Gang</em> to suppress opposition. His government was accused of election fraud, political repression, and economic mismanagement. When Gairy left the country for a United Nations meeting in March 1979, Bishop and the <strong>New Jewel Movement</strong> launched a bloodless coup. On <strong>March 13, 1979</strong>, they seized control of government offices and declared the creation of the <strong>People’s Revolutionary Government</strong>, ending Gairy’s rule and beginning a new socialist experiment in the Caribbean.</p>
</section>

  <section>
<h2>Rise to Prominence</h2>
<p>Bishop was born in Aruba to Grenadian parents and moved to Grenada as a child. He studied law in London, where he became deeply influenced by socialist and Pan-Africanist ideas. Upon returning home, Bishop co-founded the <strong>New Jewel Movement (NJM)</strong> in 1973, advocating for independence from neocolonial influence, economic equality, and social justice. His charisma and oratory made him a popular figure among workers, students, and rural citizens, propelling him to national leadership.</p>
</section>

  <section>
<h2>Political Achievements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Led the successful 1979 coup that established the <strong>People's Revolutionary Government</strong>.</li>
  <li>Improved literacy, healthcare, and housing programs across Grenada.</li>
  <li>Expanded access to education and launched mass political education campaigns.</li>
  <li>Strengthened Grenada’s alliances with socialist nations such as Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Soviet Union.</li>
</ul>
</section>

  <section>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite early success, Bishop’s government faced growing internal divisions and external pressures. Economic dependence on aid from socialist allies and opposition from Western powers strained the revolution. Tensions between moderate and hardline factions within the NJM intensified, particularly between Bishop and his deputy, <strong>Bernard Coard</strong>. Accusations of authoritarianism and economic mismanagement weakened the movement’s unity, leading to the 1983 coup.</p>
</section>

  <section>
<h2>Integrity and Governance</h2>
<p>There is no credible evidence that Maurice Bishop was personally corrupt. He lived modestly, maintained close contact with the people, and emphasized public service over personal gain. While critics accused the People's Revolutionary Government of ruling by decree and limiting press freedom, these were political and ideological disputes, not corruption scandals. Bishop’s honesty and humility earned him deep respect, even among opponents.</p>
</section>

  <section>
<h2>Enemies and Assassination</h2>
<p>Bishop’s main internal rival was <strong>Bernard Coard</strong>, his Deputy Prime Minister and a leading Marxist ideologue. Coard and his faction accused Bishop of betraying the revolution by becoming too popular and too moderate. In October 1983, Coard’s group placed Bishop under house arrest. Massive public protests erupted, and supporters freed him. Bishop and his ministers took refuge at <strong>Fort Rupert</strong>, but the army—loyal to Coard’s faction—attacked the crowd and recaptured Bishop. On <strong>October 19, 1983</strong>, Bishop and several colleagues were executed by firing squad. The coup shocked the nation and destroyed the unity of the revolution.</p>
</section>

  <section>
<p>Externally, Bishop also faced hostility from the <strong>United States</strong>, which viewed his socialist alliances with Cuba and the Soviet Union as a Cold War threat. His death and the resulting chaos gave the U.S. the pretext to launch <strong>Operation Urgent Fury</strong>, the invasion of Grenada on October 25, 1983, ending the revolutionary government.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>U.S. Influence and the Cold War Context</h2>
<p>There is no direct evidence that the United States planned or influenced Bishop’s death. The executions were carried out by his own comrades within the New Jewel Movement during an internal power struggle. However, U.S. policy toward Grenada contributed to the conditions that made such a split more likely. After Bishop aligned with Cuba and the Soviet Union, the United States isolated Grenada diplomatically and economically, portraying it as a potential “second Cuba.” This pressure deepened internal divisions within the revolution and heightened paranoia among its leaders. While the U.S. did not cause Bishop’s death, it quickly capitalized on the crisis. Less than a week after his execution, the U.S. launched <strong>Operation Urgent Fury</strong>, overthrowing the revolutionary government under the pretext of restoring order and protecting American citizens. Historians generally agree that Bishop’s downfall was an internal tragedy, exacerbated by Cold War geopolitics.</p>
</section>


  <section>
<h2>Aftermath: The Fate of Bernard Coard</h2>
<p>Following the invasion, Bernard Coard, his wife Phyllis, and other members of the NJM leadership—known as the <strong>Grenada 17</strong>—were arrested and charged with the murder of Bishop and his ministers. In 1986, they were convicted and sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment after international appeals. Coard spent 26 years in prison before being released in 2009. He expressed regret for Bishop’s death but denied ordering the executions. Today, he remains a controversial figure—respected by some for his intellect, condemned by most for his role in the revolution’s collapse.</p>
</section>

  <section>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Maurice Bishop remains a symbol of Caribbean independence, anti-imperialism, and visionary leadership. Many in Grenada and across the region remember him for his compassion, humility, and commitment to social justice. Monuments, schools, and annual memorials honor his contribution to Grenada’s national identity. Though his revolution was short-lived, Bishop’s ideals continue to inspire movements for equality and self-determination throughout the Global South.</p>
