    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      Shaka kaSenzangakhona was born around 1787 in the southeastern region of what is now South Africa.
      As the illegitimate son of a Zulu chief, he was raised under difficult conditions but quickly
      distinguished himself through exceptional discipline, intelligence, and leadership ability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
    <p>
      After serving as a warrior under Chief Dingiswayo of the Mthethwa, Shaka rose to command his own
      regiment and introduced major military reforms. When Dingiswayo was killed, Shaka united the Zulu clans
      under his rule and founded the Zulu Empire around 1816.

    <h2>Military Innovations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduced the <strong>iklwa</strong> (short stabbing spear) for close combat.</li>
      <li>Organized regiments by age and enforced strict discipline and loyalty.</li>
      <li>Revolutionized formation tactics with the famous <strong>‚Äúbullhorn‚Äù encirclement strategy.</strong></li>
      <li>Centralized command and developed the Zulu army into a highly efficient national institution.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Shaka transformed a small tribal confederation into a powerful African state. His empire inspired both
      admiration and fear across southern Africa. Though his reign was marked by violence and militarization,
      it also laid the foundation for Zulu cultural unity and identity that persists today.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Downfall and Death</h2>
    <p>
      In 1828, after the death of his mother Nandi, Shaka‚Äôs grief led to increasingly erratic behavior and
      harsh decrees. His half-brothers, Dingane and Mhlangana, assassinated him later that year. Despite his
      violent end, Shaka remains one of Africa‚Äôs most influential historical figures.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Successor</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>King Dingane kaSenzangakhona</strong> succeeded Shaka and ruled from 1828 to 1840. Dingane‚Äôs reign
      was defined by internal instability and conflicts with European settlers, culminating in his defeat by
      both the Boers and his half-brother Mpande.
