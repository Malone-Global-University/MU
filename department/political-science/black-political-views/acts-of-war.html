<article class="incident">
  <h2>Oscarville Massacre — 1912, Forsyth County, Georgia</h2>
  <p>
    In 1912, the prosperous Black farming community of Oscarville in Forsyth County, Georgia, was violently destroyed following the alleged assault and murder of a white woman, May Crow. After two Black teenagers were lynched—one publicly hanged and burned before a crowd—white mobs terrorized the county’s entire Black population. Over 1,000 Black residents were driven from their homes through threats, arson, and violence, effectively erasing Oscarville from the map.
  </p>
  <p>
    This campaign of racial cleansing resulted in the complete confiscation of Black-owned property, which was later resold or absorbed into white ownership. The land that once held Oscarville now lies beneath Lake Lanier, a reservoir completed in the 1950s. The town’s destruction and the forced displacement of its residents remain one of the least discussed acts of domestic racial terror in American history.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Casualties:</strong> Several killed, over 1,000 displaced, entire town destroyed.</p>
  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Ethnic cleansing, arson, forced expulsion.</p>

  <h2>Notes on framing</h2>
       The selected incidents above are widely documented and are presented here as deliberate attacks on civilian Black communities — i.e., acts of domestic warfare in their effects and intent (organized violence, destruction of property, mass displacement, and sometimes coordination with public authorities). This page is not exhaustive: many additional local incidents including burnings, lynch-then-burn operations, expulsions from counties and towns occurred across the U.S., especially from the late 1800s through the 1930s. For deeper research, consult local archives, state historical societies, contemporary Black-press reporting, and dedicated collections (National Archives, state archives, university research libraries, and the Equal Justice Initiative).
