    <strong>Notes on framing:</strong> The selected incidents above are widely documented and are presented here as deliberate attacks on civilian Black communities ‚Äî i.e., acts of domestic warfare in their effects and intent (organized violence, destruction of property, mass displacement, and sometimes coordination with public authorities). This page is not exhaustive: many additional local incidents including burnings, lynch-then-burn operations, expulsions from counties and towns occurred across the U.S., especially from the late 1800s through the 1930s. For deeper research, consult local archives, state historical societies, contemporary Black-press reporting, and dedicated collections (National Archives, state archives, university research libraries, and the Equal Justice Initiative).
