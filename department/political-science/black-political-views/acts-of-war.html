    <strong>Notes on framing:</strong> The selected incidents above are widely documented and are presented here as deliberate attacks on civilian Black communities — i.e., acts of domestic warfare in their effects and intent (organized violence, destruction of property, mass displacement, and sometimes coordination with public authorities). This page is not exhaustive: many additional local incidents including burnings, lynch-then-burn operations, expulsions from counties and towns occurred across the U.S., especially from the late 1800s through the 1930s. For deeper research, consult local archives, state historical societies, contemporary Black-press reporting, and dedicated collections (National Archives, state archives, university research libraries, and the Equal Justice Initiative).
