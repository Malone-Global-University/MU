      <p class="note">
         Adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
         sets out fundamental human rights to be universally protected. The UDHR contains 30 Articles.
         Articles 1–2 state the Declaration’s basic principles; Articles 3–21 set out civil and political rights;
         Articles 22–27 outline economic, social and cultural rights; Articles 28–30 cover community duties, limits, and implementation.
         Though not a binding treaty, the UDHR has been enormously influential, inspiring subsequent treaties, national constitutions, and
         international norms. Below is a compact, article-by-article summary that you can use for teaching, reference, or classroom handouts.
