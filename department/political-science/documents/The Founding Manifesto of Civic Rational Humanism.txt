The Founding Manifesto of Civic Rational Humanism
Preamble

We, the free and reasoning citizens of the world, affirm that liberty is the first condition of human dignity and that reason is the only reliable guide to its preservation.
Governments are instituted not to rule minds, but to secure justice, maintain peace, and protect the freedoms from which all prosperity and knowledge flow.

Article I – The Purpose of Government

The primary duty of the state is to safeguard law and order, defend the nation, and uphold the equal rights of all persons.
Government must be transparent, accountable, and limited—never a master, always a steward.
Its strength lies not in compulsion but in the confidence of its citizens.

Article II – Reason and Law

Emotion sways; reason steadies.
Therefore, all policy shall rest upon demonstrable evidence, open debate, and the rule of law.
The state shall not legislate morality nor enforce belief, for conscience is beyond its reach.
Justice shall concern itself with actions, not intentions, and fairness shall be the measure of all law.

Article III – Freedom

Freedom is the foundation of all rights and the engine of human progress.
No safety, profit, or convenience shall justify its surrender.
The only limits upon freedom are those necessary to prevent the destruction of another’s life, property, or liberty.

Article IV – Citizenship

Citizenship is an unalienable right conferred by birth or lawful choice, not a privilege to be granted or withdrawn.
Yet citizenship carries expectations: honesty in discourse, respect for the freedoms of others, and participation in civic life.
Government bears the full responsibility to defend the civil rights of every citizen equally and without exception.

Article V – Knowledge and Education

Education is the lifeblood of the Republic.
Its purpose is to teach reason, history, science, and the moral logic of freedom.
An educated citizenry is the surest defense against tyranny; ignorance is its surest accomplice.

Article VI – Economy and Justice

The economy exists to exchange goods and raise the standard of living through honest enterprise.
Capitalism, guided by fairness and opportunity, empowers individuals to create, trade, and prosper.
The law shall prevent exploitation and ensure that no citizen is denied the right to work, learn, or build.
Justice shall be both firm and humane, seeking restoration where possible and protection where necessary.

Article VII – Technology and Power

Technology is a tool of human progress, not a ruler of humanity.
No machine, algorithm, or system shall possess authority without human oversight.
Artificial intelligence, digital currency, and data governance must remain transparent, constitutional, and accountable to the public will.
Tools must serve the people—not monitor or command them.

Article VIII – Society and Culture

Family is the root of community; community is the root of nationhood.
Art and culture are mirrors of the human spirit and must remain free.
Religion and philosophy may guide individuals, but they shall not dictate the law.
Speech, even when offensive, must remain free, for truth is strengthened through contest.

Article IX – International Cooperation

We reject isolation and domination alike.
Through trade, science, and dialogue, nations can prosper together while remaining sovereign and free.
Peace is maintained by justice, not submission.

Article X – The Civic Oath

We pledge to build societies founded on reason, equality, and honesty.
We will oppose tyranny in all forms—political, economic, or technological.
We will educate, not indoctrinate; persuade, not coerce; and forever guard the sacred bond between freedom and truth.

Closing Declaration

“Let no government call itself just that hides its works from the people.
Let no citizen call himself free who will not defend the freedom of another.
The destiny of humankind is not submission, but self-direction guided by wisdom.”
