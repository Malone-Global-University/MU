      <h2>Lecture: From Bill to Statute; Treaty to Law</h2>
      <p>
        Congress passes laws through a multistage process: drafting, committee consideration, floor debate, passage, presidential action (sign / veto / pocket veto). Enacted laws are published as the Statutes at Large and later codified by subject in the United States Code (U.S.C.). For practical legal research, the U.S.C. is usually the starting point.
      </p>

      <h3>Treaties</h3>
      <p>
        The President negotiates treaties and the Senate must give advice and consent by a two-thirds vote. Once ratified, treaties are binding, but conflicts with later federal statutes or constitutional text may raise difficult interpretive questions. Courts often resolve such conflicts by considering the chronology and the intention of Congress.
      </p>

      <h3>Preemption and Limits</h3>
      <p>
        When federal law and state law collide, preemption doctrines instruct courts. Preemption can be <em>express</em> or <em>implied</em> (field preemption or conflict preemption). But federal laws themselves are constrained by constitutional limits — a federal statute that exceeds delegated powers risks invalidation by the courts.

    <section id="activity">
      <h2>Mock Bill Exercise (45 minutes)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Students are divided into small committees and given a policy prompt (e.g., regulate emerging technology X).</li>
        <li>Each group drafts a short bill (one page) with a purpose clause, operative provisions, and a brief note on constitutional basis.</li>
        <li>Groups present and floor votes are simulated; one bill is selected and critiqued for constitutional vulnerabilities and implementation challenges.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="homework">
      <h2>Homework</h2>
      <p>Find one federal statute relevant to your career interest. Prepare a one-page summary: statutory purpose, key operative sections, implementing agencies, and any known preemption or constitutional questions. Cite the U.S.C. section.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading rubric:</strong> accuracy (30), clarity (30), research & citations (25), analysis (15).</p>
