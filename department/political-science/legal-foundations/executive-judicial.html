      <h2>Core Content</h2>
      <h3>Executive Actions</h3>
      <p>
        Presidents use executive orders, memoranda, and proclamations to direct the executive branch. These acts must be grounded in constitutional or statutory authority; they are subject to judicial review if challenged.
      </p>

      <h3>Administrative Rulemaking</h3>
      <p>
        Federal agencies implement statutes through rules and regulations. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) sets procedures for notice, comment, and judicial review of agency action (students should consult the APA text in lessons).
      </p>

      <h3>Judicial Review</h3>
      <p>
        Courts evaluate the constitutionality of statutes and executive acts. Review includes assessing statutory interpretation, administrative deference doctrines (e.g., Chevron-style frameworks where applicable), and constitutional scrutiny levels (rational basis, intermediate, strict).
