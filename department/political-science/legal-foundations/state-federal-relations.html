      <p>
        Federalism splits authority: the federal government has those powers granted by the Constitution; remaining powers are reserved to the states or the people. State constitutions create state institutions and often protect civil liberties — sometimes offering broader protections than the federal Constitution.
      </p>

      <h3>Preemption</h3>
      <p>
        Federal law may expressly or implicitly preempt state regulation. Courts examine legislative intent and the field of regulation to determine preemption.
      </p>

      <h3>Cooperative vs. Dual Federalism</h3>
      <p>
        Historically, doctrines have shifted between a "dual" model (distinct spheres) and "cooperative" models (overlap and federal involvement). These shifts affect policy areas like commerce, welfare, and public health.

      <h2>Activities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparative brief:</strong> choose a state constitutional provision and compare how it protects a right differently from the federal Constitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Preemption analysis:</strong> present a hypothetical state law that conflicts with a federal statute and ask students to analyze whether preemption applies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="assessment">
      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Students write a 500-word analysis of a state law vs federal statute conflict and recommend likely judicial outcomes with reasoning.</p>
