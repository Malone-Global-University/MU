      <h2>Lecture: The Architecture of American Law</h2>
      <p>
        The American legal system is built from layers. At the top is the <em>U.S. Constitution</em>, which establishes the institutions of national government and sets the basic rules of the political order.
        Beneath the Constitution sit <strong>federal statutes</strong> enacted by Congress, <strong>treaties</strong> entered by the federal government, <strong>executive actions</strong> taken by the President, and the body of <strong>administrative regulations</strong> created by agencies to implement statutes. Parallel to these federal sources are <strong>state constitutions, statutes, and regulations</strong>. Finally, the judiciary interprets these texts; its decisions create the body of <em>case law</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>Hierarchy and the Supremacy Clause</h3>
      <p>
        The Constitution contains a Supremacy Clause that makes the Constitution, federal statutes, and treaties the supreme law of the land when they conflict with state law. But supremacy does not mean the federal government can freely act beyond its constitutional grants of power: every federal act must ultimately be traced to a constitutional source of authority.
      </p>

      <h3>Separation of Powers & Federalism</h3>
      <p>
        Separation of powers divides authority among legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Federalism divides authority vertically between the national and state governments. The resulting system balances dispersed authority with mechanisms for coordination and conflict resolution.

    <section id="in-class-activity">
      <h2>In-Class Activity (30 minutes)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Doc Sort (10 minutes):</strong> Give small groups 6 short excerpts (label them Constitution, statute, executive order, agency rule, treaty text, judicial opinion). Students classify and explain authority level.</li>
        <li><strong>Hierarchy Debate (20 minutes):</strong> Present a conflict scenario (state law restricts something that federal statute allows). Groups argue which law governs, citing the Supremacy Clause and potential limits.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="homework">
      <h2>Homework</h2>
      <p>Write a short paper (500 words) answering: <em>How does the Supremacy Clause shape the relationship between state and federal law? Provide one historical example where this principle mattered.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Grading rubric (50 points):</strong> Thesis & clarity (10), use of primary source (15), reasoning & legal logic (15), writing mechanics (10).</p>

    <section id="quiz">
      <h2>Quick Quiz (formative — in class or online)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Define the Supremacy Clause in one sentence. (2 pts)</li>
        <li>List three sources of federal law. (3 pts)</li>
        <li>True/False: An executive order can overturn a constitutional provision. (1 pt)</li>
        <li>Short answer: What is preemption? (4 pts)</li>
      </ol>
      <details>
        <summary>Answer key</summary>
        <ol>
          <li>The Supremacy Clause establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties are the supreme law of the land, overriding conflicting state laws. (2 pts)</li>
          <li>Any three: Constitution, federal statutes, treaties, executive orders, administrative regulations, judicial decisions. (3 pts)</li>
          <li>False — executive orders cannot overturn the Constitution; they are subordinate to constitutional constraints and subject to judicial review. (1 pt)</li>
          <li>Preemption occurs when federal law displaces or overrides state law in areas where Congress has legislated or where federal interests necessitate a uniform rule. (4 pts)</li>
        </ol>
