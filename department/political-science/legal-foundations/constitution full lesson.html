      <h2>Lecture: Reading the Constitution as Structure and Process</h2>
      <p>
        The Constitution is at once a legal document and a design manual. It sets institutions (Congress, President, judiciary), processes (how laws are made and how officials are selected), and constraints (limits on powers). When reading the text, move from the high-level design (Preamble and Articles) into the clauses that carry the institutional weight.
      </p>

      <h3>Article map</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Article I</strong> — Creates Congress and lists several enumerated powers; contains the Necessary & Proper Clause (a key enabling provision).</li>
        <li><strong>Article II</strong> — Establishes presidency: election, powers, and responsibilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Article III</strong> — Establishes the federal judiciary and grants life tenure to Article III judges.</li>
        <li><strong>Article IV–VII</strong> — States relations, amendment process, supremacy, and ratification rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Clauses to know</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Commerce Clause</strong> (Art. I, §8, cl. 3) has been the constitutional basis for much federal regulation; the <strong>Necessary & Proper Clause</strong> enables Congress to act through means reasonably adapted to its powers; the <strong>Supremacy Clause</strong> (Art. VI) ensures federal primacy where authorized.
      </p>

      <h3>Judicial review</h3>
      <p>
        The Constitution itself does not explicitly say "courts shall have the power of judicial review." That principle was established by the Supreme Court in <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> and has been central to constitutional enforcement: when a law exceeds constitutional bounds, courts may refuse to apply it.

    <section id="close-reading">
      <h2>Close-Reading Clinic (in-class)</h2>
      <p>Break into small groups. Each group receives a clause (Commerce, Necessary & Proper, Supremacy). Tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Paraphrase the clause in plain language.</li>
        <li>Provide one historical example of its use or controversy.</li>
        <li>List two interpretive questions judges face when applying the clause.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="primary-sources">
      <h2>Primary Source Assignment (before next class)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Read Articles I–III in full.</li>
        <li>Read Federalist No. 51 (Madison) and document the arguments for checks and balances.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="activities">
      <h2>Longer Activity — Drafting Exercise</h2>
      <p>
        Individually, write a 750–1,000 word memo arguing whether the Commerce Clause should permit Congress to regulate X (choose from: purely local commercial activity, internet data flows, or environmental emissions). Use textual, structural, and historical reasoning.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rubric (100 pts):</strong> Thesis & organization (20), textual reasoning (25), use of history & precedent (25), clarity & citations (15), mechanics (15).</p>

    <section id="quiz">

        <li>Explain the Necessary & Proper Clause and give one example of congressional action it has justified. (6 pts)</li>
        <li>List the three branches and give one core function of each. (6 pts)</li>
