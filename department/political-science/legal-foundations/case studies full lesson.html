      <h2>Core Case Studies</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Marbury v. Madison (1803)</dt>
        <dd>Issue: Does the Supreme Court have authority to review acts of Congress and executive action and declare them void if they conflict with the Constitution? Holding: Yes — established judicial review.</dd>

        <dt>McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)</dt>
        <dd>Issue: Can Congress create a national bank, and can a state tax it? Holding: Congress may exercise implied powers (Necessary & Proper), and states cannot tax federal institutions.</dd>

        <dt>Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)</dt>
        <dd>Issue: Scope of the Commerce Clause — does it include navigation and interstate commerce? Holding: Broad interpretation of commerce power for federal regulation.</dd>

        <dt>Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</dt>
        <dd>Issue: Is state-sponsored segregation in public schools consistent with the Equal Protection Clause? Holding: "Separate but equal" is inherently unequal in public education; segregation invalidated.</dd>

    </section>

    <section id="workshop">
      <h2>Case Brief Workshop</h2>
      <p>Students will be assigned one landmark case in advance. In class, each student delivers a 6–8 minute oral brief: facts, procedural posture, issue, holding, reasoning, and a personal critique. Peers provide one written question or challenge.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="assignment">
      <h2>Final Paper (capstone)</h2>
      <p>Write a comparative essay (1,200–1,500 words) analyzing two Supreme Court cases that interpret the same constitutional clause (e.g., Commerce Clause or Equal Protection). Evaluate doctrinal developments, the influence of social context, and likely future trajectories.</p>
      <p><strong>Rubric:</strong> thesis & originality (25), doctrinal accuracy (30), integration of primary sources (20), argumentation & style (15), citations & mechanics (10).</p>

      <h2>Sample Exam Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Explain the significance of Marbury v. Madison for constitutional governance. (10 pts)</li>
        <li>Compare McCulloch and Gibbons in how they shaped federal power. (15 pts)</li>
        <li>Short: Why was Brown v. Board a doctrinal and moral turning point? (10 pts)</li>

      <details>
        <summary>Suggested answer outlines</summary>
        <ol>
          <li>Marbury: established judicial review; allowed courts to enforce constitutional limits; consequently shaped balance among branches. Include discussion of remedies and separation of powers implications. (10 pts)</li>
          <li>McCulloch: expanded implied federal powers; upheld federal supremacy vs. state taxation. Gibbons: broadened commerce power. Together they created space for robust federal regulation in 19th–20th centuries. (15 pts)</li>
          <li>Brown: rejected "separate but equal" in education; used social-scientific evidence to show inequality; catalyzed civil rights movement and later doctrinal changes in equality jurisprudence. (10 pts)</li>
        </ol>
