      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe how a bill becomes law and where federal statutes are published and codified.</li>
        <li>Explain treaty-making and ratification procedures.</li>
        <li>Analyze how statutes and treaties interact with the Constitution and state law under the Supremacy Clause.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Core Content</h2>
      <h3>Statutes</h3>
      <p>
        Congress drafts, debates (committees), and passes bills. The President may sign, veto, or allow a bill to become law without signature. Enacted laws appear in the Statutes at Large and are organized by subject in the United States Code (U.S.C.). Agencies implement many statutes through rulemaking and regulation under administrative law frameworks.
      </p>

      <h3>Treaties</h3>
      <p>
        The President negotiates treaties; the Senate must advise and consent by a two-thirds vote for ratification. Ratified treaties are binding on the U.S. and carry the force of federal law, but their application can be complex when they conflict with federal statutes or constitutional text.
      </p>

      <h3>Supremacy & Preemption</h3>
      <p>
        Federal statutes and treaties preempt inconsistent state laws. Courts interpret whether preemption applies and whether state action is saved. Constitutional limits always apply—no statute or treaty can validly contravene the Constitution.

    <section id="activities">
      <h2>Activities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mock bill:</strong> students draft a short bill, walk it through committee and floor votes, and prepare a short policy memo explaining its constitutional basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Treaty case study:</strong> analyze an example treaty provision and test whether and how it would apply domestically.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="assessment">
      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Multiple-choice and short-answer exam on the legislative process, publication venues (Statutes at Large vs U.S.C.), and treaty ratification mechanics.</p>
