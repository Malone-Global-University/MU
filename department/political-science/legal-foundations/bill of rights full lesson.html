      <h2>Lecture: From Text to Protections</h2>
      <p>
        The Bill of Rights originally constrained only the federal government. After the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause became the vehicle through which most protections were applied to the states — a process called <em>incorporation</em>. This has profound effects: citizens can assert constitutional protections against state actions as well as federal.
