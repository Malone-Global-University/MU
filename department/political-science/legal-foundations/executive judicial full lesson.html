      <h2>Lecture: Executive Authority and the Administrative State</h2>
      <p>
        The President leads the executive branch and uses tools such as executive orders, memoranda, and proclamations to manage operations. For policy implementation, Congress often delegates authority to administrative agencies. Those agencies create regulations through a process outlined by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which normally requires notice-and-comment rulemaking.
      </p>

      <h3>Limits & Review</h3>
      <p>
        Executive actions and agency rules must be grounded in constitutional or statutory authority. Courts review agency action for procedural regularity and substantive reasonableness (e.g., arbitrary-and-capricious standard). Some doctrines provide deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes, while others require independent judicial assessment.

    <section id="simulation">
      <h2>Simulation: Rulemaking Workshop (60 minutes)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Students draft a proposed agency rule to implement a statutory mandate (one page).</li>
        <li>Class runs a mock notice-and-comment period (students submit "comments" and the agency writes a short response explaining changes).</li>
        <li>Wrap-up: instructor leads a discussion on procedural requirements and how a court would review the rule under the APA.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="judicial-memo">
      <h2>Judicial Memo Assignment</h2>
      <p>Write a 750-word memo advising whether a hypothetical executive order exceeds statutory authority. Use separation of powers principles and administrative law doctrines. Cite relevant APA standards and at least one judicial precedent (student-supplied reference acceptable).</p>
      <p><strong>Rubric:</strong> legal reasoning & structure (40), statutory interpretation (25), administrative law application (20), clarity & citations (15).</p>

    <section id="quiz">
      <h2>Quiz</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the Administrative Procedure Act (one sentence)? (2 pts)</li>
        <li>Short: Explain the concept of "arbitrary and capricious" review. (3 pts)</li>
        <li>True/False: An executive order can create law without any enabling statute. (1 pt)</li>
      </ol>

        <summary>Answer key</summary>
        <ol>
          <li>The APA is a statute that governs how federal administrative agencies propose and establish regulations and sets standards for judicial review. (2 pts)</li>
          <li>"Arbitrary and capricious" review is a standard where a court examines whether an agency made a reasoned decision based on the record; if the agency failed to consider relevant factors or provide explanation, the action may be set aside. (3 pts)</li>
          <li>False — while an executive order can direct executive operations, it cannot create law beyond constitutional or statutory authority; otherwise it may be invalidated. (1 pt)</li>
        </ol>
