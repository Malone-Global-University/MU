  <h2>Principles of Democracy üèõÔ∏è</h2>
  <p>Democracy is guided by core principles that ensure government by the people, for the people. These principles create a system that is fair, accountable, and protective of individual freedoms.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> Government derives its authority from the people, who exercise power through voting and civic participation.</li>
    <li><strong>Rule of Law:</strong> Everyone, including leaders, must follow the law, ensuring fairness and accountability.</li>
    <li><strong>Separation of Powers:</strong> Power is divided among branches (executive, legislative, judicial) to prevent concentration of authority.</li>
    <li><strong>Checks and Balances:</strong> Each branch limits the powers of the others, promoting accountability and preventing abuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Individual Rights and Freedoms:</strong> Citizens enjoy fundamental freedoms, including speech, religion, and assembly, protecting them from government overreach.</li>
    <li><strong>Majority Rule with Minority Rights:</strong> Decisions reflect the majority while safeguarding minority rights and perspectives.</li>
    <li><strong>Free and Fair Elections:</strong> Regular, transparent elections allow citizens to choose their leaders and hold them accountable.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Pluralism and Participation:</strong> Multiple parties and interest groups operate freely, encouraging civic engagement and diverse opinions.</li>
    <li><strong>Accountability and Transparency:</strong> Officials are answerable to the people, with transparent policies and decisions to prevent corruption.</li>
    <li><strong>Equality:</strong> All citizens have equal rights and opportunities to participate in government, fostering fairness and social justice.</li>
  </ul>
