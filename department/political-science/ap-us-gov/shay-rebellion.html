      <h2>Historical Background</h2>
      <p>After the American Revolution, Massachusetts faced severe economic stress, with heavy debt, high taxes, and a shortage of hard currency. Farmers, many of them veterans, struggled to pay taxes and faced property seizures and imprisonment for debt. Coastal merchants and creditors were largely protected, exacerbating social tensions. Under the weak Articles of Confederation, the national government could not intervene effectively.</p>
