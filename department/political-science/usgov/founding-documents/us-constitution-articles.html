<section>
<h2>Article II ‚Äì Executive Branch</h2>
<br>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">
 Article II establishes the President and Vice President, the branch responsible for enforcing laws passed by Congress. It defines their powers, duties, election process, and qualifications, ensuring a strong yet limited executive.</p>

<ul>
<li>President and Vice President serve 4-year terms.</li>
<li>Must be a natural-born U.S. citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the U.S. for 14 years.</li>
<li>Election Process (Original & Modified by 12th Amendment):</li>
<li>Initially, electors cast two votes for President; the runner-up became Vice President.</li>
<li>The 12th Amendment (1804) changed this so electors cast separate votes for President and Vice President.</li>
</ul>

<p class="wide"><b>Salary:</b> President receives a fixed salary, which cannot be increased or decreased during the term.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>Oath of Office:</b> Before taking office, the President must swear to faithfully execute the office and preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>Separation of Powers:</b> President enforces laws but cannot make them (Congress) or interpret them (Courts).</p>

<section>
<h2>Article III ‚Äì Judicial Branch</h2>


<br><h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">Article III creates the federal court system, establishes the Supreme Court, and defines the powers and jurisdiction of the judiciary. Its main goal is to interpret laws and ensure justice under the Constitution.</p>


<h3>Section 1 ‚Äì Federal Courts and Judges</h3>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Supreme Court:</b> Establishes the Supreme Court as the highest court in the U.S.</li>
<li><b>Lower Courts:</b> Congress has the power to create lower federal courts as needed.</li>
<li><b>Judges‚Äô Terms:</b> Judges hold office during good behavior, effectively giving lifetime appointments. This ensures judicial independence from political pressure.</li>

</ul>

<br>

<br>


<h3>Federal courts can hear cases involving:</h3>

<li>Federal laws and treaties.</li>
<li>Ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls.</li>
<li>Maritime law (sea-related cases).</li>
<li>Disputes between states or citizens of different states.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<h3>Original vs. Appellate Jurisdiction:</h3>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Key Concepts of Article III</h3>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Judicial Independence:</b> Lifetime appointments and salary protection prevent undue political influence.</li>
<li><b>Scope of Power:</b> Courts only decide cases and controversies, not hypothetical questions.</li>
<li><b>Checks and Balances:</b> Courts can declare laws unconstitutional (judicial review, established in Marbury v. Madison, 1803). Cannot initiate laws or execute them‚Äîthey interpret laws passed by Congress and enforced by the President.</li>
<li><b>Protection Against Treason Abuse:</b> Narrow definition and strict evidence rules prevent misuse for political purposes.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<section>
<h2>Article V ‚Äì Amending the Constitution</h2>

<br><h3>Purpose:</h3>

<p class="wide"> Article V establishes how the Constitution can be changed or amended. It balances stability with the ability to adapt to new circumstances.</p>

<h3>Methods of Proposing Amendments</h3>

<p class="wide">
<b>Congressional Proposal:</b> Amendments can be proposed by 2/3 vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This is the most common method.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>Convention of States:</b> A national convention can propose amendments if 2/3 of state legislatures request it. This method has never been used in U.S. history.</p>

<h3>Methods of Ratification</h3>

<p class="wide"><b>State Legislatures:</b> 3/4 of state legislatures must approve the amendment. This is the most common method of ratification.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>State Conventions:</b> 3/4 of specially called state conventions can ratify an amendment. Used once for the 21st Amendment (repealing Prohibition).</p>


<h3>Key Features</h3>

<p class="wide">
<b>Balance of Power:</b> Requires broad support at both federal and state levels, preventing hasty changes.</p>
<p class="wide"><b>Flexibility:</b> Allows the Constitution to evolve over time in response to social, political, and economic needs.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>No Limit on Number or Subject:</b> Any part of the Constitution can be amended except for the equal representation of states in the Senate without their consent.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>

<p class="wide"><b>Checks and Balances in Lawmaking:</b> Both Congress and states must agree on changes, ensuring no single branch can dominate the amendment process.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>Stability vs. Adaptability:</b> The process is deliberately difficult, but not impossible, balancing permanence with change.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>Historical Use:</b> 27 amendments have been ratified since 1789, including major ones like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bill of Rights (1791) ‚Äì first 10 amendments</li>

<li><b>Ratifying:</b> 3/4 of the states ratify the amendment, making it law in 1920.</b>
</li>

<section>
<h2>Article VI ‚Äì Supreme Law of the Land</h2>

<br><h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">Article VI ensures that the U.S. Constitution, federal laws, and treaties take priority over state laws, establishing the principle of federal supremacy. It also addresses oaths of office and prohibits religious tests for government positions.</p>

<h3>Clause 1: Validity of the Constitution and Federal Laws</h3>

<p class="wide"><b>Supremacy Clause:</b> The Constitution, federal laws made in accordance with it, and treaties are the ‚Äúsupreme law of the land.‚Äù State judges are bound by these, even if state laws or constitutions conflict.</p>

<h3>Key Idea:</h3>

<p class="wide">Federal law overrides conflicting state laws, ensuring national unity and consistent legal standards.

<h3>Clause 2 ‚Äì Oaths of Office</h3>

<p class="wide"><b>Requirement:</b> All federal and state officials must take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. This includes members of Congress, the President, judges, and state officials.</p>

<br><h3>Purpose:</h3>

<p class="wide">Ensures loyalty to the Constitution as the foundation of government, not to individual leaders or states.</p>

<h3>Clause 3 ‚Äì No Religious Test</h3>

<p class="wide"><b>Prohibition:</b> No federal officeholder can be required to adhere to or profess any religion. This guarantees religious freedom and neutrality in government.</p>

<h3>Significance:</h3>

<p class="wide">Prevents discrimination based on religion and separates church from state.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts of Article VI</h3>

<p class="wide"><b>Federal Supremacy:</b> Conflicts between state and federal law are resolved in favor of federal law.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>Oaths Ensure Loyalty:</b> All government officials are constitutionally bound to uphold the Constitution.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>Religious Freedom in Office:</b> Government positions cannot discriminate based on religion, reinforcing the First Amendment principle of religious liberty.</p>

<p class="wide"><b>Oath of Office:</b> Every member of Congress swears to ‚Äúsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.‚Äù</p>

<p class="wide"><b>No Religious Test:</b> A candidate of any religion‚Äîor none‚Äîcan serve in federal office.</p>

<section>
<h2>Article VII ‚Äì Ratification of the Constitution</h2>

<br><h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">
 Article VII sets out how the Constitution would take effect, replacing the Articles of Confederation. It specifies the process by which the original 13 states agreed to adopt the Constitution.</p>

<h3>Key Provisions</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Ratification Requirement</li>
    <li>State Conventions</li>
    <li>Immediate Effect</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ratification Requirement:</h3>

<p class="wide">
The Constitution would take effect once 9 of the 13 states approved it. This supermajority ensured broad support while allowing the new government to begin functioning.</p>

<h3>State Conventions:</h3>

<p class="wide">Ratification was done through special conventions in each state, not by state legislatures. This method allowed the people themselves, through elected delegates, to approve the Constitution.</p>

<h3>Immediate Effect:</h3>

<p class="wide">Once the required number of states ratified, the Constitution became the supreme law of the United States, replacing the Articles of Confederation.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why Article VII Was Needed:</h3>

<ol>
<li>The Articles of Confederation required unanimous consent of all 13 states for changes.</li>
<li>The Framers wanted a faster, practical method for the new Constitution to take effect.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ratification Timeline:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Delaware was the first state to ratify on December 7, 1787.</li>
<li>New Hampshire was the ninth state, ratifying on June 21, 1788, making the Constitution effective.</li>
<li>By 1790, all 13 states had ratified.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Key Concepts of Article VII</h2>

<h3>Practical Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Allowed the Constitution to take effect without unanimous consent, avoiding delays that plagued the Articles of Confederation.</p>

<h3>People‚Äôs Role:</h3>

<p class="wide">Emphasized that ratification is through state conventions representing the people, not just state governments.</p>

<h3>Foundation for Government:</h3>

<p class="wide">Article VII marks the formal beginning of the U.S. government under the Constitution.</p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Delaware: Ratified first, showing early support for a stronger federal government.</li>
<li>New Hampshire: Ninth to ratify, triggering the Constitution to go into effect in 1788.</li>
<li>All States: Eventually ratified, ensuring national unity under the new system.</li>
</ul>
