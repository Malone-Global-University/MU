<section id="overview">
  <h2>Overview of The Declaration of Independence</h2>
  <p>
  The Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776, announced the thirteen American colonies’ decision to break away from Great Britain and establish themselves as a free and independent nation. Written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress, the Declaration set forth the colonies’ grievances against King George III and outlined the philosophical foundation for self-government and human rights.
  </p>
  <p>
  The document consists of four main parts: the introduction (preamble), the statement of human rights, the list of grievances, and the formal declaration of independence. It remains one of the most influential political documents in world history.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="preamble">
  <h2>Introduction (Preamble)</h2>
  <p>
  The Preamble explains why the colonies are declaring independence and sets the moral and philosophical tone of the document. It begins:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  “When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another...”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  This section emphasizes the natural right of people to change or abolish any form of government that becomes destructive to their safety and happiness. It establishes that independence is not taken lightly, but as a last resort when justice and liberty can no longer be secured under the existing system.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="philosophy">
  <h2>Philosophical Foundation (Statement of Beliefs)</h2>
  <p>
  Jefferson and the Founders drew heavily from Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke, who argued that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed and must protect natural rights.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
  This statement became the moral core of American political thought, affirming equality and individual rights as universal principles, not privileges granted by monarchs or parliaments.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="grievances">
  <h2>List of Grievances</h2>
  <p>
  The largest section of the Declaration lists 27 grievances against King George III. These charges accuse the British Crown of violating the colonists’ rights and justifying separation. Among them:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws necessary for the public good.</li>
    <li>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing his invasions on the rights of the people.</li>
    <li>He has kept standing armies among us in times of peace without consent of our legislatures.</li>
    <li>He has cut off our trade with all parts of the world.</li>
    <li>He has imposed taxes on us without our consent.</li>
    <li>He has deprived us of trial by jury.</li>
    <li>He has transported us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  These and other grievances portray the king as a tyrant who ignored petitions, violated natural rights, and undermined colonial self-rule. The purpose was to show that independence was not rebellion but a justified act of self-defense.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="declaration">
  <h2>Formal Declaration</h2>
  <p>
  The final section proclaims the colonies’ independence, asserting that they are “free and independent States” with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, and conduct trade. It concludes:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  “And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  This solemn vow reflected the Founders’ understanding that signing the Declaration was an act of treason against Britain — punishable by death — but also a moral duty to secure liberty for future generations.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="impact">
  <h2>Legacy and Global Impact</h2>
  <p>
  The Declaration of Independence reshaped the political landscape of the modern world. Its ideas inspired revolutions and reform movements across Europe, Latin America, and beyond. Its assertion of human equality and government by consent became a model for democracies everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
  Even today, the Declaration remains a touchstone for freedom movements and a reminder that justice, equality, and liberty are universal aspirations.

<section><h2>Declaration of Independence</h2>
<article>
  <p class="wide">
   IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776
   The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united
   States of America,
 <br><br>
 
 When in the Course of human events, it becomes
 necessary for one people to dissolve the political
 bands which have connected them with another,
 and to assume among the powers of the earth,
 the separate and equal station to which the Laws
 of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them,
 a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
 requires that they should declare the causes
 which impel them to the separation.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
 men are created equal, that they are endowed
 by their Creator with certain unalienable
 Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and
 the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these
 rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
 deriving their just powers from the consent
 of the governed, –That whenever any Form of
 Government becomes destructive of these ends,
 it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish
 it, and to institute new Government, laying its
 foundation on such principles and organizing
 its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
 most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
 Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments
 long established should not be changed for
 light and transient causes; and accordingly all
 experience hath shewn, that mankind are more
 disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
 than to right themselves by abolishing the
 forms to which they are accustomed. But when a
 long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
 invariably the same Object evinces a design to
 reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is
 their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
 Government, and to provide new Guards for
 their future security.–Such has been the patient
 sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the
 necessity which constrains them to alter their
 former Systems of Government. The history of
 the present King of Great Britain is a history of
 repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in
 direct object the establishment of an absolute 
 Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let
 Facts be submitted to a candid world.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most
 wholesome and necessary for the public good.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws
 of immediate and pressing importance, unless
 suspended in their operation till his Assent
 should be obtained; and when so suspended, he
 has utterly neglected to attend to them.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has refused to pass other Laws for the
 accommodation of large districts of people,
 unless those people would relinquish the right
 of Representation in the Legislature, a right
 inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants
 only.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has called together legislative bodies at places
 unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
 depository of their public Records, for the sole
 purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with
 his measures.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has dissolved Representative Houses
 repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his
 invasions on the rights of the people.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has refused for a long time, after such
 dissolutions, to cause others to be elected;
 whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of
 Annihilation, have returned to the People at large
 for their exercise; the State remaining in the
 mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion
 from without, and convulsions within.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has endeavoured to prevent the population
 of these States; for that purpose obstructing the
 Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to
 pass others to encourage their migrations hither,
 and raising the conditions of new Appropriations
 of Lands.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has obstructed the Administration of Justice,
 by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing
 Judiciary powers.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone,
 for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and
 payment of their salaries.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and
 sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our
 people, and eat out their substance.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has kept among us, in times of peace,
 Standing Armies without the Consent of our
 legislatures.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has affected to render the Military
 independent of and superior to the Civil power.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has combined with others to subject us to
 a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and
 unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to
 their Acts of pretended Legislation:
</p>

<p class="wide">
 For Quartering large bodies of armed troops
 among us:
</p>

<p class="wide">
 For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from
 punishment for any Murders which they should
 commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
 For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the
 world:
</p>

<p class="wide">
 For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
 For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of
 Trial by Jury:
</p>

<p class="wide">
 For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for
 pretended offences
</p>

<p class="wide">
 For abolishing the free System of English Laws
 in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein
 an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its
 Boundaries so as to render it at once an example
 and fit instrument for introducing the same
 absolute rule into these Colonies:
</p>

<p class="wide">
 For taking away our Charters, abolishing our
 most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally
 the Forms of our Governments:

 <p class="wide">
 For suspending our own Legislatures, and
 declaring themselves invested with power to
 legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
 He has abdicated Government here, by declaring
 us out of his Protection and waging War against
 us.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, 
burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our
 people.
</p>

<p>
 He is at this time transporting large Armies of
 foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of
 death, desolation and tyranny, already begun
 with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely
 paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally
 unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken
 Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against
 their Country, to become the executioners of their
 friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by
 their Hands.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 He has excited domestic insurrections amongst
 us, and has endeavoured to bring on the
 inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian
 Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an
 undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and
 conditions.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 In every stage of these Oppressions We have
 Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:
 Our repeated Petitions have been answered only
 by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is
 thus marked by every act which may define a
 Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our
 Brittish brethren. We have warned them from
 time to time of attempts by their legislature to
 extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
 We have reminded them of the circumstances
 of our emigration and settlement here. We have
 appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,
 and we have conjured them by the ties of our
 common kindred to disavow these usurpations,
 which, would inevitably interrupt our connections
 and correspondence. They too have been deaf
 to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We
 must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which
 denounces our Separation, and hold them, as
 we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in
 Peace Friends.
</p>

<p class="wide">
 We, therefore, the Representatives of the
 united States of America, in General Congress,
 Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge
 of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, 
 in the Name, and by Authority of the good
 People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and
 declare, That these United Colonies are, and of
 Right ought to be Free and Independent States;
 that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the
 British Crown, and that all political connection
 between them and the State of Great Britain, is
 and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as
 Free and Independent States, they have full
 Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract
 Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all
 other Acts and Things which Independent States
 may of right do. And for the support of this
 Declaration, with a firm reliance on the
 protection of divine Providence, we mutually
 pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and
 our sacred Honor.
