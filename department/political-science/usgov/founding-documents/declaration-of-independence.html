  <h2>Overview of The Declaration of Independence</h2>
  <p>
  The Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776, announced the thirteen American colonies‚Äô decision to break away from Great Britain and establish themselves as a free and independent nation. Written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress, the Declaration set forth the colonies‚Äô grievances against King George III and outlined the philosophical foundation for self-government and human rights.
  </p>
  <p>
  The document consists of four main parts: the introduction (preamble), the statement of human rights, the list of grievances, and the formal declaration of independence. It remains one of the most influential political documents in world history.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="preamble">
  <h2>Introduction (Preamble)</h2>
  <p>
  The Preamble explains why the colonies are declaring independence and sets the moral and philosophical tone of the document. It begins:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  ‚ÄúWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another...‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  This section emphasizes the natural right of people to change or abolish any form of government that becomes destructive to their safety and happiness. It establishes that independence is not taken lightly, but as a last resort when justice and liberty can no longer be secured under the existing system.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="philosophy">
  <h2>Philosophical Foundation (Statement of Beliefs)</h2>
  <p>
  Jefferson and the Founders drew heavily from Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke, who argued that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed and must protect natural rights.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
  This statement became the moral core of American political thought, affirming equality and individual rights as universal principles, not privileges granted by monarchs or parliaments.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="grievances">
  <h2>List of Grievances</h2>
  <p>
  The largest section of the Declaration lists 27 grievances against King George III. These charges accuse the British Crown of violating the colonists‚Äô rights and justifying separation. Among them:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws necessary for the public good.</li>
    <li>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing his invasions on the rights of the people.</li>
    <li>He has kept standing armies among us in times of peace without consent of our legislatures.</li>
    <li>He has cut off our trade with all parts of the world.</li>
    <li>He has imposed taxes on us without our consent.</li>
    <li>He has deprived us of trial by jury.</li>
    <li>He has transported us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  These and other grievances portray the king as a tyrant who ignored petitions, violated natural rights, and undermined colonial self-rule. The purpose was to show that independence was not rebellion but a justified act of self-defense.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="declaration">
  <h2>Formal Declaration</h2>
  <p>
  The final section proclaims the colonies‚Äô independence, asserting that they are ‚Äúfree and independent States‚Äù with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, and conduct trade. It concludes:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  ‚ÄúAnd for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  This solemn vow reflected the Founders‚Äô understanding that signing the Declaration was an act of treason against Britain ‚Äî punishable by death ‚Äî but also a moral duty to secure liberty for future generations.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="impact">
  <h2>Legacy and Global Impact</h2>
  <p>
  The Declaration of Independence reshaped the political landscape of the modern world. Its ideas inspired revolutions and reform movements across Europe, Latin America, and beyond. Its assertion of human equality and government by consent became a model for democracies everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
  Even today, the Declaration remains a touchstone for freedom movements and a reminder that justice, equality, and liberty are universal aspirations.
