  <h2>Overview of Founding Documents</h2>
  <p class="wide">The founding documents of the United States were created in response to the political, social, and economic challenges facing the young nation. The <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong> was needed to assert the coloniesâ€™ freedom from British rule and to articulate the principles of natural rights. The <strong>Articles of Confederation</strong> established a first national government, reflecting the desire for unity while preserving state sovereignty. When its weaknesses became apparent, the <strong>U.S. Constitution</strong> was drafted to create a stronger federal government with separated powers and checks and balances. To explain and defend this new system, the <strong>Federalist Papers</strong> were published to persuade states to ratify the Constitution. Finally, the <strong>Bill of Rights</strong> and later amendments were added to protect individual liberties and adapt governance to the evolving needs of the nation. Together, these documents form the legal and philosophical foundation of American government.</p>
