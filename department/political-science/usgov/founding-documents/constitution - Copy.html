  <h2>Overview of the U.S. Constitution</h2>
  <p class="wide">
The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land and the outlining the fundamental framework and principles of the federal government. Drafted in 1787 and ratified in 1788, it is the world's longest-surviving written charter of government. It establishes three branches of government as legislative, executive, and judicial. A system of checks and balances is used to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. Composed of a Preamble, seven Articles, and 27 Amendments, the Constitution also defines the rights of citizens, with the first ten amendments known as the Bill of Rights.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Structure of the Constitution</h2>

<p class="wide">  The Constitution is organized into three parts: </p>

<p class="wide">The Preamble: A short introduction that outlines the Constitution's purpose, including ensuring justice, domestic peace, and the nation's defense.</p>

<p class="wide">Seven Articles: Sections of text that establish how the government is structured and operates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Article I: Defines the legislative branch (Congress).</li>
<li>Article II: Establishes the executive branch (the presidency).</li>
<li>Article III: Outlines the judicial branch (the federal court system).</li>
<li>Article IV: Addresses the relationship between states and the federal government.</li>
<li>Article V: Defines the process for amending the Constitution.</li>
<li>Article VI: Article VI: Establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land.</li>
<li>Article VII: Article VII: Describes the process for ratification.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="wide"> 27 Amendments: These are official changes or additions made since the Constitution was ratified. The first ten are known as the Bill of Rights and protect specific individual liberties guaranteeing fundamental rights like freedom of speech and religion. 27 changes have been made to the Constitution over time.</p>


<h2>Key principles</h2>
<ol>
<li>Separation of Powers: The government's powers are divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.</li>
<li>Checks and Balances: Each branch has the ability to limit the powers of the other two to maintain a balance.</li>
<li>Supreme Law: The Constitution is the highest law in the land, and no other law can contradict it.</li>
<li>"Living Document": The Constitution can be amended to adapt to changing needs, though it has only been amended 27 times in over 200 years.</li>
</ol> 

<p class="wide">Key features of the Constitution include "We the People" as its first three words declaring that the government's power originates from and serves its citizens. Separation of powers The government is divided into three distinct branches to prevent any single one from becoming too powerful.
Congress forms the Legislative Branch which is in charge of creating new laws. The President is in charge of the Executive Branch which executes and enforces laws. The Judicial Branch is led by the Supreme Court who interprets and applies laws. Checks and balances as a system allows each branch of government to limit the powers of the other branches. Federalism is the name of the method is which power between the federal government and state governments is divided. </p>

  <h2>1st Amendement</h2>
  <p class="wide">  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution is one of the most important parts of the Bill of Rights. It protects several basic freedoms that are essential to democracy. It reads:</p>

<p class="wide">"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."</p>

<p class="wide">In simple terms, it protects five key freedoms:</p>

<p class="wide">Religion – You can practice any religion or none at all. The government cannot favor one religion over another.</p>

<p class="wide">Speech – You can express your opinions without government censorship or punishment.</p>

<p class="wide">Press – Journalists and news outlets can report and publish freely, even if the government disagrees.</p>

<p class="wide">Assembly – People can gather peacefully for protests, rallies, or meetings.</p>

<p class="wide">Petition – Citizens can ask the government to change or fix problems.</p>

  <h2>🏛️ Origins in Colonial America</h2>

<p class="wide">Before the U.S. existed, the American colonies were under British rule, and many colonists experienced government control over religion and speech:</p>

<p class="wide">In England, the official Church of England was supported by law, and dissenters could be punished. The British Crown often censored newspapers, punished critics, and required government approval to publish. Colonists like John Peter Zenger, a printer in New York, were even jailed for criticizing colonial governors. His 1735 trial became an early symbol of freedom of the press, after he was acquitted for publishing the truth. Many settlers—especially Puritans, Quakers, and Baptists—had fled Europe seeking religious freedom. Their experiences with persecution deeply influenced early American views on liberty of conscience and expression.</p>

  <h2>📜 The Founding and the Bill of Rights</h2>

<p class="wide">After the American Revolution (1775–1783), the new United States adopted the Constitution (1787). However, some Americans worried that the Constitution gave too much power to the federal government and did not clearly protect individual rights. To win ratification, James Madison and others promised to add a Bill of Rights as a set of amendments guaranteeing fundamental freedoms.</p>

<p class="wide">Madison drawing inspiration from The Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776 drafted by George Mason), which protected freedom of religion and the press, Enlightenment philosophers like John Locke who argued that freedom of conscience and speech were natural rights, led to the First Amendment being adopted in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>⚖️ Early Interpretation</h2>

<p class="wide">In the 1700s and early 1800s, the First Amendment applied only to the federal government, not the states. For example The Alien and Sedition Acts (1798) made it a crime to criticize the government. These laws were widely condemned as unconstitutional, showing early debate over free speech. It wasn’t until the 20th century that the U.S. Supreme Court began using the 14th Amendment to apply First Amendment protections to the states as well.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🌎 Philosophical Context</h2>

<p class="wide">The First Amendment was influenced by Enlightenment ideas of liberty, reason, and the social contract, Republican ideals of open debate as necessary for self-government, and the fear of tyranny, especially from state-imposed religion or censorship.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Historical Interpretations</h2>
    <h3>⚖️ I. Early Cases (1800s – Early 1900s): Limited Free Speech</h3>

<p class="wide">For much of U.S. history, the courts gave narrow protection to speech.
Alien and Sedition Acts (1798) made it illegal to criticize the federal government. These were extremely controversial but predated Supreme Court involvement in free speech cases. During the Civil War Era dissent was often suppressed. Abraham Lincoln even suspended habeas corpus to detain critics of the Union. The First Amendment had not yet been fully tested in court.</p>

<h3>🗣️ II. World War I Era (1917–1919): The Birth of Modern Free Speech Law</h3>

<p class="wide">The first major cases came during World War I, when the government jailed antiwar activists under the Espionage Act.</p>


<h3>🔹 Schenck v. United States (1919)</h3>

<p class="wide">Socialist Charles Schenck was convicted for distributing leaflets opposing the draft.</p>

<p class="wide">Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the famous line:</p>

<p class="wide">“The question is whether the words are used in such circumstances as to create a clear and present danger...”</p>

<p class="wide">The Court upheld his conviction by limiting speech that posed a “clear and present danger” to national security.</p>

<h3>🔹 Abrams v. United States (1919)</h3>

<p class="wide">Russian immigrants distributed leaflets criticizing U.S. troops in Russia. Holmes dissented, arguing for “free trade in ideas”, laying groundwork for stronger protections later.</p>

<h3>📰 III. Mid-20th Century: Expanding Free Expression</h3>

<p class="wide">As democracy matured, the Court began strongly protecting dissent.</p>

<h3>🔹 West Virginia v. Barnette (1943)</h3>

<p class="wide">Students could not be forced to salute the flag. Justice Jackson: “No official... can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.”</p>

<h3>🔹 New York Times v. Sullivan (1964)</h3>

<p class="wide">This is a landmark case protecting the free press. Public officials cannot sue for libel unless a statement is made with “actual malice” — knowing falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth. This case solidified freedom of the press to criticize government officials.</p>

<h3>🔹 Tinker v. Des Moines (1969)</h3>

<p class="wide">Students wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The Court ruled students do not lose their rights at school, unless their expression disrupts education.</p>

<h3>🏛️ IV. Religion: Establishment & Free Exercise</h3>

<p class="wide"> The First Amendment contains two religion clauses. The Establishment Clause says government cannot establish an official religion. The Free Exercise Clause says you can practice your faith freely.</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>🔹 Engel v. Vitale (1962):  School prayer banned in public schools.</li>
<li>🔹 Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972):  Amish parents could withdraw children from public school after 8th grade.</li>
<li>🔹 Employment Division v. Smith (1990): The Court allowed Oregon to deny benefits to workers fired for using peyote in religious rituals (later led to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993).</li>
</ul>

<h3>💻 V. Modern & Digital Era (2000s–Today)</h3>

<p class="wide">Free speech law now extends to the internet, social media, and symbolic acts.</p>

<h3>🔹 Citizens United v. FEC (2010)</h3>

<p class="wide">Corporations and unions have a First Amendment right to spend money on political speech. This is highly controversial with critics saying it gives money too much influence in politics.</p>


<h3>🔹 Snyder v. Phelps (2011)</h3>

<p class="wide">Westboro Baptist Church’s hateful protests at military funerals were protected as free speech, since they addressed public issues.</p>

<h3>🔹 Matal v. Tam (2017)</h3>

<p class="wide">
The Court ruled that the government can’t deny trademarks for being “offensive”  “Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but... the proudest boast of our free speech law is that we protect the freedom to express the thought that we hate.”</p>

<h3>🔹 Packingham v. North Carolina (2017)</h3>

<p class="wide">Social media recognized as a modern public square; states cannot broadly ban people (even ex-felons) from using it.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🕊️ In Summary:</h2>

<p class="wide">The Supreme Court’s interpretation of the First Amendment has evolved from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limited protection (early 1900s)</li>
<li>→ Robust protection for dissent and the press (mid-1900s)</li>
<li>→ Complex debates about religion, campaign finance, and the internet (2000s–today)</li>
</ul>
