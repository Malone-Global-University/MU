<p class="wide">
Article II, Section 2 gives the President significant executive authority, but carefully balanced with Senate oversight, Congressional powers, and constitutional limits.</p>

<p class="wide">Article II, Section 2 establishes the President as chief military officer, chief diplomat, and chief administrator, while ensuring accountability through Senate confirmation, Congress, and constitutional limits.
It embodies the balance between strength and restraint in the executive branch.</p>
