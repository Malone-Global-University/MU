🇺🇸 Article VII — Ratification
📜 Full Text

“The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.”

🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown
1. Ratification Requirement

The Constitution became effective once nine of the thirteen states ratified it.

Not all thirteen states were needed initially; nine states provided a legal majority to establish the government.

📘 Purpose:

Allowed the Constitution to take effect quickly, while still encouraging eventual ratification by all states.

Ensured a strong and functioning federal government from the outset.

2. Conventions

Ratification was to occur through state conventions, not state legislatures.

This allowed the people’s representatives to directly debate and approve the Constitution.

📘 Purpose:

Ensured popular legitimacy of the new Constitution.

Avoided potential obstruction by state legislatures opposed to central authority.
