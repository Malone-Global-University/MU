      <h2>Section 1: Full Faith and Credit</h2>
      <p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Original Wording)</p>
      <p class="wide"><em>

“Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.”</em></p>

<section>
  <h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2><br>
  
  <h3>1. Full Faith and Credit</h3>

    States must recognize the laws, records, and court decisions of other states.
    Example: A marriage or divorce valid in one state is valid in all states.
    Example: Court judgments in one state can be enforced in another state.
  </p>

  <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>

  <p class="wide">
    Promotes legal unity and consistency across the nation.
    Prevents conflicts between state laws that could undermine national cohesion.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Congressional Role</h3>
  <p class="wide">
    Congress can pass laws specifying how acts, records, and proceedings are proved and what legal effect they carry.
    Provides flexibility to implement uniform procedures for interstate recognition.
  </p>

  <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>

  <p class="wide">Ensures that legal processes are standardized when applying one state’s laws in another.</p>

  <h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>

  <p class="wide">
Article IV, Section 1 ensures that laws, records, and court decisions are respected across all states, promoting legal continuity, fairness, and national unity. It balances state sovereignty with the needs of a unified nation.
