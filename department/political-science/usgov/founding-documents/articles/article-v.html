      <h2>Article V: Amendments</h2>
      <p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Summarized)</p>
      <h3>Proposal of Amendments</h3>
      <p class="wide">Amendments can be proposed in two ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>By Congress, with two-thirds vote in both Houses.</li>
        <li>By a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.</li>
      </ol><br>

      <h3>Ratification of Amendments</h3>
      <p class="wide">
        Proposed amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the states.
        Ratification can be done by state legislatures or state conventions, as Congress decides.</p>

        <h3>Limits on Amendments</h3>

        <p class="wide">No state can be deprived of equal representation in the Senate without its consent. Originally, no amendment could affect the first and fourth clauses of Article I, Section 9 prior to 1808 (related to slavery and taxes on importation).</p>
        </section>

            <h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2><br>
              <h3>1. Proposal</h3>

              <p class="wide">
                Congress or a national convention of states can propose amendments. The two-thirds requirement ensures that changes reflect broad consensus, not fleeting political trends.
              </p>

                <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
                <p class="wide">Allows for constitutional evolution while maintaining stability.</p>

                <h3>2. Ratification</h3>
                <p class="wide">
                  To become law, amendments must be approved by three-fourths of states, ensuring wide agreement across the nation. Ratification can occur through state legislatures or conventions, giving flexibility to states.
                </p>


                <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>

                <p class="wide">
                  Balances federal authority with state sovereignty.
                  Prevents a small minority from imposing changes on the majority.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Limits</h3>

                <p class="wide">
                  Equal Senate representation cannot be altered without a state’s consent — preserves federal balance. Original slavery-related limits show historical compromises, though most were later superseded by amendments (13th, 14th, 15th).
                </p>

                <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>

                <p class="wide">
                Protects critical structural elements of the Constitution.
                This ensures core federal principles remain stable.
              </p>

              <h3>⚖️ Philosophical and Constitutional Significance</h3>

              <table>
                <tr>
                  <th>Feature</th>
                  <th>Purpose / Reasoning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Proposal mechanisms</td>
                  <td>Ensures broad consensus for amendments</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Ratification process</td>
                  <td>Protects states’ voice and federalism</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Limits on amendment</td>
                  <td>Preserves critical structural elements of government</td>
                </tr>
              </table><br>

              <h3>📘 Core Idea:</h3>

              <p class="wide">
                Article V establishes a careful, deliberate process for amending the Constitution, allowing adaptation over time while protecting essential principles and state equality.
              </p>


              <h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>

              <p class="wide">
                Framers recognized the need for a living Constitution but feared hasty changes. The two-step process ensures national debate and state participation. The Senate representation clause preserved small states’ influence, addressing a key compromise during the Constitutional Convention.
              </p>


              <h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>

              <p class="wide">
                Article V provides a structured method for amending the Constitution, requiring broad support across Congress and the states. It balances flexibility and stability, ensuring the Constitution can evolve while protecting its core principles and federal structure.
              </p>
