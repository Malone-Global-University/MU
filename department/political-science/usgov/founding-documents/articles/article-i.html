    	<h2>Section 1: Legislative Power</h2>
    	<p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Original Wording)</p>
    	<h3><em>"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, 
	which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.”</em></h3>
</section>

<section>
<h2>🧩 Plain Meaning</h2><br>

<h3>This section establishes who makes the laws in the federal government:</h3>
<p class="wide">
	“All legislative Powers herein granted” means Congress only 
	has the powers the Constitution specifically gives it (no more).</p>

<p class="wide">“Shall be vested in a Congress” means all federal lawmaking power
				 belongs to Congress, not to the President or the Courts.</p>

<p class="wide">“Which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives” means Congress is bicameral consisting of two chambers designed to balance the interests of the people and the states.</p>


<h3>🏛️ Purpose and Design</h3>

<p class="wide">
The Founding Fathers created a two-house legislature to prevent tyranny and hasty lawmaking:</p>


<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Chamber</th>
		<th>Represents</th>
		<th>Term Length</th>
		<th>Selection (Original)</th>
		<th>Design</th>
		<th>Purpose</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>House of Representatives</td>
		<td>The People (by population)</td>
		<td>2 years</td>
		<td>Direct election by citizens</td>
		<td>Responsive and dynamic</td>
		<td>Reflects public opinion</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Senate</td>
		<td>The States (2 per state)</td>
		<td>6 years</td>
		<td>Chosen by state legislatures (until 17th Amendment)</td>
		<td>Stable and deliberate</td>
		<td>Checks popular passions</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p class="wide">This dual system was a compromise between large and small states at the Constitutional Convention of 1787.</p>

<h3>⚖️ Principle of Separation of Powers</h3>

<p class="wide">Section 1 firmly separates lawmaking from the other branches:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Legislative Branch (Congress) makes laws.</li>
	<li>Executive Branch (President) enforces laws.</li>
	<li>Judicial Branch (Courts) interprets laws.</li>
</ul>


<p class="wide">This separation prevents the concentration of power in one branch
as a core idea borrowed from Montesquieu’s “Spirit of the Laws.”</p>



<h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>

<p class="wide">
Under the Articles of Confederation there was no separate executive or judiciary, only a weak single-chamber legislature.
The framers saw this as ineffective so they designed a stronger but carefully limited legislature divided into two houses.</p>


<h3>🔍 Key Interpretations</h3>

<p class="wide">
“Herein granted”: Congress’s powers are enumerated (explicitly listed in Article I, Section 8).</p>

<p class="wide">
Implied Powers Doctrine (via the “Necessary and Proper” Clause in Section 8): Although powers are listed, Congress can take actions reasonably related to those powers.</p>

<p class="wide">Courts often cite this section to invalidate executive or judicial overreach into legislative authority.</p>

<h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>

<p class="wide">
Article I, Section 1 defines the most fundamental principle of American government which is laws must come from elected representatives, not from monarchs, judges, or bureaucrats. It sets the stage for all that follows by making clear the details of who represents, how they’re chosen, what powers they have, and what limits they face.</p>

<h2>Section 2: The House of Representatives</h2>
<p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Original Wording)</p>
<h3>Clause 1:</h3>
<p class="wide">The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.</p>

<h3>Clause 2:</h3>
<p class="wide">No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.</p>

<h3>Clause 3: [Superseded by the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2]</h3>

<p class="wide">
Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New-Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.</p>

<p class="wide">The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2>
<br>
		<h3>Clause 1 — Election and Qualifications:</h3>
		<p class="wide">Representatives are elected every two years directly by the people.</p>
		<p class="wide">Voters (“Electors”) must meet the same qualifications as those voting for the larger house of their own state legislature (i.e., typically the state’s lower house).</p>
		<p class="wide">This ties federal representation to state-defined voter rights (at least until later voting-rights amendments).</p>


		<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
		<p class="wide">To make the House the most responsive and accountable branch members must face the voters frequently.</p>

		<h3>Clause 2 — Eligibility to Serve</h3>
		<p class="wide">A Representative must:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Be at least 25 years old</li>
			<li>Have been a U.S. citizen for 7 years</li>
			<li>Live in the state they represent (though not necessarily the same district)</li>
		</ol><br>

		<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
		<p class="wide">Ensure members are mature, loyal to the U.S., and familiar with their state’s interests.</p>
		
		<h3>Clause 3 — Apportionment and the Three-Fifths Compromise</h3>
		<p class="wide">Originally, representation (and direct taxation) was based on a state’s population, counting:</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>Free persons fully,</li>
		<li>“Three-fifths of all other persons” (enslaved individuals),</li>
		<li>Excluding “Indians not taxed.”</li>
	</ul>

		<p class="wide">This was the Three-Fifths Compromise, balancing power between slave and free states.
		The 14th Amendment (1868) abolished this formula and replaced it with full representation for all persons.</p>


		<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>

		<p class="wide">To balance representation among states larger populations 
		get more representatives, but every state has at least one.</p>

		<p class="wide">Also establishes the Census, to be conducted every 10 years, determining how seats are apportioned.</p>
		<h3>Clause 4 — Filling Vacancies</h3>
		<p class="wide">If a seat becomes vacant, the state governor (executive authority) must call a special election to fill it. There is no federal appointment; vacancies are always filled by the people.</p>

			<h3>Clause 5 — Leadership and Impeachment</h3>

			<p class="wide">The House chooses its Speaker (currently the presiding officer).</p>
			<p class="wide">The House has the sole power of impeachment meaning it can formally accuse federal officials (including the President) of misconduct.</p>
			<p class="wide">The Senate then holds the trial (see Article I, Section 3).</p>
			
			<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
			<p class="wide">To ensure that the people’s chamber holds the power to initiate accountability over federal officials.</p>


	<h3>⚖️ Philosophical Foundation</h3>

	<p class="wide">The framers wanted the House to be:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Closest to the people (direct election, frequent turnover).</li>
		<li>A check on both the Senate (which was originally chosen by state legislatures) and the President.</li>
		<li>Dynamically changes with public opinion in contrast to the Senate’s stability.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="wide">James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 52:</p>
	<p class="wide">
	<em><strong>“The House of Representatives is so constituted as to support in the members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the people.”</strong></em></p>

	<h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>

	<p class="wide">At the time of ratification (1789), the House was the only directly elected federal body.
The Senate and President were indirectly chosen. Representation was initially a major controversy at the Constitutional Convention because small states feared being outvoted by large ones. The Great Compromise created a bicameral legislature balancing population (House) and equal state power (Senate).</p>

	<h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>

<p class="wide">
Article I, Section 2 defines the people’s house as having short terms, direct elections, proportional representation, and the crucial power of impeachment. It anchors the democratic principle that the government must remain accountable to the governed.</p>

	<h2>Section 3: The Senate</h2>
	<p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Original Wording)</p>
	<h3>Clause 1:</h3>
	<p class="wide">The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.</p>

	<h3>Clause 2:</h3>
	<p class="wide">Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.</p>

	<h3>Clause 3:</h3>
	<p class="wide">No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.</p>

	<h3>Clause 4:</h3>
	<p class="wide">The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.</p>

	<h3>Clause 5:</h3>

<section>
	<h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2><br>
	<h3>Clause 1 — Structure of the Senate</h3>

	<p class="wide">Each state has two Senators, regardless of size or population.</p>
	<p class="wide">Senators were originally chosen by state legislatures (changed to direct election by the people through the 17th Amendment, 1913).</p>
	<p class="wide">Each Senator has one vote, ensuring equality among states.</p>

	<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
	<p class="wide">To protect smaller states and preserve their voice in national affairs as a key feature of the Great Compromise between large and small states.</p>

	<h3>Clause 2 — Terms and Continuity</h3>
	<p class="wide">Senators serve six-year terms.</p>
	<p class="wide">The Senate is divided into three classes, so one-third of seats are up for election every two years. This ensures continuity and institutional stability.</p>

<p class="wide">If a seat becomes vacant, the state governor (executive) can make a temporary appointment until the legislature (or voters, after the 17th Amendment) fills the seat.</p>

<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">The Senate was designed to be a “continuing body”. It never dissolves entirely, providing experience and long-term thinking in contrast to the House’s rapid turnover.</p>

<h3>Clause 3 — Qualifications</h3>

<p class="wide">A Senator must:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be at least 30 years old,</li>
<li>Have been a U.S. citizen for 9 years, and</li>
<li>Be an inhabitant of the state they represent.</li>
</ol><br>

	<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
	<p class="wide">Senators were intended to be more seasoned and independent to provide a “cooling influence” on the passions of the House.</p>
	<h3>Clause 4 — The Vice President’s Role</h3>
	<p class="wide">The Vice President serves as President of the Senate, presiding over debates.</p>
	<p class="wide">They do not vote, except to break a tie.</p>

	<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
	<p class="wide">To give the Vice President a formal constitutional duty and to maintain executive-legislative linkage, though limited.</p>

	<h3>Clause 5 — Senate Leadership</h3>
	<p class="wide">The Senate elects its own officers, including a President pro tempore (temporary president) who presides in the Vice President’s absence.</p>

	<h3>📘 Modern Note:</h3>
	<p class="wide">The President pro tempore is often the longest-serving member of the majority party.</p>

	<h3>Clause 6 — Impeachment Trials</h3>
	<p class="wide">The Senate has the sole power to try impeachments (the House only brings charges). Senators must take an oath or affirmation to act impartially. When the President is on trial, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides. Conviction requires a two-thirds vote of Senators present.</p>

	<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
	<p class="wide">To ensure a fair, deliberative body handles impeachment trials, not the more politically volatile House.</p>

	<h3>Clause 7 — Limits on Punishment</h3>
	<p class="wide">
		The Senate’s punishment in impeachment cases is limited to removal from office and disqualification from future office. The convicted individual may still face criminal prosecution in regular courts.</p>

		<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
		<p class="wide">To keep impeachment a constitutional process and not a criminal one. It about public trust, not personal guilt.</p>

			<h3>📘 Purpose of the Senate:</h3>
			<p class="wide">To be a stabilizing, deliberative body that checks both the popular passions of the House and the authority of the Executive. James Madison in Federalist No. 62 called the Senate a “necessary fence” against “sudden impulses” and “fickleness” in legislation.</p>

			<h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>
			<p class="wide">
				Small states demanded equal representation; large states wanted population-based representation.
				The Great Compromise (Connecticut Compromise) of 1787 gave us one of each. State legislative selection of Senators (pre-17th Amendment) was meant to tie the federal government to the states. Direct elections later reflected the growth of democracy and concern over corruption in state legislatures.</p>

				<h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>
				<p class="wide">Article I, Section 3 creates the Senate as a chamber of equality and stability making it a body meant to deliberate, refine, and restrain. Together with the House, it ensures that laws reflect both the will of the people and the sovereignty of the states.</p>

	<h2>Section 4: Elections and Meetings of Congress</h2>
	<p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Original Wording)</p>
	<h3>Clause 1</h3>

	<p class="wide">
	The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.</p>

	<h3>Clause 2</h3>
	<p class="wide">
	The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.</p>
</section>


<section>
	<h2>Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2><br>
	<h3>Clause 1 — State Control of Federal Elections (with Federal Oversight)</h3>
		<p class="wide">Each state legislature decides:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When elections are held</li>
			<li>Where polling places are located</li>
			<li>How elections are conducted (voting systems, procedures, ballots, etc.)</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="wide">However, Congress has the power to change or override those rules (except the physical place where state legislatures originally chose Senators before the 17th Amendment).</p>

<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
		<p class="wide">To balance state sovereignty with national consistency. The framers allowed states to run their own elections but gave Congress final authority to prevent corruption, discrimination, or dysfunction.</p>

	<h3>🏛️ Historical Context</h3>
	<p class="wide">Under the Articles of Confederation, the federal government had no control over elections, leading to inconsistency and chaos. The framers wanted to avoid dependence on state cooperation for national functioning. Congress used this power several times:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>1872: Standardized Election Day (first Tuesday after the first Monday in November).</li>
		<li>1965: Passed the Voting Rights Act, prohibiting racial discrimination in elections.</li>
		<li>1970s–1990s: Enacted campaign finance and registration laws to promote fairness.</li>
	</ol><br>

	<h3>📘 Key Idea:</h3>
	<p class="wide">Elections are local in administration but national in significance. States can set rules but not to the point of undermining democracy.</p>

	<h3>Clause 2 — Congress Must Meet Annually</h3>
		<p class="wide">Congress must assemble at least once every year. Originally set for the first Monday in December, but Congress later changed this date by law to January 3 (20th Amendment, 1933).</p>

	<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
		<p class="wide">
			To ensure the national legislature remains active and accountable there is to be no prolonged recess or neglect.
			This was vital in an age when kings could dismiss parliaments at will.</p>

		<h3>⚖️ Philosophical Foundations</h3>
			<p class="wide">This section embodies a federal balance of power:</p>

		<h3>State Power	Federal Power</h3>
			<p class="wide">
				States manage elections within their borders.	Congress can intervene for uniformity and fairness. 
				States set procedures, times, and qualifications (within constitutional limits).	Congress ensures accessibility, anti-fraud measures, and equal protection. The system promotes both local autonomy and national integrity, preventing either from dominating.</p>

		<h3>🕰️ Modern Implications</h3>
			<p class="wide">This clause underpins many modern election debates:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Federal vs. state control of voting access, mail ballots, and registration.</li>
				<li>Federal oversight of gerrymandering and voter suppression.</li>
				<li>Legislation like the Voting Rights Act, Help America Vote Act, and Electoral Count Act all rely on powers from Article I, Section 4.</li>
			</ul><br>

		<h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>
			<p class="wide">
				Article I, Section 4 ensures the machinery of democracy keeps turning: it guarantees that Congress meets regularly, and it divides control of elections between state initiative and federal oversight, creating a flexible but resilient electoral system.</p>

<h2>Section 5: Rules, Discipline, and Records</h2>
<p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Original Wording)
		<h3>Clause 1</h3>
				<p class="wide">
					Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.</p>

		<h3>Clause 2</h3>

					Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.</p>

			<h3>Clause 3</h3>
					<p class="wide">
 						Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.</p>

			<h3>Clause 4</h3>
			<p class="wide">
				Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</p>
			</section>

<section>
<h2>Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2>
		<h3>Clause 1 — Judging Members and Quorum</h3>
			<p class="wide">
					Each chamber (House and Senate) judges the elections and qualifications of its own members. They decide if someone was properly elected, meets age/citizenship requirements, or was fraudulently seated.</p>
<p class="wide">
A majority of members is needed for a quorum. This is the minimum number to conduct official business.</p>
<p class="wide">
If not enough members are present, a smaller number can compel attendance (e.g., order absent members to appear).</p>
<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">
To protect Congress from outside interference no court or President can dictate who sits in Congress or how many members must be present.</p>

<h3>📖 Example:</h3>
<p class="wide">
In Powell v. McCormack (1969) the Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot exclude a duly elected member who meets constitutional qualifications, though it may expel them after seating.</p>

<h3>Clause 2 — Rules and Discipline</h3>
<p class="wide">Each chamber can:</p>
 <ul>
	<li>Set its own rules of procedure (e.g., filibusters, debates, committees).</li>
	<li>Punish members for disorderly conduct.</li>
	<li>Expel a member with a two-thirds vote.</li>
</ul><br>

<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">
To give Congress autonomy to maintain order and ethics among its members.<br>
Expulsion is rare. It has occurred fewer than 30 times in U.S. history, mostly for treason or corruption.</p>

<h3>Clause 3 — Journals and Transparency</h3>
<p class="wide">Each house must keep a public journal (the modern Congressional Record).</p>
<p class="wide">One-fifth of those present can demand that individual votes (Yeas and Nays) be recorded.</p>
<p class="wide">Some sessions or portions may be kept secret (used rarely, mostly for national security).</p>

<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">
To ensure accountability citizens can see how their representatives vote and what business Congress conducts.
This clause was revolutionary for its time, as most parliaments operated behind closed doors.</p>

<h3>Clause 4 — Adjournment</h3>
<p class="wide">One chamber cannot adjourn for more than three days or move to another location without the consent of the other.</p>

<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">To maintain coordination and prevent one chamber from halting government operations or holding sessions elsewhere for political reasons.</p>

<h3>⚖️ Philosophical Foundations</h3>
<p class="wide">This section enshrines the principle of legislative self-governance:</p>

<h3>Power	Who Holds It	Why It Matters</h3><br>
<ul>
	<li>Judging members	Each chamber	Prevents executive or judicial meddling in elections.</li>
	<li>Setting rules	Each chamber	Allows flexibility and adaptation over time.</li>
	<li>Discipline	Each chamber	Preserves honor and order internally.</li>
	<li>Transparency	Each chamber	Builds public trust through published records.</li>
</ul><br>

<h3>📘 Core Idea:</h3>
<p class="wide">Congress is not merely a lawmaking body; it is a constitutional institution with its own authority, dignity, and independence.</p>

<h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>
<p class="wide">Early Congresses kept handwritten journals; the first official Congressional Record was established in 1873.</p>
<p class="wide">Internal rules like the Senate filibuster, House committee system, and ethics codes all arise from this constitutional authority.</p>
<p class="wide">During the Civil War and Reconstruction, this power allowed Congress to exclude or expel members who joined the Confederacy.</p>

<h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>
<p class="wide">
Article I, Section 5 ensures that Congress governs itself setting its own rules, judging its members, maintaining order, and keeping the people informed. It embodies the Founders’ belief that the legislative branch must be independent, transparent, and self-regulating.</p>

They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.</p>

<h3>Clause 2 — Restrictions on Holding Other Offices</h3>
<p class="wide">
No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time;and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.</p>

<h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2>
<h3>Clause 1 — Compensation and Privileges</h3>
<p class="wide">💰 Compensation</p>
<p class="wide">
Congress members are paid by the federal government, not by their states. This ensures independence from state pressure and guarantees that service is accessible to ordinary citizens, not just the wealthy. Their pay is set by law, meaning both chambers must approve and the President must sign it.</p>

<h3>📘 Modern Note:</h3>
<p class="wide">
Congress currently sets its pay through legislation, but the 27th Amendment (1992) now prevents pay changes from taking effect until after the next election, ensuring accountability.</p>

<h3>🛡️ Privilege from Arrest</h3>
<p class="wide">Members cannot be arrested (except for treason, felony, or breach of the peace) while:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Attending sessions</li>
	<li>Traveling to or from Congress</li>
</ol><br>

<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">To prevent harassment or politically motivated arrests by opponents or the executive branch.</p>
<p class="wide">This privilege:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Applies only to civil arrests (like lawsuits or debts)</li>
	<li>Does not shield members from criminal prosecution</li>
</ol><br>

<h3>🗣️ Speech or Debate Clause</h3>
<p class="wide"><em>
“...for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.”</em></p>
<p class="wide">
This grants members absolute immunity for anything said or done as part of legislative activity.<br>
It protects freedom of debate and the integrity of the lawmaking process.</p>

<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">To allow open discussion, dissent, and criticism of the executive without fear of lawsuit or prosecution.</p>

<h3>📖 Case Example:</h3>
<p class="wide">
In Gravel v. United States (1972), the Supreme Court held that a Senator introducing the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record was immune from prosecution, as it was a legislative act.</p>

<h3>Clause 2 — Restrictions on Holding Other Offices</h3>

<p class="wide">🚫 No Double-Dipping</p>
<p class="wide">
A sitting Senator or Representative cannot be appointed to a new or improved federal office during their term. (Example: if Congress raises the salary of the Secretary of State, no current member can take that job during their term.)
</p>

<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">To prevent corruption and self-dealing members can’t create high-paying jobs for themselves.</p>

<h3>⚖️ Separation of Powers</h3>
<p class="wide">
No person can serve simultaneously in Congress and in another federal office (executive or judicial). This enforces the separation of powers and prevents the blending of legislative and executive authority.</p>

<h3>📖 Historical Note:</h3>

<p class="wide">
This reflects fear of British corruption, where members of Parliament could hold royal appointments, effectively turning legislators into agents of the crown.</p>

<h3>📘 Core Idea:</h3>
<p class="wide">
Congress must be free to speak, act, and deliberate without fear of arrest, retaliation, or bribery from the other branches.</p>

<h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>
<p class="wide">During the founding era, British monarchs often used money and appointments to buy parliamentary loyalty.</p>
<p class="wide">The framers wanted a legislature that was:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Independent of the Executive</li>
	<li>Accountable to the people</li>
	<li>And shielded from coercion or corruption</li>
</ol><br>

<h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>

Article I, Section 6 protects the dignity, independence, and freedom of Congress.<br>
It ensures lawmakers are paid fairly, speak freely, and serve only one master, "the people".</p>

	<h2>Section 7: How a Bill Becomes Law</h2>
	<p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Original Wording)</p>
	<p class="wide">This section explains how Congress creates laws, introduces the Presidential veto, and establishes a clear system of checks and balances between the legislative and executive branches.</p>

	<h3>Clause 1 — Revenue Bills</h3>
	<p class="wide">
		All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.</p>

		<h3>Clause 2 — How a Bill Becomes Law</h3>
		<p class="wide">Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections, to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law.</p>

		<p class="wide">In all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.</p>

		<h3>Clause 3 — Resolutions</h3>
		<p class="wide">Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States;
		and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>🧩 Plain Explanation</h2>
		<h3>Clause 1 — Revenue Bills Must Start in the House</h3>
		<p class="wide">Any bill that raises money (taxes, tariffs, etc.) must start in the House of Representatives. The Senate, however, can amend those bills just as it can with any other bill.</p>

		<h3>📘 Reasoning:</h3>
		<p class="wide">The framers wanted taxation to begin with the people’s representatives, who are directly elected and serve short two-year terms. This echoes the colonial slogan: “No taxation without representation.”</p>

		<h3>Clause 2 — The Legislative Process</h3>
		<p class="wide">This clause lays out the step-by-step process for how a bill becomes law.</p>

		<h3>🏛️ 1. Passage in Both Houses</h3>
		<p class="wide">A bill must first pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate by majority vote.</p>

		<h3>✍️ 2. Presentation to the President</h3>
		<p class="wide">Once passed by Congress, the bill is sent to the President.</p>

		<h3>✅ 3. Presidential Approval</h3>
		<p class="wide">If the President approves, he signs it into law.</p>

		<h3>❌ 4. Presidential Veto</h3>
		<p class="wide">If the President disapproves, he returns the bill to the house it came from, with written objections (a veto message).</p>

		<h3>🗳️ 5. Congressional Override</h3>
		<p class="wide">Congress can still pass the bill over the veto if:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Two-thirds of both the House and the Senate vote to approve it again.</li>
			<li>This is called a veto override.</li>
		</ul><br>

		<h3>⏰ 6. The 10-Day Rule</h3>
		<p class="wide">If the President does nothing for 10 days (excluding Sundays):</p>
		<p class="wide">The bill automatically becomes law, unless Congress has adjourned. If Congress has adjourned, preventing the bill’s return, the bill dies automatically. This is called a “pocket veto.”</p>

		<h3>Clause 3 — Presidential Role in Resolutions</h3>
		<p class="wide">Not just bills, but any major resolution or order requiring approval from both houses must also go to the President. This ensures Congress can’t bypass the President by calling something a “resolution” instead of a “bill.”</p>

		<h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
		<p class="wide">To prevent Congress from evading the veto power by using other legislative tools.</p>

		<h3>⚖️ Checks and Balances in Action</h3><br>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Branch</th>
				<th>Power</th>
				<th>Check Against</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Congress</td>
				<td>Makes laws</td>
				<td>The President can veto</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>President</td>
				<td>Vetoes laws</td>
				<td>Congress can override with 2/3 vote</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Courts</td>
				<td>Review laws</td>
				<td>Can declare unconstitutional</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p class="wide">This system ensures no single branch dominates the lawmaking process.</p>

		<h3>🧠 Key Concepts</h3><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Bicameral approval: Both chambers must agree before any law passes.</li>
			<li>Presentment Clause: Every bill must be presented to the President.</li>
			<li>Veto power: The President can block legislation but not permanently.</li>
			<li>Override: Congress can assert its authority with supermajority support.</li>
			<li>Transparency: Votes on veto overrides must be recorded by name.</li>
		</ul><br>

		<h3>🕰️ Historical and Philosophical Context</h3>
		<p class="wide">The framers designed this process to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Prevent hasty or emotional legislation</li>
			<li>Encourage deliberation and compromise</li>
			<li>And protect against executive tyranny by allowing an override</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="wide">James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 51:</p>
		<p class="wide"><em>“Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”</em></p>
			<p class="wide">The veto power and override process reflect that exact principle.</p>

			<h3>🧾 Modern Relevance</h3>

			<p class="wide">Pocket Vetoes remain controversial. Presidents have used them during congressional adjournments to block bills quietly. Veto Overrides are rare, showing how difficult it is to get two-thirds support. Line-item veto (the power to veto parts of a bill) was briefly allowed in the 1990s but declared unconstitutional in Clinton v. City of New York (1998).</p>


			<h3>🧩 In Summary</h3>

			<p class="wide">
			Article I, Section 7 establishes a deliberate, multi-step process for making laws. It guarantees that no law passes without the consent of both houses and the President, ensuring that power is shared, checked, and balanced.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2>

		<p class="wide">Article I, Section 8 enumerates the powers of Congress. These powers are limited, not unlimited. Congress may only act in ways authorized by the Constitution or necessary to implement its powers.</p>

		<h3>⚖️ Key Principles</h3>

		<p class="wide"> Enumerated Powers:</p>
		<p class="wide">Powers explicitly granted to Congress, e.g., taxing, declaring war, regulating commerce.</p>
		<p class="wide">Implied Powers:</p>
		<p class="wide">Arise from the Necessary and Proper Clause. Allows Congress to do things not explicitly listed if they are reasonably related to enumerated powers. Example: creating the IRS (to collect taxes), regulating air travel (under commerce power).</p>

		<p class="wide">Federalism Balance: Congress’s powers enumerated here contrast with powers reserved to the states (10th Amendment).</p>

		<h3>📖 Historical Context</h3>

		<p class="wide">Framers debated broad versus narrow powers. Anti-Federalists feared that broad powers (like commerce and necessary/proper) could lead to federal tyranny. Federalists argued that limited powers must be flexible enough to meet future needs. The Necessary and Proper Clause (often called the “Elastic Clause”) has been used to justify expansive federal action:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) — upheld the creation of a national bank.</li>
			<li>Wickard v. Filburn (1942) — federal regulation of wheat production under commerce power.</li>
		</ul><br>

		<h3>🧠 Modern Relevance</h3>
		<p class="wide">Congress uses these powers to:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Tax and spend for programs like Social Security, Medicare, and defense.</li>
			<li>Regulate interstate commerce, including transportation, banking, and environmental laws.</li>
			<li>Declare war and maintain the military, though in modern times, presidents also exercise military power.</li>
			<li>Legislate broadly under the Necessary and Proper Clause, allowing flexibility for unforeseen issues.</li>
		</ol><br>

		<h3>🧩 In Summary</h3>

		<p class="wide">
Article I, Section 8 defines the core powers of the federal government and ensures Congress can legislate effectively while remaining constitutionally limited. It balances enumerated powers with implied powers, giving the legislature the tools to govern in a dynamic nation.</p>

</ol><br>

<h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2>
<h3>1. Treaties, Coinage, and Nobility</h3>
<p class="wide">States cannot:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make foreign treaties or alliances means only the federal government may do this.</li>
	<li>Coin money or issue paper currency means only Congress controls money.</li>

<p class="wide">The framers sought to balance state sovereignty with national cohesion.</p>

<h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>
<p class="wide">
Article I, Section 10 ensures that states cannot undermine federal power, interfere with contracts, or act independently in war or foreign affairs. Together with Section 9, these clauses define the limits of all government power, creating a balance between federal authority and individual and state rights.</p>
