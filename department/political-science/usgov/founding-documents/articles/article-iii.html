🇺🇸 Article III, Section 1 — Judicial Power and Courts
📜 Full Text

Clause 1 — Judicial Power
The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.
The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.

🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown
1. Establishment of the Courts

Supreme Court: The Constitution creates one Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the U.S.

Inferior Courts: Congress has the power to create lower federal courts as needed.
📘 Purpose:
Provides flexibility while ensuring a national judiciary to interpret laws uniformly.

2. Tenure of Judges

Judges serve “during good Behaviour”, which typically means life tenure unless removed via impeachment.
📘 Purpose:
Ensures judicial independence from political pressures.

3. Compensation

Judges’ salaries cannot be reduced while in office.
📘 Purpose:
Protects judges from retaliation by Congress or the President, maintaining impartiality.

⚖️ Philosophical and Constitutional Significance
Feature	Purpose
Supreme Court	Provides final authority on federal law and Constitution
Inferior courts	Flexibility to handle cases nationwide
Life tenure	Ensures judicial independence

📘 Core Idea:

Article III, Section 1 establishes a strong, independent judiciary capable of interpreting laws and protecting the Constitution without undue influence from the legislative or executive branches.

🕰️ Historical Context

Under the Articles of Confederation, there was no national judiciary, leading to inconsistent interpretations of law.

Framers wanted life tenure to prevent judges from being swayed by political pressures or popularity.

Judicial independence was seen as essential to balance legislative and executive power.

🧠 In Summary

Article III, Section 1 creates the Supreme Court and federal judiciary, ensures judicial independence through life tenure and protected salaries, and allows Congress to establish lower courts as needed.
It safeguards the rule of law and ensures fair, consistent interpretation of the Constitution.

🇺🇸 Article III, Section 3 — Treason
📜 Full Text

Clause 1 — Definition of Treason
Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.

Clause 2 — Conviction
No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.

Clause 3 — Punishment
Congress has the power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.

🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown
1. Definition of Treason

Treason is limited to:

Levying war against the United States (armed rebellion).

Adhering to enemies, giving them aid or comfort.

📘 Purpose:
Prevents misuse of treason charges for political purposes—treason cannot be loosely applied.

2. Conviction Rules

To convict someone:

Must have two witnesses to the same overt act, or

Must be confessed in open court.

📘 Purpose:
Ensures high evidentiary standards to protect individual rights.

Prevents false accusations and political abuse (a problem under English rule).

3. Punishment and Limitations

Congress decides the punishment for treason.

Corruption of blood is prohibited:

Family members cannot be punished or inherit guilt.

Forfeiture of property lasts only for the life of the convicted person.

📘 Purpose:
Ensures punishment is limited, just, and individual, not hereditary.

⚖️ Philosophical and Constitutional Significance
Feature	Purpose / Reasoning
Narrow definition	Prevents abuse of treason charges
Two-witness rule	Protects due process and prevents false accusations
Limitation on punishment	Avoids punishing families or future generations
Congressional power	Balances legislative discretion with safeguards

📘 Core Idea:

Section 3 strictly limits the federal government’s power to define, prosecute, and punish treason, ensuring fairness, evidence, and individual rights.

🕰️ Historical Context

Treason under English law was broad and often politically abused.

Framers wanted a precise, narrow definition to protect political opponents and ordinary citizens.

The high evidentiary standard (two witnesses) reflects the framers’ concern about wrongful conviction.

🧠 In Summary

Article III, Section 3 defines treason narrowly, establishes strict rules of evidence, and limits punishment to the individual convicted.
It protects both national security and individual liberties, balancing government power and citizen rights.
