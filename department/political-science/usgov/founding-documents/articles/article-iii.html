      <h3>Clause 1 — Judicial Power</h3>
      <p class="wide">
      The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.

      <h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2><br>
      <h3>1. Establishment of the Courts</h3><br>
      

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supreme Court:</strong> The Constitution creates one Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the U.S.</li>
        <li><strong>Inferior Courts:</strong> Congress has the power to create lower federal courts as needed.</li>
      </ul><br>


        <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
        <p class="wide">Provides flexibility while ensuring a national judiciary to interpret laws uniformly.</p>

        <h3>2. Tenure of Judges</h3>
        <p class="wide">Judges serve “during good Behaviour”, which typically means life tenure unless removed via impeachment.</p>

        <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
        <p class="wide">Ensures judicial independence from political pressures.</p>

        <h3>3. Compensation</h3>
        <p class="wide">Judges’ salaries cannot be reduced while in office.</p>

        <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
        <p class="wide">Protects judges from retaliation by Congress or the President, maintaining impartiality.</p>

        <h3>⚖️ Philosophical and Constitutional Significance</h3><br>

        <h3>📘 Core Idea:</h3>

        <p class="wide">
        Article III, Section 1 establishes a strong, independent judiciary capable of interpreting laws and protecting the Constitution without undue influence from the legislative or executive branches.</p>

        <h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>

        <p class="wide">
        Under the Articles of Confederation, there was no national judiciary, leading to inconsistent interpretations of law. Framers wanted life tenure to prevent judges from being swayed by political pressures or popularity. Judicial independence was seen as essential to balance legislative and executive power.</p>

        <h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>

        <p class="wide">Article III, Section 1 creates the Supreme Court and federal judiciary, ensures judicial independence through life tenure and protected salaries, and allows Congress to establish lower courts as needed.

          <h2>Section 2: Judicial Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p class="wide">📜 Full Text (Summarized)</p>

            <h3>Scope of Judicial Power</h3>
            <p class="wide">Federal courts have jurisdiction over cases arising from:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The Constitution</li>
              <li>Federal laws</li>
              <li>Treaties</li>
              <li>Ambassadors and public ministers</li>
              <li>Admiralty and maritime cases</li>
              <li>Controversies involving the United States</li>

              <li>Original and Appellate Jurisdiction</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="wide">Supreme Court has:</p>
        <p class="wide">
        Original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, public ministers, consuls, and when a state is a party.
        Appellate jurisdiction in all other federal cases, with exceptions and regulations set by Congress.
        </p>

        <h3>Trial by Jury</h3>
        <p class="wide">
        All crimes, except impeachment cases, shall be tried by jury. Trials are held in the state where the crime occurred.
        </p>
        </section>


        <section>
          <h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2><br>
            <h3>1. Scope of Judicial Power</h3>
            <p class="wide">Federal courts can hear cases involving:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><strong>The Constitution and federal law</strong> — ensures uniform interpretation.</li>
             <li><strong>Treaties</strong> — maintains U.S. credibility in international law.</li>
             <li><strong>Disputes between states or citizens of different states</strong> — prevents state bias.</li>
             <li><strong>Admiralty/maritime law</strong> — federal oversight of international and interstate waters.</li>
            </ul><br>

          <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
          <p class="wide">Ensures federal issues are resolved at the national level, while leaving local matters to state courts.</p>

          <h3>2. Original vs. Appellate Jurisdiction</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Original jurisdiction: Cases that go directly to the Supreme Court.</li>
            <li>Mainly involves ambassadors, consuls, public ministers, or a state as a party.</li>
            <li>Appellate jurisdiction: Cases reviewed by the Supreme Court after being decided in lower courts.</li>
            <li>Congress can regulate appellate jurisdiction — gives flexibility while respecting separation of powers.</li>
          </ul><br>

          <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
          <p class="wide">Prevents the Supreme Court from being overloaded and allows Congress to manage federal court structure.</p>

          <h3>3. Trial by Jury</h3>

          <p class="wide">Guarantees that criminal cases, except impeachment, are decided by a jury of peers. This ensures trials are held locally, close to where the alleged crime occurred.</p>

          <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
          <p class="wide">Protects citizens’ rights, prevents unfair trials, and limits federal overreach.</p>

          <h3>📘 Core Idea:</h3>

          <p class="wide">Section 2 defines what federal courts can hear, ensures fair trials, and balances federal and state authority.</p>

          <h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>

          <p class="wide">
            Framers wanted federal courts to resolve disputes between states and enforce uniform federal law. Jury trials and local trials reflect English common law protections and the colonial experience with fair trials. Admiralty jurisdiction reflects the need to regulate trade and maritime disputes in the growing nation.
          </p>

          <h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>

          <p class="wide">
            Article III, Section 2 gives federal courts clear authority to hear specific types of cases, distinguishes original and appellate jurisdiction, and guarantees jury trials for crimes. It balances federal judicial power with citizens’ rights and state sovereignty.

          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>🧩 Plain Meaning and Breakdown</h2><br>

          <h3>1. Definition of Treason</h3>

          <ul>

            <li>Must be confessed in open court.</li>
          </ul><br>

          <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>

          <ul>

          </ul><br>

          <h3>3. Punishment and Limitations</h3>

          <p class="wide">Congress decides the punishment for treason. Corruption of blood is prohibited:</p>

          <ul>

            <li>Forfeiture of property lasts only for the life of the convicted person.</li>
          </ul><br>

          <h3>📘 Purpose:</h3>
          <p class="wide">Ensures punishment is limited, just, and individual, not hereditary.</p>

          <h3>📘 Core Idea:</h3>

          <p class="wide">
            Section 3 strictly limits the federal government’s power to define, prosecute, and punish treason, ensuring fairness, evidence, and individual rights.
          </p>

          <h3>🕰️ Historical Context</h3>

          <p class="wide">
            Treason under English law was broad and often politically abused. Framers wanted a precise, narrow definition to protect political opponents and ordinary citizens. The high evidentiary standard (two witnesses) reflects the framers’ concern about wrongful conviction.
          </p>

          <h3>🧠 In Summary</h3>

          <p class="wide">
            Article III, Section 3 defines treason narrowly, establishes strict rules of evidence, and limits punishment to the individual convicted. It protects both national security and individual liberties, balancing government power and citizen rights.
