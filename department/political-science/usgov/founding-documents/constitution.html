  <h2 id="overview">Overview of the U.S. Constitution</h2>
  <p class="wide">
The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land and the outlining the fundamental framework and principles of the federal government. Drafted in 1787 and ratified in 1788, it is the world's longest-surviving written charter of government. It establishes three branches of government as legislative, executive, and judicial. A system of checks and balances is used to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. Composed of a Preamble, seven Articles, and 27 Amendments, the Constitution also defines the rights of citizens, with the first ten amendments known as the Bill of Rights.</p>
</section>

<section id="structure">

<p class="wide">Seven Articles: Sections of text that establish how the government is structured and operates.</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Article I: Defines the legislative branch (Congress).</li>
<li>Article II: Establishes the executive branch (the presidency).</li>
<li>Article III: Outlines the judicial branch (the federal court system).</li>
<li>Article IV: Addresses the relationship between states and the federal government.</li>
<li>Article V: Defines the process for amending the Constitution.</li>
<li>Article VI: Establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land.</li>
<li>Article VII: Describes the process for ratification.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="wide"> Twenty-seven Amendments: These are official changes or additions made since the Constitution was ratified. The first ten are known as the Bill of Rights and protect specific individual liberties guaranteeing fundamental rights like freedom of speech and religion. 27 changes have been made to the Constitution over time.</p>
</section>

<section id="key">
<h2>Key principles</h2>
<ol>
<li>Separation of Powers: The government's powers are divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.</li>
<li>Checks and Balances: Each branch has the ability to limit the powers of the other two to maintain a balance.</li>
<li>Supreme Law: The Constitution is the highest law in the land, and no other law can contradict it.</li>
<li>"Living Document": The Constitution can be amended to adapt to changing needs, though it has only been amended 27 times in over 200 years.</li>
</ol> 

<p class="wide">Key features of the Constitution include "We the People" as its first three words declaring that the government's power originates from and serves its citizens. Separation of powers The government is divided into three distinct branches to prevent any single one from becoming too powerful.
Congress forms the Legislative Branch which is in charge of creating new laws. The President is in charge of the Executive Branch which executes and enforces laws. The Judicial Branch is led by the Supreme Court who interprets and applies laws. Checks and balances, as a system, allows each branch of government to limit the powers of the other branches. Federalism is the name given to the method in which federal and state governments share power. </p>
