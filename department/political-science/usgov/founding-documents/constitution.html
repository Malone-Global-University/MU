Drafted in 1787 and ratified in 1788, it is the world's longest-surviving written charter of government. It establishes three branches of government as legislative, executive, and judicial. A system of checks and balances is used to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. Composed of a Preamble, seven Articles, and 27 Amendments, the Constitution also defines the rights of citizens, with the first ten amendments known as the Bill of Rights.</p>

</ol> 

<p class="wide">Key features of the Constitution include "We the People" as its first three words declaring that the government's power originates from and serves its citizens. Separation of powers The government is divided into three distinct branches to prevent any single one from becoming too powerful.
Congress forms the Legislative Branch which is in charge of creating new laws. The President is in charge of the Executive Branch which executes and enforces laws. The Judicial Branch is led by the Supreme Court who interprets and applies laws. Checks and balances, as a system, allows each branch of government to limit the powers of the other branches.
