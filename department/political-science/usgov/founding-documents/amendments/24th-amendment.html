      <h2>24th Amendment (1964)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified January 23, 1964 — Prohibits poll taxes in federal elections.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Twenty-fourth Amendment prohibits the use of poll taxes in federal elections. Poll taxes had been used in several states to restrict voting access, particularly targeting African Americans and low-income citizens. This amendment ensures that financial status cannot block a citizen’s right to vote.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.”
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Poll taxes were historically used to disenfranchise minority voters and economically disadvantaged citizens, especially in the Southern United States. The 24th Amendment was a key step in the civil rights movement, guaranteeing that federal voting rights were protected from economic barriers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        By eliminating poll taxes, the 24th Amendment expanded the electorate and strengthened democratic participation. It set a precedent for other civil rights protections and contributed to later legislation, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should explore the history of poll taxes, their impact on voting rights, and the broader civil rights movement. Case studies of southern states before and after ratification highlight the amendment’s practical effects.
