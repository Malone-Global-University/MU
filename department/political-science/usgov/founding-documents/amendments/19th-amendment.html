      <h2>19th Amendment (1920)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified August 18, 1920 — Granted women the right to vote in federal and state elections.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Nineteenth Amendment represents the culmination of the women’s suffrage movement in the United States. It prohibits denying the right to vote on the basis of sex, empowering women to participate fully in the democratic process and shaping the nation’s political landscape.
      </p>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        For decades, activists such as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Alice Paul campaigned tirelessly for women’s political rights. Despite opposition and societal resistance, the movement gained momentum through state-level victories, activism, and national advocacy, culminating in the ratification of the 19th Amendment.
      </p>

      <p class="wide">
        The amendment is a landmark achievement in civil rights, reflecting Progressive Era reforms and the expansion of democratic participation in the United States.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The 19th Amendment significantly reshaped American politics by enfranchising millions of women. It influenced electoral outcomes, party strategies, and public policy, and serves as a foundation for ongoing struggles for voting rights and equality.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should examine the broader social and legal context of the amendment, including the suffrage movement, state ratification debates, and subsequent legislation such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Key primary sources include suffragist writings, Congressional records, and state referendum documents.
