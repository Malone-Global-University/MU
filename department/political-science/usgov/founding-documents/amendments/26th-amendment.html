      <h2>26th Amendment (1971)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified July 1, 1971 — Lowers voting age to 18 years.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Twenty-sixth Amendment guarantees that citizens of the United States who are 18 years or older cannot be denied the right to vote based on age. This amendment was largely motivated by the Vietnam War, as young citizens who were eligible for military service sought representation in elections.
      </p>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.”
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Before the 26th Amendment, states could set their own voting age, with many requiring voters to be 21. The amendment ensured that younger citizens, especially those eligible for military service, were also granted full democratic participation in elections.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The amendment expanded the electorate by millions of young voters and remains a cornerstone of youth engagement in politics. It illustrates the principle that those subject to the laws and responsibilities of citizenship should have a voice in democratic governance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should study the connection between the Vietnam War, youth activism, and the push for voting rights. Examining voter turnout and political participation trends among 18- to 21-year-olds highlights the amendment’s significance.
