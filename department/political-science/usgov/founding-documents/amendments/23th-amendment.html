      <h2>23rd Amendment (1961)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified March 29, 1961 — Grants Washington D.C. residents electoral votes in presidential elections.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Twenty-third Amendment allows residents of the District of Columbia to participate in presidential elections. It grants D.C. a number of electors equal to the least populous state, currently three, giving residents a voice in choosing the President and Vice President.
      </p>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “The District constituting the seat of Government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as Congress may direct: A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States, and shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State.”
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Prior to the 23rd Amendment, residents of Washington D.C. could not vote for President or Vice President, despite being U.S. citizens. The amendment was part of the broader civil rights and democratic expansion movement, ensuring all citizens in the capital had a voice in national elections.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The 23rd Amendment gave D.C. residents participation in the Electoral College, although it does not grant full congressional representation. It highlighted the importance of including all citizens in the democratic process, and remains a key part of debates about D.C. statehood and representation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should explore the history of Washington D.C.’s lack of voting rights, examine debates leading to the amendment, and study its effect on presidential elections and ongoing discussions about voting rights and statehood.
