    <h2>Twelfth Amendment (1804)</h2>
    <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified 1804 — Reform of presidential and vice-presidential election procedures</p>

    <p class="wide">
      The Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted to fix critical flaws in the presidential election system exposed by the elections of 1796 and 1800. Under the original procedure in Article II, each elector cast two votes for President; the person with the most votes became President, and the runner-up became Vice President. This system failed once political parties emerged, leading to confusion, rivalry, and near-constitutional crisis.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      The election of 1800, which resulted in a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, highlighted the urgent need for reform. The Twelfth Amendment created a new process: electors would now cast separate ballots for President and Vice President. This ensured that running mates would not tie or oppose each other, and that political alliances could function more smoothly within the Electoral College.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="amendment-text">
    <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
    <p class="wide"><em><b>
      “The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President...”
    </b></em></p>

    <p class="wide">
      In summary, the 12th Amendment restructured the Electoral College to prevent future ties and conflicts. It also defined what happens if no candidate receives a majority: the House of Representatives chooses the President from the top three candidates, with each state delegation casting one vote. The Senate chooses the Vice President if necessary.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
    <p class="wide">
      The original constitutional system was designed before political parties existed. Once parties emerged, the idea of having the “runner-up” as Vice President became unworkable. The 1796 election produced a divided administration: Federalist John Adams as President and Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson as Vice President. The 1800 election tie pushed the system to the brink, taking 36 ballots in the House of Representatives to resolve.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      The Twelfth Amendment solved these problems by modernizing the process. It recognized that political parties were now a permanent feature of American politics. The result was a clearer, more stable, and more democratic method of selecting both President and Vice President.
    </p>

    <h2>Further Study</h2>
    <p class="wide">
      To understand the origins of the 12th Amendment, students should study the contested election of 1800 and read early documents on the Electoral College system. Additional resources can be found in the <a href="../../../law/constitutional/home">Constitutional Law</a> section of the Malone Global University Law Department.
