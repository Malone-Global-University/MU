      <h2>18th Amendment (1919)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified January 16, 1919 — Prohibited the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Eighteenth Amendment marked the beginning of <strong>Prohibition</strong> in the United States, a nationwide ban on the production, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages. It was driven by the temperance movement, social reformers, and Progressive Era activists who sought to reduce crime, poverty, and moral corruption associated with alcohol consumption.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.<br><br>
        Section 2. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<br><br>
        Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.”
      </b></em></p>

      <p class="wide">
        The amendment legally prohibited alcohol but relied on federal and state enforcement, leading to widespread illegal production and distribution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The Eighteenth Amendment was the culmination of decades of activism by temperance organizations and moral reformers. Alcohol was seen as a source of social ills, including domestic violence, poverty, and crime. World War I also fueled support by emphasizing grain conservation and patriotism.
      </p>

      <p class="wide">
        Enforcement proved extremely difficult. Speakeasies, bootlegging, and organized crime flourished, making Prohibition one of the most controversial periods in American history. The amendment’s failure eventually led to its repeal by the <strong>21st Amendment in 1933</strong>, the only instance of a constitutional amendment being fully repealed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Despite its failure, the 18th Amendment had lasting effects on U.S. law, governance, and society. It demonstrated the limits of moral legislation, reshaped federal and state enforcement powers, and influenced subsequent debates on regulation, personal freedom, and government intervention.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should study the social, economic, and legal impacts of Prohibition, including cases such as <a href="../../law/constitutional/cases/ozawa-v-us">Ozawa v. United States</a> and the rise of organized crime. Contextualizing the amendment within the Progressive Era provides deeper understanding of U.S. policy-making and constitutional reform.
