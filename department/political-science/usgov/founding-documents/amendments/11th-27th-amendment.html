  <h2>11th Amendment (1795)</h2>

<h3>Text:</h3>
<p class="wide">‚ÄúThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.‚Äù</p>

<h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>

<p class="wide">Before the 11th Amendment, the Supreme Court case Chisholm v. Georgia (1793) ruled that a citizen of one state could sue another state in federal court. This caused a huge backlash: many states did not want to be forced into court by citizens of other states.</p>

<h3>Solution:</h3>
<p class="wide">The 11th Amendment limits federal court jurisdiction over cases where a state is sued by individuals from another state or country. Essentially, it gives states sovereign immunity from certain lawsuits.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<h3>Sovereign Immunity:</h3>

<p class="wide">
 States cannot be sued in federal court by citizens of another state or foreign citizens without their consent.</p>

<h3>Not Absolute:</h3>

<p class="wide">
 States can still be sued by their own citizens under some circumstances or in state courts. Congress can sometimes authorize certain suits under its constitutional powers.</p>

<h3>Impact:</h3>

<p class="wide">
 Strengthened state sovereignty and reduced federal court interference in state matters.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<h3>Before 11th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide"> A New York citizen could sue Georgia in federal court over a debt.</p>

<h3>After 11th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">That same suit cannot proceed unless Georgia consents.</p>


<h2>12th Amendment (1804):</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 12th Amendment revised the process for electing the President and Vice President. Instead of the original procedure in Article II, Section 1 (which caused problems in early elections) it separates the votes for President and Vice President in the Electoral College.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>
<p class="wide">Under the original system, each elector cast two votes for President, and the runner-up became Vice President. This led to confusion and political conflict in the election of 1800 between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, where they tied in electoral votes, requiring a vote in the House of Representatives to decide the winner. The 12th Amendment fixed this by creating separate ballots for President and Vice President in the Electoral College.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<h3>Separate Electoral Votes:</h3>
<p class="wide">Electors cast one vote for President and one vote for Vice President.</p>

<h3>House of Representatives Role:</h3>
<p class="wide">If no candidate gets a majority of electoral votes, the House chooses the President from the top three candidates.</p>

<h3>Senate Role:</h3>
<p class="wide">If no Vice Presidential candidate gets a majority, the Senate chooses the Vice President.</p>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">Prevents ties and ensures that President and Vice President are elected as a team rather than rivals.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Election of 1800:</h3>
<p class="wide">Jefferson and Burr tied in electoral votes. The House had to decide the President after 36 ballots.</p>

<h3>After 12th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Electors now vote separately for President and Vice President, preventing the same problem.</p>



<h2>13th Amendment (1865)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 13th Amendment abolishes slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States, except as punishment for a crime.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>

<ul>	
<li>Slavery was legal in many states and was a central issue of the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865).</li>
<li>President Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Emancipation Proclamation (1863) freed enslaved people in Confederate states but did not abolish slavery nationwide.</li>
<li>The 13th Amendment permanently outlawed slavery throughout the United States.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide"> Ratified on December 6, 1865, after the Civil War ended.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<p class="wide">Abolition of Slavery: Slavery is illegal in all forms in the U.S.</p>

<p class="wide">Exception For Criminal Punishment: Forced labor is still allowed as punishment for someone convicted of a crime.</p>

<p class="wide">Federal Enforcement: Congress has the power to pass laws to enforce the amendment.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Legally freed millions of enslaved African Americans.</p>

<p class="wide">Set the stage for the 14th Amendment (citizenship and equal protection) and 15th Amendment (voting rights).</p>

<p class="wide">This changed the legal and social structure of the United States, especially in the South. For example enslaved individuals in Southern states were considered property, after slavery was unconstitutional formerly enslaved people were legally free.</p>


<h2>14th Amendment (1868)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>
<p class="wide">The 14th Amendment grants citizenship and equal protection under the law to all persons born or naturalized in the United States. It also limits the powers of states in infringing on individual rights.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>
<p class="wide">After the Civil War, the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, but freed African Americans still faced discrimination and unequal treatment, especially in Southern states. The 14th Amendment was designed to protect civil rights at the federal level and ensure states could not deny basic rights.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on July 9, 1868.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>

<p class="wide">Citizenship Clause: Anyone born or naturalized in the U.S. is a U.S. citizen. This overturned the Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) decision, which denied citizenship to African Americans.
</p>

<p class="wide">Due Process Clause: States cannot deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This extends legal protections to individuals against state actions.</p>

<p class="wide">Equal Protection Clause: States must provide equal protection under the law to all people within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="wide">Basis for landmark civil rights cases (e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 1954).</p>
<p class="wide">Incorporation Doctrine: Through later court rulings, many protections in the Bill of Rights were applied to the states via the 14th Amendment.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Civil Rights: Provided constitutional basis for ending racial segregation and discrimination.</p>

<p class="wide">Legal Protections: Ensures states cannot pass laws that violate individual rights.</p>

<p class="wide">Modern Influence: Used in court cases involving voting rights, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and more.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before:</h3>
<p class="wide">States could deny African Americans the right to vote or equal education.</p>

<h3>After:</h3>
<p class="wide">States are constitutionally prohibited from denying equal rights, though enforcement required decades of civil rights activism.</p>

<p class="wide">Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:</p>

<h2>15th Amendment (1870)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 15th Amendment prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on ‚Äúrace, color, or previous condition of servitude.‚Äù</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>
<p class="wide">After the Civil War, the 13th Amendment abolished slavery and the 14th Amendment guaranteed citizenship and equal protection. However, African American men still faced widespread voter suppression, especially in Southern states. The 15th Amendment was ratified to secure voting rights for Black men.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on February 3, 1870.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>

<p class="wide">Voting Rights Protection: Citizens cannot be denied the right to vote based on race, color, or prior slavery.</p>

<p class="wide">Congressional Enforcement: Congress has the power to pass laws to enforce the amendment and protect voting rights.</p>

<p class="wide">Limitations in Practice: Despite the amendment, literacy tests, poll taxes, and intimidation were used to suppress Black voters, especially during the Jim Crow era.</p>

<p class="wide">Full protection wasn‚Äôt effectively enforced until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Legal Basis for Voting Rights: Laid the foundation for federal efforts to prevent racial discrimination in voting.</p>

<p class="wide">Civil Rights Movement: Provided a constitutional tool for activists to challenge disenfranchisement.</p>

<p class="wide">Modern Influence: Protects voting rights regardless of race and informs current debates on voting access.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before:</h3>
<p class="wide">Formerly enslaved Black men were largely barred from voting in Southern states.</p>


<h3>After:</h3>
<p class="wide">They legally gained the right to vote, though enforcement took nearly a century to fully realize.</p>


<h2>16th Amendment (1913)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 16th Amendment gives Congress the power to levy and collect taxes on income, without apportioning it among the states or basing it on the U.S. Census.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>
<p class="wide">Before the 16th Amendment, the federal government relied mainly on tariffs and excise taxes. Attempts to impose a federal income tax were limited by legal challenges.</p>

<p class="wide">In Pollock v. Farmers‚Äô Loan & Trust Co. (1895), the Supreme Court ruled that certain income taxes were unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="wide">The 16th Amendment clarified Congress‚Äôs power to tax income directly, making a modern federal income tax possible.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide"> Ratified on February 3, 1913.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<p class="wide">Direct Income Tax: Congress can tax personal and corporate income directly.</p>
<p class="wide">No Apportionment Required: Taxes do not need to be divided among the states based on population.</p>
<p class="wide">Foundation of Federal Revenue: Enables the federal government to fund programs, infrastructure, military, and social services.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Federal Budget: Allowed the creation of a reliable and flexible source of revenue for the federal government.</p>

<p class="wide">Income Tax System: Led to the modern IRS system and progressive taxation policies.</p>

<p class="wide">Economic Influence: Enabled funding for major programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and other federal initiatives.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before:</h3>
<p class="wide">The federal government mainly funded itself through tariffs on imports.</p>

<h3>After:</h3>
<p class="wide">Congress could impose a federal income tax on individuals and corporations, creating a consistent revenue stream.</p>

<p class="wide">Here‚Äôs a clear explanation of the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:</p>

<h2>17th Amendment (1913</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 17th Amendment establishes the direct election of U.S. Senators by the people, rather than by state legislatures.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>
<p class="wide">Originally, Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution gave state legislatures the power to choose U.S. Senators.</p>

<p class="wide">This system led to corruption, political deadlocks, and influence by special interests, as some legislatures were bribed or gridlocked in selecting senators.</p>

<p class="wide">The 17th Amendment shifted the power to voters, increasing democratic participation.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on April 8, 1913.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<p class="wide">Direct Election: Citizens of each state vote directly for their U.S. Senators.</p>
<p class="wide">Vacancies: Governors can appoint temporary senators until a special election occurs.</p>
<p class="wide">Democratic Reform: Reduces corruption and increases accountability to the public.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Increased Democracy: People now have a direct voice in choosing Senators.</p>
<p class="wide">Reduced State Legislature Influence: Senators no longer rely on state legislators for election, making them more responsive to public opinion.</p>
<p class="wide">Political Reform: Part of the broader Progressive Era reforms that expanded citizen participation and curbed political corruption.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before 17th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">State legislatures could deadlock for months, leaving Senate seats empty.</p>

<h3>After 17th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Voters directly elect their Senators, ensuring representation aligns with the electorate‚Äôs choice.</p>


<h2>18th Amendment (1919)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 18th Amendment prohibited the manufacture, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquors in the United States. This is commonly known as Prohibition.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>

<p class="wide">Part of the Temperance Movement, which argued that alcohol led to crime, poverty, and family problems.</p>

<p class="wide">Social reformers and religious groups pushed for national prohibition.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on January 16, 1919.</p>

<p class="wide">Enforcement began in 1920 under the Volstead Act, which defined ‚Äúintoxicating liquors‚Äù and outlined penalties.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<p class="wide">Prohibition: Banned production, sale, and transportation of alcohol.</p>
<p class="wide">Federal Enforcement: The government could enforce the ban through fines and imprisonment.</p>
<p class="wide">No Ban on Consumption: The amendment did not criminalize drinking alcohol, only its production and sale.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Rise of Organized Crime: Illegal alcohol trade (‚Äúbootlegging‚Äù) flourished, leading to gang violence.</p>

<p class="wide">Public Discontent: Many people ignored Prohibition, causing widespread law-breaking.</p>

<p class="wide">Repeal: Seen as unsuccessful, the 18th Amendment was repealed by the 21st Amendment in 1933, the only U.S. amendment to be fully repealed.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p class="wide">Speakeasies (illegal bars) became common in cities like Chicago and New York.</p>
<p class="wide">Al Capone and other gangsters profited massively from the illegal liquor trade.</p>


<h2>19th Amendment (1920)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">
The 19th Amendment grants women the right to vote, prohibiting the federal and state governments from denying the vote based on sex.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>
<p class="wide">Women‚Äôs suffrage movements had been active for decades, campaigning for equal voting rights.</p>
<p class="wide">The push gained momentum in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in national reform.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on August 18, 1920, following decades of activism by leaders like Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Carrie Chapman Catt.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<p class="wide">Voting Rights for Women: Women nationwide could now vote in federal, state, and local elections.</p>

<p class="wide">Federal and State Compliance: No government at any level could legally deny voting rights based on sex.</p>

<p class="wide">Part of Progressive Era Reforms: Expanded democracy and civil rights during the early 20th century.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Political Participation: Dramatically increased the electorate and women‚Äôs influence in politics.</p>

<p class="wide">Social Change: Helped pave the way for greater gender equality in education, employment, and law.</p>

<p class="wide">Legacy: The amendment is a cornerstone of women‚Äôs rights in the United States.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before the 19th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Women were largely barred from voting in most states.</p>

<h3>After the 19th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Women could vote in the 1920 presidential election, with millions casting ballots nationwide.</p>

<p class="wide">Here‚Äôs a clear explanation of the 20th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:</p>

<h2>20th Amendment (1933)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 20th Amendment changes the dates for the start of presidential, vice-presidential, and congressional terms and addresses what happens if there is a presidential or vice-presidential vacancy. It‚Äôs often called the ‚ÄúLame Duck Amendment.‚Äù</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>

<p class="wide">Before the 20th Amendment, the president and Congress took office in March, four months after the election.</p>

<p class="wide">This long ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù period caused delays in governance and limited accountability.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on January 23, 1933.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>

<p class="wide">New Start Dates: Presidential and Vice Presidential terms now begin on January 20. Congressional terms now begin on January 3.</p>

<p class="wide">Presidential Vacancy: If the President-elect dies before taking office, the Vice President-elect becomes President.</p>

<p class="wide">Congress can provide for other contingencies if neither is qualified. Congressional sessions requires Congress to meet at least once per year.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Reduces Lame Duck Periods: Ensures newly elected officials take office sooner, improving government responsiveness.</p>

<p class="wide">Continuity of Government: Provides clear rules for presidential succession before inauguration.</p>

<p class="wide">Efficiency: Helps government act faster during crises, like the Great Depression, which motivated its ratification.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before 20th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">A president elected in November had to wait until March to take office‚Äîfour months of a lame duck administration.</p>

<h3>After 20th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">The new president takes office on January 20, shortening the transition period.</p>

<h2>21st Amendment (1933)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 21st Amendment repeals the 18th Amendment, ending Prohibition, and gives states the power to regulate the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol within their borders.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 18th Amendment (1919) prohibited alcohol, but enforcement failed.</p>

<p class="wide">Widespread illegal production and sales (‚Äúbootlegging‚Äù) led to organized crime and public discontent.</p>

<p class="wide">Repealing Prohibition became a national priority during the Great Depression to stimulate the economy and create jobs.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on December 5, 1933.</p>

<p class="wide">The only U.S. amendment ever fully repealed.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<p class="wide">Repeal of Prohibition: Legalizes the production, sale, and transportation of alcohol.</p>

<p class="wide">State Authority: States can regulate alcohol independently, including bans or licensing.</p>
<p class="wide">Federal Enforcement: While the federal government can regulate interstate commerce, states have primary control over alcohol within their borders.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p class="wide">End of Prohibition: Bars, breweries, and distilleries reopened.</p>
<p class="wide">Economic Boost: Generated tax revenue and employment during the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="wide">State Variation: Some states continued restrictions (e.g., ‚Äúdry‚Äù counties), but nationwide prohibition ended.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before 21st Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Alcohol production and sales were illegal nationwide, leading to speakeasies and organized crime.</p>


<h3>After 21st Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Alcohol became legal again, but states could set their own rules on sales and distribution.</p>


<h2>22nd Amendment (1951)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 22nd Amendment limits the President of the United States to two elected terms in office, or a maximum of ten years if they came to office via succession.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>

<p class="wide">Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected four times (1932‚Äì1944), breaking the two-term precedent set by George Washington.</p>

<p class="wide">After Roosevelt‚Äôs presidency, Congress and the public sought to formalize the two-term limit to prevent overly long presidencies.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on February 27, 1951.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>

<p class="wide">Two-Term Limit: A president can be elected only twice.</p>
<p class="wide">Maximum Ten Years: If a Vice President or other successor serves more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected, they may only be elected once more.</p>

<p class="wide">Applies to Future Presidents: Presidents in office at the time of ratification were not immediately affected (e.g., Harry Truman could have run again).</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Prevents Extended Presidencies: Ensures regular leadership changes and limits concentration of executive power.</p>

<p class="wide">Formalizes Tradition: Codifies the two-term precedent that had been informally followed since George Washington.</p>

<p class="wide">Political Strategy: Influences presidential succession planning and campaign strategy.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before 22nd Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Franklin D. Roosevelt served four terms.</p>


<h3>After 22nd Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Presidents like Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy were limited to two terms, following the formal rule.</p>

<h2>23rd Amendment (1961) ‚Äì Overview</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 23rd Amendment grants residents of Washington, D.C., the right to vote in presidential elections by giving the District a number of electors in the Electoral College, as if it were a state (though no more than the least populous state).</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3> 

<p class="wide">Residents of Washington, D.C. could not vote for President because the Constitution only provided electors for states.</p>

<p class="wide">As the capital grew, there was increasing demand for representation in presidential elections.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on March 29, 1961.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>

<p class="wide">Electoral Votes:</p>
<p class="wide">D.C. is allocated electors equal to the least populous state, currently 3 electoral votes.</p>

<p class="wide">Participation in Presidential Elections:</p>

<p class="wide">Citizens of the District can now vote for President and Vice President.</p>

<p class="wide">Limitations:</p>

<p class="wide">D.C. does not have voting representation in Congress (no Senators or voting Representatives).</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Voting Rights: Residents of D.C. gained a voice in presidential elections.</p>

<p class="wide">Symbolic and Practical: While limited in Congressional representation, the amendment ensures participation in national leadership selection.</p>

<p class="wide">Political Relevance: D.C.‚Äôs electoral votes often influence close presidential races.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before 23rd Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Residents of D.C. could not vote for President.</p>

<h3>After 23rd Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Citizens of D.C. could cast votes for President, contributing to the Electoral College outcome.</p>

<h2>24th Amendment (1964)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 24th Amendment prohibits the use of poll taxes in federal elections, ensuring that the right to vote cannot be denied for failing to pay a tax or fee.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>
<p class="wide">Many Southern states used poll taxes as a tool to suppress African American voters and poor citizens.</p>

<p class="wide">The Civil Rights Movement highlighted these injustices, leading Congress and the states to act.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on January 23, 1964.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>

<p class="wide">No Poll Taxes in Federal Elections: Citizens cannot be required to pay a tax to vote in federal elections (President, Vice President, and Congress).</p>

<p class="wide">Congressional Enforcement: Congress has the power to enforce the amendment through legislation.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Voting Rights Expansion: Made it easier for low-income and African American citizens to vote in federal elections.</p>

<p class="wide">Civil Rights Milestone: Helped pave the way for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which banned other discriminatory practices.</p>

<p class="wide">State Elections Later Affected: Although initially only for federal elections, courts later extended this principle to state and local elections.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before 24th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Citizens in some states had to pay a poll tax to vote, effectively disenfranchising many African Americans and poor people.</p>

<h3>After 24th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Poll taxes could no longer block anyone from voting in federal elections.</p>

<h2>25th Amendment (1967) ‚Äì Overview</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 25th Amendment clarifies presidential succession and procedures for filling a vacancy in the vice presidency, and provides rules if the President is unable to perform their duties.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>

<p class="wide">The Constitution originally had limited guidance on presidential succession and disability.</p>

<p class="wide">Issues arose when Presidents died in office (e.g., John F. Kennedy in 1963) or became incapacitated.</p>


<p class="wide">The amendment was designed to ensure continuity of government.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on February 10, 1967.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>

<p class="wide">Presidential Vacancy: If the President dies, resigns, or is removed, the Vice President becomes President.</p>

<p class="wide">Vice Presidential Vacancy: The President nominates a new Vice President, who must be confirmed by a majority of both Houses of Congress.</p>

<p class="wide">Presidential Disability: If the President is unable to perform duties, the Vice President becomes Acting President.</p>

<p class="wide">The President can resume duties by notifying Congress when able.</p>
<p class="wide">Declaration by Cabinet or Congress: If the President disputes the disability, Congress decides whether the Vice President continues as Acting President.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Ensures Continuity of Leadership: Provides clear procedures if the President or Vice President cannot serve.</p>

<p class="wide">Addresses Modern Crises: Applied during situations like Presidential surgeries, illnesses, or temporary incapacitation.</p>

<p class="wide">Reduces Uncertainty: Eliminates ambiguity in presidential succession and disability.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p class="wide">Vacancy: When Spiro Agnew resigned as Vice President in 1973, Gerald Ford was nominated and confirmed as Vice President under the 25th Amendment.</p>

<p class="wide">Disability: When Ronald Reagan underwent surgery in 1985, he temporarily transferred power to Vice President George H. W. Bush as Acting President.</p>

<h2>26th Amendment (1971)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 26th Amendment grants the right to vote to citizens who are 18 years of age or older, prohibiting age-based restrictions for voting in federal, state, or local elections.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>
<p class="wide">During the Vietnam War, many young Americans aged 18‚Äì20 were eligible for military draft but could not vote.</p>

<p class="wide">There was growing pressure to allow young adults to have a say in elections that could send them to war.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on July 1, 1971.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>

<p class="wide">Voting Age: Citizens 18 years or older cannot be denied the right to vote based on age.</p>

<p class="wide">Applies Nationwide: Applies to federal, state, and local elections.</p>
<p class="wide">Enforcement: Congress can pass laws to enforce the amendment.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p class="wide">Expanded Democracy: Millions of young Americans gained the right to vote.</p>
<p class="wide">Political Influence: Youth became a significant political force in elections.</p>
<p class="wide">Response to Social Movements: Addressed inequalities between responsibilities (military service) and rights (voting).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before 26th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">A 19-year-old could be drafted into the military but could not vote in elections.</p>

<h3>After 26th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">Citizens aged 18‚Äì20 could vote in all elections, aligning rights with responsibilities.</p>

<h2>27th Amendment (1992)</h2>
<h3>Text:</h3>

<p class="wide">The 27th Amendment prevents any law that increases or decreases the salary of members of Congress from taking effect until after the next election of Representatives.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why it was adopted:</h3>

<p class="wide">Concerned that Congress could vote itself immediate pay raises without accountability to voters.</p>
<p class="wide">Originally proposed in 1789 as part of the Bill of Rights, but not ratified until 1992 after a renewed campaign.</p>

<h3>Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Ratified on May 7, 1992, more than 200 years after its proposal.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions</h2>
<p class="wide">Delayed Effect of Congressional Pay Changes:</p>

<p class="wide">Any salary change for Congress members takes effect only after the next House election.</p>
<p class="wide">Applies to All Members:</p>

<p class="wide">Ensures both the House and Senate are included.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p class="wide">Accountability: Congress cannot immediately benefit from a pay raise they approve.</p>
<p class="wide">Transparency: Voters can respond in the next election if they disapprove of salary changes.</p>
<p class="wide">Stability: Prevents rapid or arbitrary adjustments to Congressional compensation.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Before 27th Amendment (or without it):</h3>
<p class="wide">Congress could vote to raise their pay immediately.</p>

<h3>After 27th Amendment:</h3>
<p class="wide">If Congress votes for a pay increase today, it won‚Äôt take effect until after the next election, allowing voters to express approval or disapproval.</p>

<h2>Article II ‚Äì Executive Branch</h2>

<p class="wide">
Purpose: Article II establishes the President and Vice President, the branch responsible for enforcing laws passed by Congress. It defines their powers, duties, election process, and qualifications, ensuring a strong yet limited executive.</p>

<p class="wide">Process: House of Representatives impeaches (brings charges). Senate holds the trial and votes on conviction (2/3 required to remove).</p>

<h3>Key Concepts of Article II</h3>

<p class="wide">Separation of Powers: President enforces laws but cannot make them (Congress) or interpret them (Courts).</p>

<p class="wide">Checks and Balances: Senate confirms appointments and ratifies treaties. Congress can override vetoes with 2/3 vote. Courts can declare executive actions unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="wide">Flexibility and Accountability: Powers allow the President to respond to emergencies, but limited by Senate, Congress, and law.</p>

<h2>Article III ‚Äì Judicial Branch</h2>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="wide">Article III creates the federal court system, establishes the Supreme Court, and defines the powers and jurisdiction of the judiciary. Its main goal is to interpret laws and ensure justice under the Constitution.</p>

<h3>Section 1 ‚Äì Federal Courts and Judges</h3>

Supreme Court: 

Establishes the Supreme Court as the highest court in the U.S.

Lower Courts:

Congress has the power to create lower federal courts as needed.

Judges‚Äô Terms:

Judges hold office during good behavior, effectively giving lifetime appointments.

This ensures judicial independence from political pressure.

Compensation:

Judges‚Äô salaries cannot be reduced during their tenure.

<h3>Section 2 ‚Äì Jurisdiction</h3>

Cases the Federal Courts Hear:
Federal courts can hear cases involving:

Constitutional questions (laws or actions conflicting with the Constitution).

Federal laws and treaties.

Maritime law (sea-related cases).

Disputes between states or citizens of different states.

Original vs. Appellate Jurisdiction:

Original jurisdiction: Supreme Court hears the case first (e.g., disputes between states).

Appellate jurisdiction: Supreme Court hears appeals from lower federal or state courts.

Trial by Jury:

All criminal trials (except impeachment) must be by jury.

Trials occur in the state where the crime occurred.

<h3>Section 3 ‚Äì Treason</h3>

Definition of Treason:

Levying war against the U.S. or aiding its enemies.

Requires overt acts, not just intentions.

Conviction Rules:

Requires confession in open court or testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act.

Punishment:

Congress can punish treason, but cannot punish family members (protects innocent relatives).

Key Concepts of Article III

Judicial Independence:

Lifetime appointments and salary protection prevent undue political influence.

Scope of Power:

Courts only decide cases and controversies, not hypothetical questions.

Checks and Balances:

Courts can declare laws unconstitutional (judicial review, established in Marbury v. Madison, 1803).

Cannot initiate laws or execute them‚Äîthey interpret laws passed by Congress and enforced by the President.

Protection Against Treason Abuse:

Narrow definition and strict evidence rules prevent misuse for political purposes.

Example

Supreme Court Case: Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ‚Äì Supreme Court declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional.

Original Jurisdiction: Dispute between New Jersey and New York over water boundaries goes directly to the Supreme Court.

Treason: Benedict Arnold committed treason during the Revolutionary War by aiding the British.

<h2>Article VII ‚Äì Ratification of the Constitution</h2>

<p class="wide">
Purpose: Article VII sets out how the Constitution would take effect, replacing the Articles of Confederation. It specifies the process by which the original 13 states agreed to adopt the Constitution.</p>

<h3>Key Provisions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Ratification Requirement</li>
	<li>State Conventions</li>
	<li>Immediate Effect</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ratification Requirement:</h3>

<p class="wide">
The Constitution would take effect once 9 of the 13 states approved it. This supermajority ensured broad support while allowing the new government to begin functioning.</p>

<h3>State Conventions:</h3>

<p class="wide">Ratification was done through special conventions in each state, not by state legislatures. This method allowed the people themselves, through elected delegates, to approve the Constitution.</p>

<h3>Immediate Effect:</h3>

<p class="wide">Once the required number of states ratified, the Constitution became the supreme law of the United States, replacing the Articles of Confederation.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<h3>Why Article VII Was Needed:</h3>

<ol>
<li>The Articles of Confederation required unanimous consent of all 13 states for changes.</li>
<li>The Framers wanted a faster, practical method for the new Constitution to take effect.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ratification Timeline:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Delaware was the first state to ratify on December 7, 1787.</li>
<li>New Hampshire was the ninth state, ratifying on June 21, 1788, making the Constitution effective.</li>
<li>By 1790, all 13 states had ratified.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Key Concepts of Article VII</h2>

<h3>Practical Ratification:</h3>
<p class="wide">Allowed the Constitution to take effect without unanimous consent, avoiding delays that plagued the Articles of Confederation.</p>

<h3>People‚Äôs Role:</h3>

<p class="wide">Emphasized that ratification is through state conventions representing the people, not just state governments.</p>

<h3>Foundation for Government:</h3>

<p class="wide">Article VII marks the formal beginning of the U.S. government under the Constitution.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<ul>
<li>Delaware: Ratified first, showing early support for a stronger federal government.</li>
<li>New Hampshire: Ninth to ratify, triggering the Constitution to go into effect in 1788.</li>
<li>All States: Eventually ratified, ensuring national unity under the new system.</li>
