      <h1>16th Amendment (1913)</h1>
      <p><em>“The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.”</em></p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Ratified on February 3, 1913, the <strong>Sixteenth Amendment</strong> gave Congress the constitutional authority to impose an income tax without distributing it among the states or basing it on the U.S. Census. This fundamentally changed how the federal government financed its operations and expanded its fiscal power.
      </p>

      <h2>Historical Background</h2>
      <p>
        Before the Sixteenth Amendment, federal revenues came primarily from tariffs and excise taxes. These disproportionately affected working-class Americans while allowing wealthier citizens to contribute little. The <strong>Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co. (1895)</strong> decision had struck down an earlier attempt at an income tax, ruling it unconstitutional.
      </p>
      <p>
        The growing Progressive movement demanded a fairer tax system — one that would place a larger burden on those with greater wealth. In response, Congress proposed and the states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, effectively overturning the Pollock ruling and legalizing a national income tax.
      </p>

      <h2>Legal and Political Impact</h2>
      <p>
        The Amendment marked a turning point in American governance, enabling the federal government to fund expansive programs, infrastructure projects, and later, the New Deal and wartime mobilizations. It shifted the balance of fiscal power toward Washington, D.C., reducing state financial independence.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also gave rise to the modern <strong>Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</strong> and permanently embedded income taxation into American life and law.
      </p>

      <h2>Modern Significance</h2>
      <p>
        The 16th Amendment remains one of the most consequential in U.S. history. It underpins federal budgets, social programs, and national defense. Debates about tax fairness, income inequality, and government spending all trace their legal roots back to this amendment.
      </p>

        “The power to tax involves the power to destroy.”
