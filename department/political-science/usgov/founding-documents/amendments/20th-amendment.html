      <h2>20th Amendment (1933)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified January 23, 1933 — Addresses terms of Congress, presidential inauguration, and succession.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Twentieth Amendment reduced the "lame duck" period between election and inauguration for Congress and the President. It moved the presidential inauguration from March 4 to January 20 and the start of congressional terms to January 3. It also clarified presidential succession in the event of death or disability before taking office.

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January...<br>
        Section 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year...<br>
        Section 3. If the President-elect dies before the beginning of the term, the Vice President-elect shall become President...<br>
        Section 4. This article shall be inoperative unless ratified within seven years.”
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Before the 20th Amendment, long "lame duck" sessions allowed outgoing legislators and presidents to remain in power for months after losing elections. This sometimes led to ineffective governance or policy stagnation. The amendment was proposed during the Great Depression to ensure newly elected officials could act quickly to address national crises.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        By shortening the transition period and clarifying succession, the 20th Amendment strengthened government responsiveness and stability. It remains critical in ensuring continuity of leadership and orderly transfer of power in the United States.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should examine the political and social consequences of lame duck sessions, study the historical context of the Great Depression, and review cases of presidential succession influenced by this amendment.
