      <h2>27th Amendment (1992)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Proposed 1789 — Ratified 1992 — Delays congressional pay changes.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Twenty-seventh Amendment prevents any law that increases or decreases the salary of members of Congress from taking effect until after the next election of Representatives. This ensures that Congress cannot immediately vote to raise or lower its own pay without accountability to voters.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.”
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Proposed in 1789 as part of the original Bill of Rights debates, the amendment was not ratified until 1992, over 200 years later. Its purpose was to prevent Congress from giving itself immediate pay raises, encouraging accountability to voters before salary changes take effect.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The 27th Amendment remains a safeguard against self-serving legislation by Congress. By delaying changes to legislative salaries, it reinforces the principle of representative accountability and ensures that members of Congress remain answerable to the electorate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should examine the historical journey of this amendment from 1789 to 1992, and analyze its implications for congressional accountability and legislative ethics.
