    <h2>Thirteenth Amendment (1865)</h2>
    <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified 1865 — Abolishment of slavery and involuntary servitude</p>

    <p class="wide">
      The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution formally abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. It was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified by the states on December 6, 1865, marking the legal end of slavery in the United States after more than two centuries of enslavement.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      This amendment fulfilled the moral and political promise of the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation. While President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 had freed slaves in the Confederate states, it was a wartime measure and did not permanently outlaw slavery nationwide. The Thirteenth Amendment made abolition permanent, binding, and constitutional.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="amendment-text">
    <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
    <p class="wide"><em><b>
      “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
      <br><br>
      Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”
    </b></em></p>

    <p class="wide">
      In essence, the amendment ended chattel slavery and gave Congress authority to pass laws ensuring its enforcement. However, the “punishment clause” allowed forms of forced labor in prisons, which has sparked ongoing debate about its legacy and modern implications.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
    <p class="wide">
      The Thirteenth Amendment emerged directly from the Civil War and the nation’s struggle to reconcile liberty with equality. For decades, the Constitution had tolerated slavery through compromises that divided North and South. The Civil War exposed that contradiction, forcing the nation to choose between preserving slavery or fulfilling its founding ideals.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      Its passage required immense political will, particularly in the House of Representatives, where it narrowly succeeded after passionate debate. The amendment not only ended slavery but also provided constitutional authority for future civil rights legislation, laying the foundation for the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments that followed during Reconstruction.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Further Study</h2>
    <p class="wide">
      Students exploring the Thirteenth Amendment should examine primary sources such as Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, the debates in Congress in 1865, and later Supreme Court interpretations. More resources can be found in the <a href="../../../law/constitutional/home">Constitutional Law</a> and <a href="../../../history/civil-war/home">Civil War</a> sections of the Malone Global University Library.
