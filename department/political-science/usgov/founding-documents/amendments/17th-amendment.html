      <h2>17th Amendment (1913)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified April 8, 1913 — Established the direct election of U.S. Senators by the people.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Seventeenth Amendment transformed the method of selecting U.S. Senators from appointment by state legislatures to direct election by popular vote. This was part of the broader <strong>Progressive Era reforms</strong> aimed at curbing corruption and making government more accountable to the people.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote...”
      </b></em></p>
      <p class="wide">
        The amendment also outlines procedures for filling vacancies through special elections or temporary gubernatorial appointments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Prior to the 17th Amendment, senators were chosen by state legislatures, a system that often led to <strong>deadlocks, bribery, and corruption</strong>. Critics argued that powerful interests, rather than voters, controlled Senate selections. Reformers sought to return political power to citizens through direct elections.
      </p>

      <p class="wide">
        The amendment was part of the <strong>Progressive Movement’s efforts</strong> to make the U.S. government more democratic and transparent, alongside other reforms like women’s suffrage and the initiative/referendum process.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The 17th Amendment shifted the balance of power between state and federal governments. While it reduced state legislatures’ influence over national policy, it increased the Senate’s democratic legitimacy. Some modern critics argue it weakened federalism by cutting a direct link between states and the Senate.
      </p>

      <p class="wide">
        Today, the direct election of senators is seen as a cornerstone of American democracy, ensuring greater representation and accountability to the electorate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        To understand the 17th Amendment in context, students should study the <a href="../../law/constitutional/cases/smiley-v-holm">Smiley v. Holm (1932)</a> decision and compare it with earlier state selection methods under the original Constitution.
