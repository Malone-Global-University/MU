      <h2>25th Amendment (1967)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified February 10, 1967 — Addresses presidential succession, vice presidential vacancies, and presidential disability.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Twenty-fifth Amendment establishes clear procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of Vice President, and outlines processes for handling situations where the President is unable to perform duties due to disability. This amendment was motivated by ambiguities revealed during presidential incapacities and assassinations.
      </p>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        The 25th Amendment has four sections: 
        <ol>
          <li>If the President dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the Vice President becomes President.</li>
          <li>Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President nominates a replacement, confirmed by a majority of both Houses of Congress.</li>
          <li>Whenever the President transmits a written declaration that they are unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, the Vice President acts as President.</li>
          <li>If the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet or another body designated by Congress declare the President unable, the Vice President assumes powers as Acting President.</li>
        </ol>
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The 25th Amendment was proposed following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and concerns over clarity in presidential succession. Before this amendment, the Constitution was vague on filling vice presidential vacancies and handling presidential disability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The amendment has provided legal clarity in cases of presidential resignation, temporary disability, and vice presidential succession. It ensures continuity of executive authority and stability of governance during crises.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should examine historical instances invoking the 25th Amendment, such as vice presidential appointments and temporary transfers of power, and evaluate its role in maintaining constitutional continuity.
