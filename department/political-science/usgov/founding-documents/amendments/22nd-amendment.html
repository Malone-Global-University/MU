      <h2>22nd Amendment (1951)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified February 27, 1951 — Limits Presidents to two elected terms in office.</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Twenty-second Amendment restricts any person from being elected to the office of President more than twice. This law was motivated by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four-term presidency, which broke the longstanding two-term tradition set by George Washington.
      </p>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. This article shall be inoperative unless ratified within seven years from the date of submission.”
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The amendment was proposed to prevent concentration of power in the presidency and to formalize the two-term tradition. It followed the unprecedented four-term presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt and reflected concerns about executive overreach and political stability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact and Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        By codifying presidential term limits, the 22nd Amendment ensures regular leadership turnover, preserving democratic norms. It has guided the expectations and strategy of modern presidential campaigns and succession planning.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Further Study</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Students should study presidential term traditions prior to 1951, analyze Roosevelt's four-term presidency, and consider debates about executive power and term-limit reform in contemporary politics.
