    <h2>Twelfth Amendment (1804)</h2>
    <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified June 15, 1804 ‚Äî Reforms the process for electing the President and Vice President.</p>

    <p class="wide">
      The Twelfth Amendment modified the original process for electing the President and Vice President described in Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. 
      It was enacted after the chaotic election of 1800, in which Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied with the same number of electoral votes. 
      The amendment required separate ballots for President and Vice President to prevent such confusion in the future.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      This reform fundamentally changed how the Electoral College operates, ensuring that presidential and vice-presidential candidates run together on a unified ticket, 
      rather than being selected independently. It reflected the growing influence of political parties in the young republic.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="amendment-text">
    <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
    <p class="wide"><em><b>
      ‚ÄúThe Electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves...‚Äù
    </b></em></p>

    <p class="wide">
      The Amendment continues to outline the procedures for counting votes, handling ties, and clarifying the roles of the House of Representatives and Senate 
      in the event no candidate receives a majority. The House chooses the President from the top three candidates, while the Senate selects the Vice President 
      from the top two for that office.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      The Twelfth Amendment ensures a clearer and more democratic process for presidential elections by adapting to the realities of political parties 
      and preventing power struggles like those of 1800.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
    <p class="wide">
      The Amendment arose from the election crisis of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr‚Äîrunning mates from the same political party‚Äîreceived an equal number of electoral votes. 
      The tie sent the election to the House of Representatives, where it took 36 ballots to declare Jefferson the winner. 
      The ordeal exposed flaws in the original electoral system, which hadn‚Äôt anticipated organized political parties.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      The 12th Amendment solved this by requiring electors to cast separate votes for President and Vice President, aligning the Constitution with the emerging two-party system. 
      It strengthened the stability and legitimacy of presidential elections while reducing the risk of deadlock or manipulation.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      In essence, the 12th Amendment modernized the Electoral College and made executive elections more predictable and representative.
    </p>
