      <h2>14th Amendment (1868)</h2>
      <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified July 9, 1868 — Citizenship, Equal Protection, and Due Process</p>

      <p class="wide">
        The Fourteenth Amendment is one of the most significant constitutional changes in U.S. history. Ratified after the Civil War, it defined U.S. citizenship and prohibited states from denying any person “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” or denying anyone within their jurisdiction “equal protection of the laws.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="amendment-text">
      <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
      <p class="wide"><em><b>
        “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
      </b></em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The 14th Amendment was part of the Reconstruction Amendments passed after the Civil War. It was designed to secure the rights of formerly enslaved people and to prevent southern states from enacting discriminatory laws. By defining national citizenship and extending federal protection of civil rights, the amendment transformed the relationship between the states and the federal government.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Major Clauses and Legal Impact</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The amendment contains several key provisions:
        <ul class="wide">
          <li><b>Citizenship Clause:</b> Grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S., overturning the Dred Scott decision.</li>
          <li><b>Due Process Clause:</b> Prevents states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without fair legal procedures.</li>
          <li><b>Equal Protection Clause:</b> Requires states to treat individuals equally under the law, forming the basis for many landmark civil rights cases.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Modern Significance</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        The 14th Amendment is the foundation of modern civil rights law. It underpins major Supreme Court rulings such as <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954), which ended racial segregation, and <em>Roe v. Wade</em> (1973), concerning privacy and liberty. Its broad language allows continuous reinterpretation as society’s understanding of equality evolves.
