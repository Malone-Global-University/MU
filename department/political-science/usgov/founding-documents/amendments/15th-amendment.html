    <h2>Fifteenth Amendment (1870)</h2>
    <p class="amendment-meta">Ratified February 3, 1870 ‚Äî Prohibits denying the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.</p>

    <p class="wide">
      The Fifteenth Amendment extended the promise of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments by ensuring that the right to vote 
      could not be denied on account of race. It was a landmark in the struggle for equality following the Civil War, 
      aimed at securing political power and representation for formerly enslaved African Americans.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      However, despite its bold language, the Amendment faced systematic obstruction. States in the South quickly adopted discriminatory practices ‚Äî 
      such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses ‚Äî to suppress Black voters. 
      This led to nearly a century of disenfranchisement until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 enforced its true spirit.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="amendment-text">
    <h2>Text of the Amendment</h2>
    <p class="wide"><em><b>
      ‚ÄúSection 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States 
      or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.<br><br>
      Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.‚Äù
    </b></em></p>

    <p class="wide">
      In essence, this Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in voting and empowers Congress to create laws protecting that right.
      It was the first step toward universal suffrage, though women and Indigenous people were still excluded from the franchise at the time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Purpose and Historical Context</h2>
    <p class="wide">
      The Fifteenth Amendment completed the Reconstruction Amendments trilogy, alongside the 13th (abolishing slavery) 
      and the 14th (granting citizenship and equal protection). It was meant to guarantee political participation 
      as the final safeguard of freedom ‚Äî recognizing that without the vote, liberty could be taken away again.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      Its passage was a triumph of the Radical Republicans in Congress who sought to secure the rights of freedmen after the Civil War. 
      Yet its promise was immediately undermined by state resistance and federal neglect. 
      The rise of Jim Crow laws in the late 19th century effectively nullified much of the Amendment‚Äôs impact until the Civil Rights Movement reignited its enforcement.
    </p>

    <p class="wide">
      The 15th Amendment stands today as both a triumph and a warning ‚Äî a reminder that rights must be defended, not just declared.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
    <p class="wide">
      The principles of the Fifteenth Amendment continue to guide modern debates over voter suppression, 
      gerrymandering, and election integrity. Cases such as <em>Shelby County v. Holder (2013)</em> 
      have tested the limits of congressional power to enforce the Amendment. 
      Many activists and scholars argue that the fight to preserve the right to vote ‚Äî regardless of race or circumstance ‚Äî 
      remains one of the defining challenges of American democracy.

    <h2>Further Study</h2>
    <p class="wide">
      To explore this topic in depth, review the Reconstruction era, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Supreme Court decisions 
      related to election law and civil rights. Additional resources can be found in the 
      <a href="../../law/constitutional/home">Constitutional Law</a> section and within the 
      <a href="../home">U.S. Government</a> department.
