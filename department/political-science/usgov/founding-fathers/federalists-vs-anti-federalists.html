<main>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Federalists supported the ratification of the U.S. Constitution to create a strong national government, while the Anti-Federalists opposed it, fearing that a powerful central government would threaten individual liberties and states' rights. This debate was central to the Constitution's ratification, and Anti-Federalist pressure led to the creation of the Bill of Rights to protect individual freedoms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Federalists</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Federalists advocated for a strong, centralized national government to replace the weak Articles of Confederation. They believed a powerful government was necessary to manage the economy, maintain stability, and defend the nation.</p>

  <h3>Core Beliefs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong central government: Needed for national stability and enforcement of laws.</li>
    <li>National taxes: To pay war debts and fund the government.</li>
    <li>"Necessary and Proper" Clause: Supported implied powers for governance.</li>
    <li>Elitist rule: Government should be led by educated, wealthy men.</li>
    <li>No initial Bill of Rights: Believed the Constitution already protected liberties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Figures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Alexander Hamilton — Lead author of the Federalist Papers, championed national government and bank.</li>
    <li>James Madison — Key Federalist Papers author; later drafted the Bill of Rights.</li>
    <li>John Jay — Federalist Papers author and first Chief Justice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p class="wide">To ratify the Constitution and establish a unified, stable nation with a strong federal government.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Anti-Federalists</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Anti-Federalists feared a strong central government could become tyrannical, infringing on states’ rights and individual liberties. They advocated for local control and explicit protections for citizens.</p>

  <h3>Core Beliefs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong state governments: More representative of the people.</li>
    <li>Against national taxes: Concern for small farmers and the poor.</li>
    <li>Strict constructionism: Government powers limited to those explicitly granted.</li>
    <li>Protections for liberties: Advocated for a Bill of Rights.</li>
    <li>Fear of a standing army: Could threaten personal freedom.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Figures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Patrick Henry — Opposed Constitution, feared monarchy-like rule.</li>
    <li>George Mason — Refused to sign Constitution without Bill of Rights.</li>
    <li>Mercy Otis Warren — Criticized Constitution through essays.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p class="wide">To oppose ratification as written, press for a Bill of Rights, and maintain state authority and individual freedoms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Other Anti-Federalist Groups</h2>
  <p class="wide">Opposition also came from small farmers, rural communities, delegates from small states, and supporters of the Articles of Confederation. Their shared concern was that a distant, powerful federal government could threaten liberty and state sovereignty.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Legacy of the Debate</h2>
  <p class="wide">Federalists succeeded in ratifying the Constitution, but Anti-Federalists influenced the creation of the Bill of Rights in 1791. Their disagreements laid the groundwork for America's first political parties and shaped ongoing debates about federal versus state power.</p>
