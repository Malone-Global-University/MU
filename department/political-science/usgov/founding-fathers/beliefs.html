  <h2>How Their Positions Changed Over Time</h2>
  <p>Several key political figures experienced major ideological shifts as the new nation faced internal and external challenges:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>James Madison:</strong> Shifted from Federalist‑leaning nationalist to a leading Jeffersonian Republican as he opposed Hamilton’s centralized economic programs.</li>
    <li><strong>Thomas Jefferson:</strong> Became more pragmatic as president—supporting the Louisiana Purchase and limited use of federal power despite earlier strict‑construction views.</li>
    <li><strong>George Washington:</strong> Became increasingly aligned with Federalist thinking due to political instability, foreign threats, and internal rebellions.</li>
    <li><strong>John Adams:</strong> Became more authoritarian (Alien & Sedition Acts) under fear of foreign subversion, contributing to the fall of the Federalist Party.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Critical Events That Caused Division</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Constitutional Convention (1787):</strong> Split Federalists and Anti‑Federalists on how strong the national government should be.</li>
    <li><strong>Hamilton’s Financial Plan (1790–1791):</strong> Divided Jefferson and Madison from Hamilton over assumption of state debts, the national bank, and excise taxes.</li>
    <li><strong>Shays’ Rebellion:</strong> Encouraged Federalists to call for stronger federal authority; Anti‑Federalists feared potential tyranny.</li>
    <li><strong>Whiskey Rebellion:</strong> Split Jeffersonians and Federalists on whether military force against citizens was legitimate.</li>
    <li><strong>French Revolution:</strong> Jeffersonians supported France; Federalists favored Britain for stability and trade.</li>
    <li><strong>Jay’s Treaty (1795):</strong> Deepened suspicion of Federalist ties to Britain.</li>
    <li><strong>Alien & Sedition Acts (1798):</strong> Caused national backlash and solidified Republican opposition to Federalist authoritarianism.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Political Aftermath</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The emergence of the <strong>First Party System</strong>: Federalists vs. Democratic‑Republicans.</li>
    <li>The transformation of Madison and Jefferson into leaders of an organized political party.</li>
    <li>Washington’s Farewell Address warning against partisan divisions—ironically at a time when political parties were already forming.</li>
    <li>The eventual collapse of the Federalist Party after 1800 due to unpopular policies and limited rural support.</li>
    <li>The Democratic‑Republicans’ long-term dominance, culminating in the "Era of Good Feelings" after the War of 1812.</li>
    <li>Ongoing debates over federal power, states’ rights, and economic policy that continued into the 19th century and shaped American political identity.</li>
