<section id="when-the-debate-started"><h2>When the Debate Started</h2>

<ul>
<li>1787: The Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia concluded in September 1787 with a proposed U.S. Constitution.</li>
<li>
<p>Late 1787 – 1788: Federalists and Anti-Federalists began their public debate during the state ratifying conventions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Federalists wrote the Federalist Papers (1787–1788) to argue for ratification.</li>
<li>Anti-Federalists wrote essays and gave speeches opposing the Constitution as it was proposed, urging for stronger protections for individual liberties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


</section>

<section id="when-the-debate-stopped"><h2>When the Debate Stopped</h2>

<ul>
<li>1788: The Constitution was ratified by the required nine states (New Hampshire ratified in June 1788, ensuring its adoption).</li>
<li>1789: The first U.S. Congress convened under the new Constitution, officially starting the new federal government.</li>
<li>1791: The Bill of Rights was ratified, largely addressing Anti-Federalist concerns about individual liberties.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="who-won"><h2>Who “Won”?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Federalists won the ratification battle: The Constitution became the law of the land, creating a strong national government.</li>
<li>Anti-Federalists won key concessions: Their persistent opposition led to the Bill of Rights, explicitly protecting freedom of speech, religion, due process, and other individual liberties.</li>
</ul>

<section id="federalists-after-ratification"><h2>Federalists After Ratification</h2>

<p>After the ratification of the Constitution, the Federalists and Anti-Federalists evolved in different ways, shaping the first political parties and early U.S. politics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Timeframe: Late 1780s – 1816 (gradual decline)</p>
<ul>
<li>The Federalists became the first organized political party in the U.S. under leaders like Alexander Hamilton and John Adams.</li>
<li>They advocated for a strong national government, a national bank, support for commerce and industry, and close ties with Britain.</li>
<li>Held significant power during George Washington’s presidency and John Adams’ presidency (1797–1801).</li>
<li>Their popularity declined after the War of 1812 and the rise of the Democratic-Republicans, who were more aligned with agrarian interests and states’ rights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="anti-federalists-after-ratification"><h2>Anti-Federalists After Ratification</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Timeframe: Late 1780s – early 1790s</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-Federalists did not form a formal political party immediately, but their ideas influenced the Democratic-Republican Party founded by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.</li>
<li>They continued to champion states’ rights, limited federal power, and individual liberties.</li>
<li>Their advocacy ensured that the Bill of Rights (1791) became part of the Constitution.</li>
<li>Many Anti-Federalists eventually integrated into the Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed Federalist economic and foreign policies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="long-term-legacy"><h2>Long-Term Legacy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Federalists: Laid the foundation for a strong central government and federal institutions, but their party dissolved after 1816.</li>
<li>Anti-Federalists: Influenced the creation of political opposition and shaped the principle of protecting civil liberties. Their ideas continue to influence debates about states’ rights vs. federal power.</li>
