      <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        George Washington was born in 1732 in Westmoreland County, Virginia. A surveyor, soldier, and planter, he rose to prominence during the French and Indian War. His reputation for discipline, honor, and leadership made him a natural candidate to command the Continental Army during the American Revolution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Political Beliefs & Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Washington believed in national unity, civic virtue, and a strong—but restrained—central government. Although he disliked political parties, his policies aligned closely with Federalist principles, especially regarding national finance, diplomacy, and executive authority.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How His Beliefs Changed Over Time</h2>
      <p class="wide">
        Initially cautious about centralized power, Washington gradually embraced stronger national authority as he witnessed the failures of the Articles of Confederation. As president, he supported Hamilton’s financial system and took decisive action during the Whiskey Rebellion to assert federal authority.
