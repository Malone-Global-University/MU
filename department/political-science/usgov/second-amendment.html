    <h1>The Second Amendment</h1>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Text</h2>
      <p><em>“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”</em></p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Bear Arms</strong>: Protects the individual’s right to possess and carry weapons.</li>
        <li><strong>Militia Clause</strong>: References the importance of a “well regulated Militia” for the security of the state.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Interpretation</strong>: Courts have debated whether this protects individual rights, collective rights through state militias, or both.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Historical Background</h2>
      <p>Ratified in 1791 as part of the <strong>Bill of Rights</strong>, the Second Amendment was influenced by colonial experiences with militias and fears of a standing army. It was intended to allow citizens to defend themselves, their communities, and their state governments.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
      <p>The Second Amendment remains central to debates on gun ownership, gun control, and public safety in the United States. Supreme Court rulings, such as <em>District of Columbia v. Heller (2008)</em>, have affirmed an individual’s right to possess firearms for lawful purposes, including self-defense at home.</p>
