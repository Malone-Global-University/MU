      <h2>Historical Background</h2>
      <p>Ratified in 1791 as part of the <strong>Bill of Rights</strong>, the First Amendment was influenced by Enlightenment ideas and colonial experiences under British restrictions. Its purpose was to ensure that citizens could freely express themselves, practice religion, and hold the government accountable.</p>

      <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
      <p>Today, the First Amendment covers a wide range of rights, including public protests, religious freedoms, journalism, and online expression. Courts continually interpret its boundaries, balancing protection of free expression with public safety, hate speech, and other concerns.</p>
