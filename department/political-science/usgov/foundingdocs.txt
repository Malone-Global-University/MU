We can approach The Declaration of Independence (1776) through several dimensions:

🧱 1. Structure of the Document

It’s divided into four main parts:

Introduction (Preamble) – Explains why the colonies are declaring independence.

“When in the Course of human events…”

Establishes the philosophy of natural rights and the social contract.

Philosophical Foundation (Statement of Beliefs) – Declares universal principles of liberty and equality.

“We hold these truths to be self-evident…”

Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke.

List of Grievances – Specific accusations against King George III, showing how he violated the colonists’ rights.

Over 25 grievances (e.g., taxation without consent, quartering troops, dissolving legislatures).

Formal Declaration of Independence – Announces that the colonies are now “free and independent States.”

⚖️ 2. Historical Context

Written in June–July 1776 by Thomas Jefferson with editing by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston (the “Committee of Five”).

Adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.

Rooted in Enlightenment thought — particularly natural rights, popular sovereignty, and the right of revolution.

Aimed both at Britain and the world, to justify the rebellion.
