      <h2>Context: The Rout at Petersham and the Flight North</h2>
      <p>
        After the failed assault on the Springfield armory (January 25, 1787) and the surprise attack at
        Petersham (early February), several leaders of the western Massachusetts uprising, including <strong>Luke Day</strong>,
        chose to flee rather than face mass arrest and likely harsh sentences. Many rebels crossed the border into
        the neighboring territory known at the time as the <strong>Republic of Vermont</strong> (1777–1791).
      </p>

      <h3>Why Vermont?</h3>
      <p>
        Vermont was functionally an independent republic with its own government, militia, and courts. Relations with
        Massachusetts were tense because of jurisdictional and border disputes. The new republic offered several
        advantages to fleeing rebels:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Political sympathy:</strong> Many Vermonters distrusted eastern Massachusetts elites and sympathized
          with the economic grievances of western farmers.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical safety:</strong> Vermont’s government declined to cooperate with Massachusetts extradition
          demands, providing effective shelter to fugitives.</li>
        <li><strong>Settlement opportunities:</strong> Vermont needed settlers and labor; Shaysites arriving with families
          and farm skills were useful additions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>A Farm Next to the Governor</h3>
      <p>
        In several accounts, Shaysite refugees settled on farms very near Governor <strong>Thomas Chittenden</strong>’s property.
        That fact has often been noted by contemporaries and later historians as symbolic: Vermont protected the rebels so
        openly that some lived literally next door to the governor’s own land. The proximity underscored how deliberately
        Vermont refused to hand over fugitives and how politically unacceptable extradition would have been for the republic.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Vermont Refused Extradition</h2>
      <p>
        Massachusetts demanded the return of Day, Shays, and other leaders, but Vermont declined. The reasons were
        several and interlocking:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Political independence and local sympathy.</strong> Vermont’s leaders viewed Massachusetts policy as oppressive
          and were reluctant to enforce its writs.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutrality and self-interest.</strong> Returning rebels would have signaled submission to Massachusetts and
          weakened Vermont’s negotiating position with Congress and neighboring states.</li>
        <li><strong>Veteran status and public opinion.</strong> Many refugees were Revolutionary veterans; Vermonters respected
          them and believed their hardships were legitimate.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical enforcement limits.</strong> Vermont could delay or ignore arrest warrants by using its courts and local
          officials—effectively blocking extradition without a formal asylum declaration.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Local Protection: How Vermont Sheltered Fugitives</h2>
      <p>
        Vermont’s protection was often informal but effective. Local sheriffs and justices delayed or refused to enforce
        Massachusetts warrants. Communities warned fugitives of approaching arrest parties and integrated many Shaysites
        into rural life. In some cases, Vermont quietly tolerated the rebels until political pressure from Massachusetts
        eased and pardons were offered.
      </p>

      <h2>Consequences and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Vermont’s refusal to extradite the rebels embarrassed Massachusetts and highlighted weaknesses in interstate law
        under the Articles of Confederation. The episode had several important consequences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It underscored the inability of the national government to resolve interstate disputes or enforce extradition.</li>
        <li>It strengthened arguments for a stronger federal system capable of managing crises that crossed state lines.</li>
        <li>It helped cement Vermont’s reputation as an independent polity with its own interests and willingness to defy
          neighboring authorities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Return and Reintegration</h2>
      <p>
        After Massachusetts eased penalties and Governor John Hancock issued pardons and tax relief, many former rebels
        returned home. Some stayed in Vermont permanently, contributing to the republic’s settlement and development.
