    <section id="1">
      <h2>1. Post-Revolution Economic Crisis</h2>
      <p>After the Revolutionary War, Massachusetts faced a severe fiscal crisis. The state moved to pay its debts quickly, demanding taxes in hard money (specie) and requiring full repayment of wartime notes. Continental and state notes had depreciated drastically—often to pennies on the dollar—leaving veterans and small farmers destitute. In Hampshire County, for example, roughly 31.4% of adult males were sued for debt between 1784–1786. The burden of a new, higher poll tax and a property-heavy tax code meant many could never hope to pay off obligations in their lifetimes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="2">
      <h2>2. Roots in Backcountry Resistance</h2>
      <p>Shays’s Rebellion drew on an older tradition of backcountry protest, notably the Regulators in North Carolina (1765–1771). Rural communities had long resisted distant elites and corrupt courts. Western Massachusetts farmers felt politically marginalized, with limited representation and laws that favored coastal merchants and creditors.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="3">
      <h2>3. Early Mobilization & Town Meetings</h2>
      <p>Towns organized emergency meetings: selectmen gathered in places like Pelham's Conkey Tavern and John Burse’s Inn to coordinate petitions and mutual defense. Local leaders—including Capt. Joseph Hines, Capt. Deacon John Thompson, Joel Billings, Colonel Seth Murray, John Hastings, Benjamin Eely, and William Pinchin—drafted lists of grievances and demands, culminating in about 21 articles calling for constitutional reform, court changes, tax revisions, and emergency legislative sessions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="4">
      <h2>4. First Court Shutdowns (Summer–Fall 1786)</h2>
      <p>Beginning in late August 1786, farmers began shutting county courts to stop foreclosure and debt cases. Notable early actions include the August 29 closure of the Northampton Court of Common Pleas, where some 1,500 protestors blocked proceedings, and the September 5–6 closures in Worcester and Springfield. These shutdowns were coordinated, disciplined actions intended to disrupt legal enforcement.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="5">
      <h2>5. Escalation: Courts Close Across Massachusetts</h2>
      <p>Throughout September–October 1786 and into winter, courts in Concord, Great Barrington, Taunton, Cambridge, and Lenox were blocked or forced to adjourn. Militia companies in many counties refused to act against the protesters and in some cases joined them, showing the breadth of sympathy for the Regulators across western Massachusetts.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="6">
      <h2>6. Political Reaction & Elite Backlash</h2>
      <p>Elites and some politicians condemned the Regulators as thieves, highwaymen, and dangerous plunderers. Samuel Adams, once a radical opponent of British rule, took a hardline stance—arguing that rebellion against a republic was treason. Others, like Moses Harvey, defected to the protestors. Tension between eastern merchants and western farmers became sharply personal and political.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="7">
      <h2>7. Government Crackdown</h2>
      <p>The state legislature passed emergency laws: the Riot Act authorized militia to fire on disobedient assemblies, and habeas corpus was suspended to allow detention without prompt trial. Arrest warrants were issued for prominent leaders. One high-profile arrest was Job Shattuck, a large landowner whose capture—after being beaten—symbolized the harshness of the government response.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="8">
      <h2>8. Bowdoin’s Private Army</h2>
      <p>With many militia units unwilling to fight, Governor James Bowdoin turned to private funding. Some 153 wealthy citizens raised funds to assemble a 4,400-man force under General Benjamin Lincoln. These privately financed troops, operating outside normal legislative authorization, would become the decisive force against the Regulators.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="9">
      <h2>9. Springfield Armory Confrontation (January 25, 1787)</h2>
      <p>Rebels planned to seize the Springfield arsenal. Lincoln marched to defend the armory; grapeshot and organized militia fire inflicted casualties and scattered the attackers. The failed assault marked the beginning of the rebellion’s military collapse.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="10">
      <h2>10. Petersham, Retreat, and Collapse</h2>
      <p>In early February 1787, Lincoln made a forced march to Petersham and surprised a rebel encampment. Many Regulators fled into northern refuges like Vermont. The military defeats, combined with arrests and legal penalties, effectively ended the active rebellion.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="11">
      <h2>11. Disqualification Act & Legal Measures (Feb 16, 1787)</h2>
      <p>The Disqualification Act required oaths of allegiance, mandated turning over of arms, and barred convicted participants from holding office, serving on juries, voting for officials, or working in certain trades for several years. Hundreds were tried for treason or sedition; most sentences were later commuted or pardoned.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="12">
      <h2>12. Pardons, Tax Relief, and Political Reconciliation</h2>
      <p>Governor Bowdoin’s harshness cost him politically; John Hancock won the 1787 election on a platform of leniency. Hancock and the new legislature issued pardons and eased taxes—cutting poll taxes and enacting temporary moratoria on debts—addressing some core grievances that had fueled the uprising.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="13">
      <h2>13. Veteran Involvement and Leadership</h2>
      <p>Many leaders and participants were Revolutionary War veterans who felt betrayed. Veterans like Daniel Shays, Luke Day, and others provided organization, military discipline, and legitimacy to the Regulators’ actions. Their presence made the rebellion especially alarming to national leaders.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="14">
      <h2>14. Vermont Refuge & Extradition Refusal</h2>
      <p>After the Petersham rout, numerous rebels fled to the Republic of Vermont, which refused Massachusetts’ extradition requests. Vermont’s sympathy, political independence, and need for settlers made it an effective refuge; some rebels settled near Governor Thomas Chittenden’s land and were sheltered until pardons were issued.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="15">
      <h2>15. National Consequences & Legacy</h2>
      <p>Shays’s Rebellion revealed the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation—particularly the national government’s inability to raise troops or resolve interstate disputes. The unrest helped galvanize support for the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention (1787). Federalists used the rebellion as evidence that a stronger central government was necessary to maintain order, while critics warned the new Constitution might entrench elite power. The event remains a crucial early test of American democracy and federal authority.</p>
