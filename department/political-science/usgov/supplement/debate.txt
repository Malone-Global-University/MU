Here’s a clear timeline and outcome for the Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist debate:

When the Debate Started

1787: The Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia concluded in September 1787 with a proposed U.S. Constitution.

Late 1787 – 1788: Federalists and Anti-Federalists began their public debate during the state ratifying conventions.

Federalists wrote the Federalist Papers (1787–1788) to argue for ratification.

Anti-Federalists wrote essays and gave speeches opposing the Constitution as it was proposed, urging for stronger protections for individual liberties.

When the Debate Stopped

1788: The Constitution was ratified by the required nine states (New Hampshire ratified in June 1788, ensuring its adoption).

1789: The first U.S. Congress convened under the new Constitution, officially starting the new federal government.

1791: The Bill of Rights was ratified, largely addressing Anti-Federalist concerns about individual liberties.

Who “Won”?

Federalists won the ratification battle: The Constitution became the law of the land, creating a strong national government.

Anti-Federalists won key concessions: Their persistent opposition led to the Bill of Rights, explicitly protecting freedom of speech, religion, due process, and other individual liberties.

Summary
Aspect	Federalists	Anti-Federalists
Timeline	1787–1788 (ratification debate)	1787–1791 (advocacy and pressure for Bill of Rights)
Goal	Ratify the Constitution, create strong federal government	Limit federal power, protect states’ rights and individual liberties
Outcome	Constitution ratified	Bill of Rights adopted

So technically, the Federalists “won” the political argument, but the Anti-Federalists shaped the Constitution’s protections, leaving a lasting legacy.
