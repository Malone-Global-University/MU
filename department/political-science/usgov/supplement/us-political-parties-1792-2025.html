            <h3>Federalist Party (c. 1792–1820)</h3>
            <p>Led by Alexander Hamilton and John Adams. Favored a strong national government, commercial policies, and close ties with Britain. Influence waned after the War of 1812 and it largely collapsed during the Era of Good Feelings.</p>
            <p class="meta">Key traits: centralizing, pro-commerce, banking-friendly.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Democratic-Republican Party (c. 1792–1828)</h3>
            <p>Founded by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison as a counter to Federalist policies. Emphasized states' rights, agrarianism, and limited federal power. The party later fractured into factions that birthed the modern Democratic Party and the National Republicans.</p>
            <p class="meta">Key traits: agrarian, states’ rights, anti-aristocratic.</p>

        <div class="party-list">
          <div class="party">
            <h3>Democratic Party (1828–present)</h3>
            <p>Emerging from Jacksonian democracy; early Democrats favored expansion, more power for state governments, and opposition to concentrated financial power. Over nearly two centuries the party's ideological center shifted multiple times, notably during the New Deal.</p>
            <p class="meta">Enduring party with broad ideological evolution.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="party">
            <h3>National Republican / Anti-Jackson (c. 1825–1833)</h3>
            <p>A coalition of anti-Jackson forces supporting national infrastructure and a stronger federal role in economic development. Many members later joined the Whig Party.</p>
            <p class="meta">Short-lived; precursor to the Whigs.</p>

            <h3>Whig Party (1833–1856)</h3>
            <p>Formed to oppose presidential power under Andrew Jackson. Supported Congressional supremacy, internal improvements, and often favored commercial interests. The Whigs split over slavery and dissolved in the 1850s.</p>
            <p class="meta">Important antebellum party that collapsed along sectional lines.</p>

            <h3>Republican Party (1854–present)</h3>
            <p>Founded by anti-slavery activists and former Whigs. Early Republicans promoted free labor, infrastructure, and modernization; the party became dominant in the North during and after the Civil War. Over the 20th century its coalition and ideology evolved into what is today the modern conservative party.</p>
            <p class="meta">Major party since the 1860s.</p>

            <p>Agrarian and anti-monopoly movement advocating direct election of senators, progressive income tax, and stronger regulation of railroads. Its platform influenced later Progressive Era reforms.</p>

            <p>Progressive third-party bids (Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 "Bull Moose" campaign and Robert La Follette's 1924 run) and the Socialist Party pushed ideas—regulation, labor protections, expanded democracy—that migrated into mainstream policy during the New Deal.</p>

            <h3>Democratic Party (New Deal onward)</h3>
            <p>From the 1930s, Democrats built a broad coalition (labor, minorities, intellectuals, urban voters) that enacted large-scale federal programs. The party continued to evolve on civil rights, economic policy, and social issues through the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>

            <p>Libertarian (1971–), Green (1991–), Constitution (1992–), Reform (1995–), and regional parties (Vermont Progressives, state fusion parties) have each influenced debate, ballot access rules, and policy in different states and moments. Many third parties act as policy incubators rather than sustained national contenders.</p>

          <h4>Notes for instructors & timeline builders</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Party names and coalitions shift — the same label (e.g., "Democratic") can mean very different coalitions and policies across centuries.</li>
            <li>Third parties are often best understood as policy innovators or protest candidacies that push major parties to adapt.</li>
            <li>For classroom timelines, consider anchoring changes to landmark events: the Civil War (1860s), the New Deal (1930s), the Civil Rights era (1960s), and the Reagan realignment (1980s).</li>
