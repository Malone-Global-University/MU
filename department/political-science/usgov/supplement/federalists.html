The Federalists supported the ratification of the U.S. Constitution to create a strong national government, while the Antifederalists opposed it, fearing a powerful central government would threaten individual liberties and states' rights. This debate was central to the ratification of the Constitution, and the Antifederalists' pressure led to the subsequent creation of the Bill of Rights to address their concerns about protecting individual freedoms. 
Federalists
Beliefs: Supported a strong, centralized government, believing it was necessary to manage national debt, enforce laws, and keep the country safe.
Leaders: Included prominent figures like Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, and James Madison.
Goals: To ratify the Constitution to establish a more unified and stable nation. 
Antifederalists
Beliefs: Feared that a strong national government would become too powerful, infringing on the rights of states and the people. They advocated for the power to remain with state and local governments, which they believed were more representative of the people.
Leaders: Included figures like George Clinton, Robert Yates, and Samuel Bryan.
Goals: To oppose the ratification of the Constitution as it was written, arguing for a Bill of Rights to be included to protect individual liberties. Their efforts were successful in forcing the first Congress to add the Bill of Rights.
