<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class="wide">The early debate over state rights versus federal rights was between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists. The Federalists supported the ratification of the U.S. Constitution to create a strong national government, while the Anti-Federalists opposed it, fearing that a powerful central government would threaten individual liberties and states' rights. This debate was central to the Constitution's ratification, and Anti-Federalist pressure led to the creation of the Bill of Rights to protect individual freedoms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Federalists</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Federalists advocated for a strong, centralized national government to replace the weak Articles of Confederation. They believed a powerful government was necessary to manage the economy, maintain stability, and defend the nation.</p>

  <h3>Core Beliefs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong central government: Needed for national stability and enforcement of laws.</li>
    <li>National taxes: To pay war debts and fund the government.</li>
    <li>"Necessary and Proper" Clause: Supported implied powers for governance.</li>
    <li>Elitist rule: Government should be led by educated, wealthy men.</li>
    <li>No initial Bill of Rights: Believed the Constitution already protected liberties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Figures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Alexander Hamilton — Lead author of the Federalist Papers, championed national government and bank.</li>
    <li>James Madison — Key Federalist Papers author; later drafted the Bill of Rights.</li>
    <li>John Jay — Federalist Papers author and first Chief Justice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To ratify the Constitution and establish a unified, stable nation with a strong federal government.</li>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Anti-Federalists</h2>
  <p class="wide">The Anti-Federalists feared a strong central government could become tyrannical, infringing on states’ rights and individual liberties. They advocated for local control and explicit protections for citizens.</p>

  <h3>Core Beliefs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong state governments: More representative of the people.</li>
    <li>Against national taxes: Concern for small farmers and the poor.</li>
    <li>Strict constructionism: Government powers limited to those explicitly granted.</li>
    <li>Protections for liberties: Advocated for a Bill of Rights.</li>
    <li>Fear of a standing army: Could threaten personal freedom.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Figures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Patrick Henry — Opposed Constitution, feared monarchy-like rule.</li>
    <li>George Mason — Refused to sign Constitution without Bill of Rights.</li>
    <li>Mercy Otis Warren — Criticized Constitution through essays.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To oppose ratification as written, press for a Bill of Rights, and maintain state authority and individual freedoms.</li>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Factions and other Anti-Federalist Groups</h2>
    <p class="wide">Beyond Federalists and Anti-Federalists, several factions influenced debates over the Constitution, based on region, economy, and ideology. Opposition came from small farmers, rural communities, delegates from small states, and supporters of the Articles of Confederation. Their shared concern was that a distant, powerful federal government could threaten liberty and state sovereignty.</p>

<p class="wide">Technically, the Federalists “won” the political argument, but the Anti-Federalists shaped the Constitution’s protections, leaving a lasting legacy. After the ratification of the Constitution, the Federalists and Anti-Federalists evolved in different ways, shaping the first political parties and early U.S. politics.</p>

<section id="long-term-legacy"><h2>Long-Term Legacy of the Debate</h2>

<ul>
<li>Federalists: Laid the foundation for a strong central government and federal institutions, but their party dissolved after 1816.</li>

 <section id="birth-of-partisan-politics">
    <h2>The Birth Partisan Politics</h2>
    <p class="wide">The political transformation began in 1792 when the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans became Political Parties.

      <h3>Federalists — Became a Party Around 1791–1792</h3>

      <p class="wide">The Federalists were not an organized political party during the Constitutional debates (1787–1788). They were simply supporters of ratification. They evolved into the first American political party during Washington’s first term, especially after the emergence of Alexander Hamilton’s financial program.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1791:</strong> Hamilton launches the national bank plan → fierce opposition emerges.</li>
        <li><strong>1791–1792:</strong> Federalist members of Congress begin formally coordinating.</li>
        <li><strong>1792:</strong> Supporters of Hamilton and a strong national government begin calling themselves “Federalists” as a party label.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="wide"><strong>Fully organized by:</strong> The 1792 presidential election (They supported Washington, but the party was internally led by Hamilton.)</p>
    
      <h3>Democratic-Republicans — Became a Party in 1792</h3>

      <p class="wide">The Democratic-Republicans (initially called Republicans or Jeffersonian Republicans) formed specifically as a response to Hamilton and the new Federalist Party.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1791:</strong> Madison and Jefferson begin coordinating opposition to Hamilton’s financial system.</li>
        <li><strong>1791–1792:</strong> They build political networks, newspapers, and local committees.</li>
        <li><strong>1792:</strong> They openly campaign against Federalist candidates → first time a true opposition party exists.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="wide"><strong>Fully organized by:</strong> The 1792 presidential election, running candidates opposed to Hamilton’s faction.</p>

      <h2>Why 1792 Is the Key Turning Point</h2>

      <p class="wide">The United States originally expected <strong>no political parties at all</strong>. George Washington openly despised factionalism and warned against it.</p>

      <p class="wide">However, Hamilton and Jefferson developed powerful rival political machines, driven by deeply different visions for the nation.</p>

      <p class="wide">By 1792, newspapers, election committees, and congressional voting blocs were fully aligned which is the defining characteristic of a modern political party.</p>
