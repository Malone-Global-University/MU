      <h2>Federalists — Became a Party Around 1791–1792</h2>

      <p class="wide">The Federalists were not an organized political party during the Constitutional debates (1787–1788). They were simply supporters of ratification. They evolved into the first American political party during Washington’s first term, especially after the emergence of Alexander Hamilton’s financial program.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1791:</strong> Hamilton launches the national bank plan → fierce opposition emerges.</li>
        <li><strong>1791–1792:</strong> Federalist members of Congress begin formally coordinating.</li>
        <li><strong>1792:</strong> Supporters of Hamilton and a strong national government begin calling themselves “Federalists” as a party label.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="wide"><strong>Fully organized by:</strong> The 1792 presidential election (They supported Washington, but the party was internally led by Hamilton.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Democratic-Republicans — Became a Party in 1792</h2>

      <p class="wide">The Democratic-Republicans (initially called Republicans or Jeffersonian Republicans) formed specifically as a response to Hamilton and the new Federalist Party.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1791:</strong> Madison and Jefferson begin coordinating opposition to Hamilton’s financial system.</li>
        <li><strong>1791–1792:</strong> They build political networks, newspapers, and local committees.</li>
        <li><strong>1792:</strong> They openly campaign against Federalist candidates → first time a true opposition party exists.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Fully organized by:</strong> The 1792 presidential election, running candidates opposed to Hamilton’s faction.</p>

      <h2>Why 1792 Is the Key Turning Point</h2>

      <p>The United States originally expected <strong>no political parties at all</strong>. George Washington openly despised factionalism and warned against it.</p>

      <p>However, Hamilton and Jefferson developed powerful rival political machines, driven by deeply different visions for the nation.</p>

      <p>By 1792, newspapers, election committees, and congressional voting blocs were fully aligned — which is the defining characteristic of a modern political party.</p>
