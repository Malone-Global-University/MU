While primarily fueled by economic despair over high taxes and mounting debt, Shays' rebels also had political objections that reflected a deep distrust of distant, centralized power. They believed the Massachusetts state government had grown corrupt and unresponsive to the needs of its citizens, especially those in rural areas. Their grievances revived the rhetoric of the American Revolution, framing their actions not as a rebellion against authority, but as a fight against a new form of tyranny. 

Grievances against the state government
Perceived corruption: The rebels and their supporters believed the government was run by a wealthy, elite faction of merchants and bankers in Boston who enriched themselves at the expense of common farmers. Some critics even accused state officials of cronyism.
Unresponsive legislature: The rebels tried to find relief through peaceful, political means first. Numerous petitions from citizens in western Massachusetts asking for debt relief and paper money were repeatedly rejected or ignored by the legislature.

Disenfranchisement: Many farmers felt marginalized and lacked adequate representation in the state government. They believed the system was unfairly biased against them, which left them feeling politically powerless. 
Objections to the judicial system
Foreclosures and imprisonment for debt: The state's aggressive debt collection laws led to the imprisonment of many farmers and the seizure of their lands and livestock. The rebels saw this as an unjust and oppressive system that favored creditors and punished the impoverished.
High court and lawyer fees: The legal process was expensive, and ordinary farmers often could not afford the high fees associated with court and legal representation. This effectively locked them out of seeking justice through the official channels.

Protesting the courts: As a result of these injustices, a central strategy of the rebellion was to physically shut down county courthouses to prevent trials, foreclosures, and imprisonment for debt. The rebels saw this as the only remaining way to stop the legal system that they believed was oppressing them. 
Echoes of the American Revolution

Resentment of taxes: Having just fought a war against British taxation, the rebels were infuriated by the new state taxes levied to pay off war debts. They saw the state's actions as hypocritical, using the same oppressive tactics they had fought against just a decade earlier.
Belief in the "spirit of resistance": The rebels drew on the revolutionary ideal of resisting what they saw as tyrannical government overreach. Some believed they were obligated to disrupt government in response to injustice, and their actions prompted a debate over whether the "tyranny of the mob" was preferable to a more centralized government. 

Impact on the Constitutional Convention
The political and judicial grievances of the rebels, along with their economic hardships, demonstrated the fragility of the new nation under the Articles of Confederation. To many elites, Shays' Rebellion was proof that a stronger federal government was needed to maintain order and prevent similar uprisings in the future. This fear became a powerful motivating factor for the delegates who convened to draft the U.S. Constitution.
