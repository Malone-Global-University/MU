      <h2>Historical Background</h2>
      <p>After the American Revolution, the federal government faced significant war debt. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton proposed a federal excise tax on distilled spirits in 1791 to raise revenue. Western Pennsylvania farmers, who relied on distilling surplus grain into whiskey as a form of currency, opposed the tax as economically unfair. Frontier communities were geographically and politically disconnected from eastern elites, challenging the new federal government's ability to enforce its laws.</p>

    <section id="major-issues">
      <h2>Major Issues and Grievances</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Taxation and Economic Justice:</strong> Frontier farmers resisted the excise tax that threatened their livelihoods and barter economy.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Authority vs. Local Autonomy:</strong> The rebellion tested the power of the new Constitution to enforce law in remote regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and Political Legitimacy:</strong> Protesters viewed the tax as an infringement on customary practices, leading to harassment and intimidation of federal officials.</li>
        <li><strong>Liberty vs. Order:</strong> Tensions arose between defending revolutionary ideals of liberty and maintaining public order under federal law.</li>
      </ul>
