    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Whiskey Rebellion (1791–1794) was an insurrection prompted by the federal excise tax on distilled spirits, championed by Alexander Hamilton. The tax disproportionately affected small-scale distillers and grain farmers in western Pennsylvania, for whom whiskey was a medium of exchange and an economic staple. Resistance escalated from petitions and intimidation of tax collectors to violent confrontations that culminated in President George Washington leading a large federalized militia to enforce federal law.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hamilton’s fiscal program:</strong> The excise tax was part of a plan to retire national debt and establish federal credit.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontier economy:</strong> Whiskey functioned as cash and transportable value—taxing it hit livelihoods directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Perception of unfairness:</strong> Small producers paid a higher effective rate than large eastern distillers; enforcement seemed biased.</li>
        <li><strong>Legacy of distrust:</strong> Frontier communities distrusted distant federal authorities and feared centralized overreach.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="keyfigures">
      <h2>Key Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alexander Hamilton:</strong> Secretary of the Treasury; architect of the excise tax.</li>
        <li><strong>George Washington:</strong> President; led the federal response to demonstrate enforcement of federal law.</li>
        <li><strong>John Neville:</strong> Federal tax inspector whose property was attacked; a symbol of federal authority.</li>
        <li><strong>David Bradford:</strong> Local leader and lawyer who played a prominent role in organizing resistance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="resistance">
      <h2>Resistance: Tactics and Organization</h2>
      <p>Resistance included petitions, refusal to register stills, intimidation of tax assessors, and occasional mob violence. Groups used local networks and tavern meetings to organize. Early on, resistance aimed to delay or repeal the tax; violence increased after aggressive enforcement actions by federal agents.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="government">
      <h2>Federal Response</h2>
      <p>Washington, aided by Hamilton, decided to assert federal authority. Under the Militia Act of 1792 he called out militias from several states. The show of overwhelming force—around 13,000 strong—was intended to avoid a protracted civil war and to signal that the federal government could uphold law and order.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="collapse">
      <h2>Collapse & Legal Aftermath</h2>
      <p>Most organized resistance disintegrated when federal troops advanced. About 150 men were arrested; only two were convicted of treason. Washington pardoned both—not as leniency towards lawbreaking, but to avoid martyring dissidents. The enforcement campaign, expensive and controversial, established the federal government’s right to levy and collect taxes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="repeal">
      <h2>Political Aftermath & Repeal</h2>
      <p>The excise remained politically unpopular. With the election of Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans, the federal government gradually moved away from Hamilton’s fiscal program; the whiskey tax was effectively repealed in 1802.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="constitutional-issues" class="py-12 px-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Constitutional Issues and Federal Power</h2>
    <p>The Whiskey Rebellion was an early constitutional test under the new federal system. It raised questions about First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights, as well as the limits of protest versus insurrection.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">First Amendment: Assembly and Petition</h3>
    <p>Farmers initially organized peaceful meetings and petitions protesting the whiskey excise tax—actions protected by the First Amendment. But violence—including attacking tax collectors—pushed the conflict beyond protected speech. Federalists viewed organized resistance as defiance of lawful authority, while Jeffersonians saw legitimate dissent taken too far only because the government refused to listen.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Fifth & Sixth Amendments: Due Process and Fair Trials</h3>
    <p>Federal law required suspected tax evaders to be tried in Philadelphia, hundreds of miles away. This burden was severe for poor frontier farmers and resembled earlier Shays-era injustices. After the uprising, about 150 men were arrested for treason, but Washington ultimately pardoned the two who were convicted, reinforcing that due process must remain intact even in crises.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Fourth Amendment: Searches and Seizures</h3>
    <p>Federal excise officers legally obtained warrants, but frontier farmers associated such searches with hated British writs of assistance. Inspections of distilleries—often inside people’s homes—revived colonial fears of arbitrary government intrusion.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Federal Authority and the Constitution</h3>
    <p>President Washington’s decision to mobilize 13,000 militia troops—personally reviewing their march—demonstrated the new federal government's ability to enforce its laws. This stood in stark contrast to the Articles of Confederation era, when the federal government failed to stop Shays’ Rebellion.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Political Impact</h3>
    <p>The response polarized the nation. Federalists argued the crackdown was necessary to preserve order. Democratic-Republicans called it an overreaction that threatened liberty. The event accelerated the formation of America’s first party system.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Hamilton vs. Jefferson</h3>
    <p><strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong> believed the rebellion was a direct challenge to federal sovereignty. Because the whiskey tax underpinned his financial plan, suppressing resistance was essential. He urged Washington to act decisively, fearing that any hesitation would invite anarchy.</p>
    <p><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong> viewed the farmers’ grievances as legitimate and believed the government’s military response was dangerously authoritarian. He argued the tax unfairly targeted small western farmers and pledged to repeal it—which he did in 1802.</p>

    <p>These opposite reactions solidified the ideological divide between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans, shaping American politics for decades.</p>
  </section>

    <section id="significance">
      <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Demonstrated federal enforcement power under the Constitution.</li>
        <li>Highlighted the deep cultural, economic, and political divides between frontier and coastal elites.</li>
        <li>Exposed tensions between Hamiltonian centralization and Jeffersonian republicanism.</li>
        <li>Set precedents for federal intervention in domestic unrest.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="compare">
      <h2>Compare: Whiskey Rebellion & Shays’s Rebellion</h2>
      <p>Both rebellions stemmed from economic distress and resistance to perceived unfair taxation, but they had key differences: Shays’s Rebellion (1786–87) occurred under the Articles of Confederation and highlighted the weakness of the national government; the Whiskey Rebellion (1791–94) occurred under the Constitution and tested its ability to enforce federal law. The federal reaction to the Whiskey Rebellion—large-scale militia mobilization—demonstrated a new level of centralized authority that critics feared might mirror the monarchical power they once fought.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="primary">
      <h2>Primary Sources & Further Reading</h2>
      <p>Key primary materials include letters of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, contemporary newspaper accounts from western Pennsylvania, court records from trials of arrested men, and correspondence of local leaders like David Bradford. For further reading, consult standard scholarly works on early federal fiscal policy and frontier resistance.</p>
