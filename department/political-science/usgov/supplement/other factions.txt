Yes — while the main debate was between Federalists and Anti-Federalists, there were other factions, groups, and ideological divisions during the founding period. Here’s a breakdown:

1. Pro-Constitution Regional Groups

Large-state supporters: Favored proportional representation in Congress (House of Representatives). Mainly delegates from Virginia, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts.

Small-state supporters: Wanted equal representation for each state (Senate). Delegates from New Jersey, Delaware, and other smaller states opposed anything that would dilute their influence.

2. Economic Interest Groups

Merchants and financiers: Favored a strong federal government to regulate trade, establish a national bank, and ensure repayment of war debts. Often aligned with Federalists.

Small farmers and rural populations: Feared federal taxation and centralized authority; typically aligned with Anti-Federalists.

Southern plantation owners: Had mixed positions — generally wanted strong states’ rights to protect slavery and agriculture, but some also saw benefits in federal trade regulation.

3. Revolutionary War Veterans

Some veterans feared a strong central government could replicate the tyranny they had just fought against. Their concerns often overlapped with Anti-Federalists, but some supported Federalist proposals for stability and debt repayment.

4. Ideological or Philosophical Factions

Strict constructionists: Believed the federal government should exercise only powers explicitly written in the Constitution (mostly Anti-Federalist leaning).

Loose constructionists: Believed the federal government could use implied powers to meet national needs (Federalist leaning).

Republican-democrats (proto-Democratic-Republicans): Emerging faction in the 1790s around Jefferson and Madison, favoring agrarianism, states’ rights, and limited federal power.

5. Special Interest or Issue-Based Groups

Backcountry opposition groups: Areas affected by Shays’ Rebellion and similar uprisings resisted strong federal authority.

Urban elites vs. rural communities: Often at odds over taxation, commerce, and representation.

In short, the political landscape was more nuanced than a simple Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist binary. Many smaller factions formed along regional, economic, and philosophical lines, and their interactions influenced compromises in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the early formation of parties.

If you want, I can make a visual chart or table showing all factions and their beliefs, leaders, and influence, which could be added to your Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists page to make it much clearer for students.
