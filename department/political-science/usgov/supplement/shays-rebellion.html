    <h2>What Was Shays’ Rebellion?</h2>
    <p>
      Shays’ Rebellion was an armed uprising in western Massachusetts led largely by indebted farmers—
      many of them veterans of the American Revolution. They faced heavy taxes, aggressive debt collection,
      and mass foreclosures. With the national government powerless under the Articles of Confederation,
      the farmers organized to shut down courts and prevent property seizures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebellion was named after <strong>Daniel Shays</strong>, a former Continental Army captain
      who emerged as one of the movement’s most visible leaders.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1786: Farmers begin preventing local courts from meeting to stop foreclosure orders.</li>
      <li>Early 1787: Rebels attempt to seize the federal arsenal at Springfield, Massachusetts.</li>
      <li>The attempt fails when militia forces fire on the advancing group, ending the uprising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Was It Important?</h2>

    <h3>1. It Exposed the Weakness of the Articles of Confederation</h3>
    <p>
      The national government had no executive branch, no power to raise troops, and no authority
      to regulate the economy. The rebellion made clear that the country lacked the stability needed
      to protect property, maintain order, or support struggling states.
    </p>

    <h3>2. It Sparked Calls for a Stronger National Government</h3>
    <p>
      Leaders such as George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton used Shays’s Rebellion
      as evidence that a new framework of government was urgently needed. The crisis helped convince
      hesitant states to participate in the Constitutional Convention.
    </p>

    <h3>3. It Directly Influenced the U.S. Constitution</h3>
    <p>
      Many provisions of the Constitution—federal authority over commerce, the power to raise armies, and
      the creation of a stronger executive—were shaped in response to the instability highlighted by the rebellion.
    </p>

    <h3>4. It Revealed Early Class Tensions</h3>
    <p>
      The uprising underscored the divide between rural debtor farmers and urban merchant elites.
      The promise of the Revolution felt unfulfilled for many veterans, and Shays’s Rebellion brought
      those tensions into the national spotlight.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>In one sentence:</strong>  
      Shays’s Rebellion showed that the Articles of Confederation were too weak to govern the new nation
      and helped drive the creation of the U.S. Constitution.
    </blockquote>
