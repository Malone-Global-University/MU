Timeline ‚Äî Black communities burned, destroyed, or expelled by white mobs (best-effort, not exhaustive)

Below is a chronological, sourced timeline of major incidents in which Black towns, neighborhoods, or communities in the United States were attacked, burned, or effectively destroyed by white mobs or organized white violence. This is a focused, short timeline of widely documented cases (there are many more local incidents‚Äîespecially during the late 19th and early 20th centuries‚Äîso this is a representative, research-ready starting list, not a complete catalog).

November 10, 1898 ‚Äî Wilmington, North Carolina
A white supremacist mob overthrew Wilmington‚Äôs elected, multiracial city government, killed dozens of Black residents, and burned or drove out Black-owned businesses and the offices of the Black newspaper The Daily Record. The event is remembered as a violent coup that removed Wilmington‚Äôs Black civic and economic leadership. 
Encyclopedia Britannica

July 29‚Äì30, 1910 ‚Äî Slocum area (near Palestine), Texas
White mobs attacked Black residents in the rural Slocum area. Reports describe dozens killed and homes burned; survivors were driven away and the Black community was effectively dispersed. (This massacre is less well known but documented in state historical records and Black history archives.)

1912 (throughout the year) ‚Äî Forsyth County, Georgia (racial expulsion)
Following mob violence and lynchings in 1912, most of Forsyth County‚Äôs Black residents were terrorized into fleeing; they abandoned homes, churches and property and were not allowed to return for decades. While not a single ‚Äúburning‚Äù event, this episode resulted in the eradication of an established Black community.

1919 (Red Summer) ‚Äî Multiple cities and towns (nationwide)
A wave of white-on-Black violence across many cities and rural counties during the ‚ÄúRed Summer‚Äù of 1919 saw Black neighborhoods attacked, homes and businesses burned, and scores to hundreds killed in different places (for example, Washington D.C., Chicago, Elaine/Phillips County in Arkansas, and others). Many Black communities were damaged or destroyed during this period.

Late September‚ÄìOctober 1919 ‚Äî Elaine (Phillips County), Arkansas
Following tensions over Black tenant farmers‚Äô efforts to organize, a white posse and mobs attacked Black sharecroppers near Elaine; estimates of deaths vary widely, and Black communities and their economic bases were destroyed or forcibly dispersed. The Elaine violence is one of the deadliest racial massacres in U.S. history. 
Encyclopedia of Arkansas

November 2, 1920 ‚Äî Ocoee, Florida
On Election Day 1920 a white mob attacked Black residents near Ocoee after a Black man attempted to vote. Estimates vary but dozens were killed, Black homes/places of business were burned, and the Black community was effectively expunged; Ocoee became an all-white town for decades afterward.

May 31 ‚Äì June 1, 1921 ‚Äî Greenwood (Tulsa), Oklahoma ‚Äî ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street‚Äù / Tulsa Race Massacre
A white mob (with documented participation by armed civilians and some law enforcement) attacked Tulsa‚Äôs prosperous Greenwood District, burning large sections of the neighborhood, destroying over a thousand homes and businesses, killing many residents, and leaving thousands homeless. The Greenwood district‚Äîone of the most prominent Black economic centers in the U.S.‚Äîwas devastated. (Extensively documented by archival photos, commission reports, and recent federal reviews.)

January 1923 ‚Äî Rosewood, Florida
A white mob attacked Rosewood, a predominantly Black town in Florida; most Black residents were killed or forced to flee and virtually every building in the town was burned to the ground. Rosewood was never re-established as a Black town afterward. 
Encyclopedia Britannica

Important notes & context

The incidents above are representative, high-profile examples. There were many other attacks (lynchings followed by arson, forced expulsions, and racially motivated property destruction) across the U.S., especially during the late 1800s through the 1930s. Local archival sources, state historical societies, and specialized compilations (e.g., lists of race riots, the ‚ÄúRed Summer‚Äù documentation, state encyclopedias) document dozens more localized instances.

Terminology: historians use varied terms‚Äî‚Äúmassacre,‚Äù ‚Äúrace riot,‚Äù ‚Äúinsurrection,‚Äù ‚Äúexpulsion,‚Äù and ‚Äúcoup.‚Äù Many events were organized, coordinated attacks by white mobs or whites in power rather than spontaneous ‚Äúriots.‚Äù Recent scholarship and official reports have recharacterized several of these events (e.g., Tulsa) as planned attacks.

Completeness: compiling every Black town destroyed by white mobs would require combing state and local records, newspapers, Black press archives, county deeds, and oral histories. This list provides the most widely documented and frequently cited cases and points you toward primary secondary sources.
