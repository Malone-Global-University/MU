  <span>Alexander Chisholm versus The State of Georgia</span>
</nav>


<main>
	<section>
		<h2>The Initial Conflict</h2>

<p class="wide">
On Oct, 31st 1777 the Executive Council of Georgia Agreed to allow Georiga State Govenrment to buy clothing, cotton, and blankets from Robert Farquhar, a resident of South Carolina. These supplies were used to field soldiers stationed in Savannah durung the War of Independence. Georgia took the supplies on consignment as all it's money was spent on wartime expenses. The total bill was $169,613.33 which was to be paid after the war of Independence with Great Britain.</p>


<p class="wide">
The war ended in 1783 but Farquhar died in 1784 unpaid. Soon thereafter a man named Alexander Chisholm Bought Farqahars estate which entitled him to the money Georgia owed to it. After not being compensated for the money owed the estate Chisholm sought repayment 1789 to which Georgia denied his claim.

	<h2>First Lawsuit Hearing</h2>
<p class="wide">
In October 1791 Chisholm sued for his money in the U.S Circuit Court for the District of Georgia.
Georgia Govenor Edward Telfair argued state sovereignty thus the federal court had no jursidiction to bring lawsuits on behalf of out of state claimants. Telfair argued State Sovereignty stating:</p>


<p class="wide">
<em><strong>"...a free, sovereign and independent State... cannot be drawn or compelled... to answer, against the will of the said State of Georgia, before any Justices of the federal Circuit Court for the District of Georgia or before any Justices of any Court of Law or Equity whatsoever".</strong></em><sup>[1]</sup></p>


<p class="wide">
The two circuit judges, Nathaniel Pendelton and James Iredell (also a Supreme court Justice), 
both agreed they lacked jurisdiction based on Judiciary act of 1789. Iredell however goes on to say:</p>


<p class="wide">
	<em><strong> "The constituiton... seems to provide, that in the cases where a state is a party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction..."</strong></em></p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Second & Third Lawsuit Hearings</h2>
	<p class="wide">
On August 1792 the Supreme Court was set to hear the case but Georgia refused show up. Nobody came to represent them at the hearing. Chisholm's lawyer was also Attorney General and Founding Father Edmund Randolph, who decided to give Georgia a second chance to show up. The case was delayed until February 18, 1793</p>



<p class="wide"> February arrived, Georgia delegates failed to appear, and the lawsuit proceeded wihtout them.
Even though they failed to appear Georgia representatives sent letter saying they were immune under sovereignty. In essence they were claiming King status and above the law, that law, corporations, and the ability to enagage in commerce itself existed only because of them.</p>

<p class="wide">This raised two important questions:</p>


<ol>
<li>Can a citizen sue a state in federal court?</li>
<li>Does the constitution give power to federal courts to hear dases involving citizens and states?</li>
</ol>


<p class="wide">
This was decided with an overwhelmimg yes on February 18, 1793 where the Supreme Court sided 4-1 in favor of Chisholm, Iredell being the only dissenter. Justices who heard the case were:</p>


<ul class="none">
<li>James Iredell</li>
<li>Cushing</li>
<li>Blair</li>
<li>James Wilson (mocked state sovereignty)</li>
<li>John Jay (state sovereignty does not exists)</li>
</ul>

<p class="wide">
John Jay, of Declaration of Independence and Jay Treay of 1794 Fame, went further than Wilson saying:</p>


<p class="wide"><strong><em>"Sovereignty is the right to govern... here it rests with the people.")</em></strong>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Court Decision Reversal</h2>
<p class="wide">
The Judges made it clear The Constitution gave power to the Supreme Court hear cases by citizens against States.
However Iredell dissented by basing his argument on British Law from colonial rule, and most States agreed with Iredell for they were afraid of being sued for wartime debt which they had all accrued. This pushabck eventuall leads to the creation of the 11th amendment which forbids citizens or foriegn countries from suing states <em>in federal court</em>. They can however be sued in State courts, but this is controversial since it create the conflict of interest where the State is both defendant and policy maker of the court in which the lawsuit is held leading to critism of lack of accountability. The 11th amendment says to the effect:</p>

<p class="wide"><strong><em>
The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.</em></strong></p>


<p class="wide">
The case of Chisholm v. Georgia is hostorically important because it was the first Supreme Court Case to have any bearing on the Constitution. At the time due to lack of judical structure and concerns there were no pressing Constitutional issues being presented. The 11th amendment blocked the previous Supreme Court Decision. Alexander 
Chishom still fought to recieve his money until he died 1810thout personally recieving a single cent. His son-in-law Peter Trezevant pursed the case until finally in November 1847 the Georgiz legislature passed a bill and paid him. He was 79 years old. It took 53 years after the first hearing for the issue to be settled.

<h2>About Edward Telfair's Role</h2>


<p class="wide">
Edward Telfair's main response to Chisholm v. Georgia was to issue a fiery address to the Georgia General Assembly, claiming the ruling would lead to an "annihilation of [the state's] political existence". He also implemented a resolution, passed by the House but not the Senate, which called for the death penalty for anyone trying to enforce a judgment against the state, according to the Federal Judicial Center. 
</p>

<p class="wide">
Governor's Address: In response to the Supreme Court's decision, Governor Telfair stated that if more suits like Chisholm's were filed against Georgia, it would result in the state's complete political destruction.
</p>

<p class="wide">
Legislative Resolution: The Georgia House of Representatives passed a resolution stating that anyone attempting to enforce a judgment against the state would be subject to the death penalty. However, the state Senate took no action on this resolution.
</p>

<p class="wide">
Role in the Case: The suit itself named Governor Telfair as the party to be served with the legal process. His office, as the executive branch, was the entity that was to receive a copy of the legal summons. 
</p>

<p class="wide">
The case, and the state's reaction under Telfair, ultimately led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment, which overturned the ruling and prohibited citizens of one state from suing another state in federal court. 
</p>

<p class="wide">
Edward Telfair was the Governor of Georgia during the landmark Supreme Court case Chisholm v. Georgia (1793). The lawsuit was brought against the State of Georgia by Alexander Chisholm, executor of the estate of a South Carolina merchant, to recover Revolutionary War debt owed to the merchant by Georgia. 

<p class="wide">
Georgia, under Telfair's governorship, refused to appear in the Supreme Court, asserting that, as a sovereign state, it was immune from being sued by a private citizen. The Court, however, disagreed, ruling 4-1 in favor of Chisholm, stating that the federal judiciary had the authority to hear such cases based on Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which specifies the types of cases the Supreme Court can hear. 
</p>

<p class="wide">
Telfair vocally expressed his opposition to the ruling, stating in an address to the General Assembly that it threatened the political existence of the state. The Georgia House of Representatives even passed a resolution threatening the death penalty for anyone attempting to enforce a judgment against the state, though the state Senate did not act on it. 
</p>

<p class="wide">
The significant opposition from Georgia and other states to the Chisholm v. Georgia decision led to the creation and ratification of the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This amendment limits the power of federal courts to hear lawsuits against states by citizens of other states or foreign countries. The full text of the amendment can be found in the referenced documents. Essentially, the Eleventh Amendment reversed the Supreme Court's ruling in Chisholm v. Georgia, reinforcing the principle of state sovereign immunity.
