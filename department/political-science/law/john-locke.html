        <h2>Biography</h2>
      </header>
      <p>John Locke was born on August 29, 1632, in Wrington, Somerset, England. He studied at Westminster School and later at Christ Church, Oxford. Trained in medicine and natural philosophy, Locke worked as a physician and an adviser to prominent politicians, including the Earl of Shaftesbury. He lived through the English Civil Wars, the Restoration, and the Glorious Revolution — turbulent events that shaped his political thought. Locke died on October 28, 1704.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Two Treatises of Government (1689)</h3>
        <p>Argues against absolute monarchy and for government by consent. Introduces natural rights (life, liberty, property) and the right of revolution against tyranny.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)</h3>
        <p>Develops Locke's theory of mind as a tabula rasa (blank slate) and defends empiricism — the idea that knowledge comes from experience rather than innate ideas.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>A Letter Concerning Toleration (1689)</h3>
        <p>Advocates religious toleration (among Protestants) and limits state interference in individual conscience.</p>
      </section>
    </article>

    <article id="philosophy">
      <header>
        <h2>Core Political Philosophy</h2>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural rights:</strong> Individuals possess rights by virtue of their humanity — primarily life, liberty, and property.</li>
        <li><strong>Social contract:</strong> Government is formed by the consent of the governed to protect those rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited government:</strong> Political authority should be constrained and accountable.</li>
        <li><strong>Right of revolution:</strong> When rulers betray the trust of the people, citizens may overthrow them.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

      <header>
        <h2>Influence and Legacy</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Locke's ideas deeply influenced Enlightenment thinkers across Europe and the founding generation in North America. Thomas Jefferson's phrasing in the Declaration of Independence echoes Locke's language about natural rights. Locke's writings also shaped modern liberal thought, constitutional government, and debates about religious freedom and education.</p>
