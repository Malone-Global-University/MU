      <h1>Hierarchy of Laws in the United States</h1>
      <p>A concise guide to what comes after the U.S. Constitution and how conflicts between laws are resolved.</p>
    </header>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. U.S. Constitution (Highest Law of the Land)</h2>
      <p>The Constitution creates the federal government, allocates powers, and protects individual rights. Any law—federal, state, or local—that conflicts with the Constitution is invalid under the <strong>Supremacy Clause</strong> (Article VI, Clause 2).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Federal Laws (Statutes)</h2>
      <p>Statutes passed by <em>Congress</em>. Examples include civil-rights statutes, federal tax laws, and national regulations that address interstate issues. Federal statutes must conform to the Constitution.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Federal Regulations (Administrative Rules)</h2>
      <p>Regulations created by federal agencies (EPA, FDA, FCC, etc.) under authority delegated by Congress. They carry the force of law but must be based on statutory authority and respect constitutional limits.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Federal Court Decisions (Case Law)</h2>
      <p>Federal courts interpret the Constitution, statutes, and regulations. The U.S. Supreme Court's decisions bind all courts; federal circuit and district court rulings bind within their respective jurisdictions and cases.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. State Constitutions</h2>
      <p>Each state has its own constitution establishing its government and often guaranteeing rights beyond the federal floor. State constitutions cannot conflict with the U.S. Constitution.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. State Statutes</h2>
      <p>Passed by state legislatures, these control areas traditionally left to states: family law, property, most criminal law, education, and local governance. State statutes must comply with both the state and U.S. Constitutions and cannot be preempted by valid federal law.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. State Regulations</h2>
      <p>Rules promulgated by state agencies (licensing, state environmental standards, professional boards). They implement state statutes and must stay within the authority the legislature grants.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. State Court Decisions</h2>
      <p>State courts interpret state constitutions and laws. The state's highest court (often called the Supreme Court) is the final authority on state law, except when a federal constitutional issue exists.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>9. Local Laws (Municipal Ordinances)</h2>
      <p>City and county ordinances address zoning, local safety rules, noise, local taxes, and permits. Local laws must conform to state law and both constitutions; many states limit how far local governments can regulate.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Quick Reference: Simple Hierarchy</h2>
      <ol class="hierarchy">
        <li>U.S. Constitution</li>
        <li>Federal statutes (Congress)</li>
        <li>Federal regulations (agencies)</li>
        <li>Federal court decisions</li>
        <li>State constitutions</li>
        <li>State statutes (state legislatures)</li>
        <li>State regulations (state agencies)</li>
        <li>State court decisions</li>
        <li>Local ordinances (cities/counties)</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When Laws Conflict</h2>
      <p>When two laws clash, the higher law controls. Federal law preempts state law where Congress has acted within its constitutional authority. Constitutional protections override statutes and regulations that would otherwise violate them.</p>
