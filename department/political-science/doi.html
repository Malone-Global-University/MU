<p class="wide">
<strong>1. Introduction (Preamble)</strong>: Explains why the colonies are declaring independence.</p>

<p class="wide">
<em>“When in the Course of human events…”</em>  establishes the philosophy of natural rights and the social contract.</p>

<p class="wide">
<strong>2. Philosophical Foundation (Statement of Beliefs):</strong> Declares universal principles of liberty and equality.</p>

<p class="wide">
<em>“We hold these truths to be self-evident…”</em>  is influenced by Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke.</p>

<p class="wide"><strong>3. List of Grievances:</strong> Specific accusations against King George III</p>

<p class="wide">How he violated the colonists’ rights. Over 25 grievances (e.g., taxation without consent, quartering troops, dissolving legislatures).</p>

<p class="wide"><strong>4. Formal Declaration of Independence:</strong> Announces that the colonies are now “free and independent States.”</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>⚖️ Historical Context</h2>

<p class="wide">Written in June–July 1776 by Thomas Jefferson with editing by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston (the “Committee of Five”).</p>

<p class="wide">Adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. Rooted in Enlightenment thought; particularly natural rights, popular sovereignty, and the right of revolution. Aimed both at Britain and the world, to justify the rebellion.</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>🗣️ Key Themes</h2>

<p class="wide"><strong>Equality and Natural Rights:</strong> “All men are created equal… endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.”</p>

<p class="wide"><strong>Government by Consent:</strong> Legitimate power comes from the consent of the governed.</p>

<p class="wide"><strong>Right to Revolution:</strong> People can overthrow a government that becomes destructive to their rights.</p>

<p class="wide">
<strong>Appeal to Universal Principles:</strong> Not just a colonial complaint but a philosophical claim about human freedom.</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>🌍 Global Impact</h2>
<p class="wide">Inspired revolutions in France, Haiti, Latin America, and other regions.<br>
Continues to shape democratic and human rights movements worldwide.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>📜 The Preamble (Introduction)</h2>

<p class="wide">“When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another…”</p>

<p class="wide">This opening sentence sets the tone, purpose, and justification for the document. It tells the reader why the colonies are writing: not to start a war, but to explain their reasons to the “opinions of mankind.”</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>⚖️ Purpose of the Preamble</h2>
<h3>Legitimizes the Revolution:</h3>

<p class="wide">The colonists aren’t acting out of anger or chaos: they’re following a rational, moral process to separate from Britain.</p>

<p class="wide">They claim independence is necessary when a government violates natural law.</p>

<h3>Appeal to the World:</h3>

<p class="wide">The writers know other nations (especially France) will read this.</p>

<p class="wide">They want international sympathy and possible alliances by showing the revolution is justified, not reckless.</p>

<h3>Sets a Universal Standard:</h3>

<p class="wide">
It says this is not just about Britain and America: it’s about the rights of all people everywhere.</p>

<p class="wide">The phrase “one people” suggests equality between nations as well as individuals.</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>🧠 Philosophical Foundations</h2>


<p class="wide">The preamble reflects Enlightenment philosophy, especially John Locke’s social contract theory:</p>

<ul>
<li>People form governments to protect their natural rights.</li>
<li>When government breaks that contract, the people have a right: even a duty: to abolish it.</li>
<li>That act must be guided by reason and principle, not passion.</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h2>🌍 In Simple Terms</h2>

<p class="wide"> The Preamble says:</p>

<p class="wide">
“We are about to break away from Great Britain, and we know this is serious.
But when a government no longer respects people’s rights, it is both logical and moral to separate.
We’ll now explain to the world why we must do so.”
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>🏛️ Key Phrases to Notice</h2>
<h4>“Course of human events”</h4>

<p class="wide">
Situates their actions in world history: not just local rebellion.
</p>

<h4>“One people… another”</h4>

<p class="wide">Asserts equality between colonies and Britain: two peoples, not master and subjects.</p>

<h4>“Decent respect to the opinions of mankind”</h4>

<p class="wide">Appeals to reason, not violence. The Declaration is a legal and moral argument, not a mere complaint.</p>

<h4>“Declare the causes”</h4>

<p class="wide">Sets up the document’s structure: what follows will be a logical proof.</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>🧩 Why It Matters</h2>

<ul>
<li>It transforms rebellion into revolution: from criminal act to moral act.</li>
<li>It creates a universal moral language for later movements (abolition, women’s suffrage, civil rights).</li>
<li>It teaches that legitimacy comes not from kings or power, but from reason and consent.</li>
</ul>
</section>
