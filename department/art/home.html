      <h2>What Is Art, and What Is Its Purpose?</h2>
      <p class="wide">
    Art is among humanity’s oldest and most mysterious acts. Long before there were nations or written laws, there were paintings on cave walls, songs carried through the air, and dances around firelight. These gestures were not born of necessity but of a deep impulse to express what cannot be said... to make visible the invisible. In this sense, art is both a mirror of the world and a bridge between souls. The soul, as defined here, is the individual’s capacity for independent thought, authentic emotion, and the truth of personal experience. Artists who remain loyal to these inner truths create works that endure. Great art is difficult precisely because it demands honesty; bland overly commercialized art is excessively recycled reductive churn. Once a format is mastered it is easy to plug and play and auto generate content  which is precisely why it lacks creativity. The trade off between high art and commercial art is one transcends human understanding of the world, the other algorithmically computes best practices for mass consensus to derive maximum profit.

  <h2>Mission Statement from the Founder</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    At Malone Global University, we study art through cultural perspectives that emphasize unity through shared humanity rather than division through difference. Our goal is to bridge cultural gaps and rebuild dignity through creative expression. Dissatisfied with current African American representation in media, I have identified several guiding principles.
  </p>

  <p class="wide">
    First, art must promote the beauty and depth of one’s culture rather than exploit stereotypes for profit. Second, while art powerfully stirs emotion, it should not be mistaken for political reasoning. Emotion can inspire, but policy requires structure and critical thought. Third, the history of art is inseparable from the marginalized—people once cast out by dominant societies. Understanding this history helps us see how creative industries evolved within systems of inequality, and how exploitation, sensationalism, and moral compromise have often been used to maintain control. By studying these origins, we learn to reclaim art as a tool of liberation rather than manipulation.
  </p>

  <p class="wide">
    Art should inspire awareness, not blind loyalty. Many movements have used art as a spark for social change, but true revolution demands strategy, organization, and long-term planning. Artists may lead emotionally, but lasting progress requires analytical vision. When art joins with education, economics, and social design, it transforms from entertainment into empowerment.

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Art must promote positive images in negative times.</li>
    <li>Black culture should use art to highlight success, resilience, and creativity rather than reinforce destructive stereotypes.</li>
    <li>Media industries often reward narratives that weaken moral or communal strength; we must challenge those incentives with truth and dignity.</li>
    <li>Rap and hip-hop, though often criticized, remain among the most honest reflections of social reality. Much of the genre rejects crime and glorifies survival, community, and justice. Selective listening and biased criticism distort its meaning.</li>
    <li>America’s obsession with celebrity reveals how culture celebrates moral decay as entertainment. Our mission is to reverse that trend through responsible storytelling.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Goals of the Malone Art Department</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The world watches what we create. Every artistic decision must therefore align with cultural consciousness and the principles of the Malone Doctrine. Validation here is not approval seeking; it arises from honoring your own excellence and integrity. Every song, film, or artwork must strengthen our collective dignity and contribute to the political, economic, and structural advancement of people of African descent worldwide.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Counter propaganda with objective truth.</li>
    <li>Provide authentic representations of African and African American life rather than fabricated caricatures.</li>
    <li>Tell our stories in our own voices.</li>
    <li>Document our pain, joy, hopes, struggles, and victories with honesty.</li>
    <li>Retain ownership and control of the wealth generated by our creativity.</li>
    <li>Build soft power through culture—music, cinema, fashion, and innovation.</li>
    <li>Recognize that African Americans shape global culture and therefore global perception. We are a foundation of modern soft power and moral authority.</li>
  </ul>
