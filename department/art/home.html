    <h2>What Is Art, and What Is Its Purpose?</h2>
    <p class="wide">Art is among humanity’s oldest and most mysterious acts. Long before there were nations or written laws, there were paintings on cave walls, songs carried through the air, and dances around firelight. These gestures were not born of necessity but of a deep impulse to express what cannot be said in an attempt to make visible the invisible. In this sense, art is both a mirror of the world and a bridge between souls. I define soul as what a human has that a sellout has sold: their independent thoughts, emotions, and truth of their personal experience. Sellouts sacrifice these for money and status... many great artists died poor. Great art is hard. Easy art is commercial churn.</p>
  </section>


<section>
  <h2>The Nature of Art</h2>
<p class="wide">
At its core, art is the expression of human creativity and imagination through forms that stir emotion, thought, or reflection. It can take any shape such as painting, music, poetry, architecture, digital design, and still be recognized as art so long as it carries intention and meaning beyond pure function. A chair built only to sit upon is craft; a chair sculpted to evoke power or fragility becomes art.
</p>


<p class="wide">
Art differs from science in method and from religion in certainty. It does not prove; it reveals. Where science seeks to understand the laws of the world, and religion to define its purpose, art explores the human experience that lives between the two.
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p class="wide">
Art allows people to speak across time and language. A melody from a distant culture or a sculpture from a vanished civilization still moves us because art transmits emotion directly. As the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote, art is the “transfer of feeling from one person to another.” It is empathy made visible.
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p class="wide">
Art mirrors life, its joy, suffering, and contradictions. The artist holds up this mirror not merely to copy reality, but to reveal what often goes unseen. In this sense, art becomes a kind of moral and social commentary. When Picasso painted Guernica, he did not simply portray war; he condemned it. When writers like James Baldwin or Chinua Achebe told their stories, they reflected the deeper truths of identity, power, and history.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Transformation</h2>

<p class="wide">
True art changes those who encounter it. It may comfort the afflicted or afflict the comfortable. It can heal, awaken, or disturb. Through this power, art participates in what the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche called “the justification of existence as an aesthetic phenomenon.” By creating beauty and meaning, we redeem the pain of living.
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Preservation</h2>

<p class="wide">
Art is also a vessel of memory. Civilizations rise and fall, but their art remains as evidence that they dreamed. The pyramids of Egypt, the carvings of Benin, the symphonies of Europe, and the murals of Diego Rivera all record what their societies valued most. Art endures when power and wealth decay.
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Creation for Its Own Sake</h2>
<p class="wide">
Not all art must teach, protest, or preserve. Some art exists simply because humans possess a drive to create, to bring something new into being. Immanuel Kant called this “purposiveness without purpose,” meaning that art can be valuable even when it serves no practical end. It exists for the joy of creation itself, for the aesthetic experience of beauty and imagination.
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>The Philosophical Dialogue</h2>

<p class="wide">
Throughout history, thinkers have wrestled with the meaning of art. Plato mistrusted art, believing it to be an imitation of an imitation, a shadow of truth. Aristotle countered that art provides catharsis, purging emotion through imitation. Kant saw art as disinterested beauty, experienced without need for possession or use. Tolstoy viewed art as moral communication between people. Nietzsche saw it as the highest act of life-affirmation whiich is the creative force that redeems existence itself. These perspectives, though different, converge on one insight: art matters because it engages the deepest part of what it means to be human, which I have previosuly stated as our capacity to imagine, to feel, and to create meaning from experience.
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="wide">
Art is not luxury; it is necessity. It is the language of the soul, the memory of civilizations, and the engine of renewal in every age. Whether carved into stone or written in pixels, art gives shape to the invisible, to thought, emotion, and spirit. Its purpose is not fixed, for it evolves with humanity itself. Yet in every form, art remains what it has always been: humanity’s attempt to see itself clearly and to leave behind evidence that we were here, that we felt, and that we dreamed.

  <h2>Mission Statement from Founder</h2>
  <p class="wide">At Malone Global University we study art from cultural points of view. We emphasis what unites us through similarities rather than what divides us. This helps bridge cultural gaps. Dissatified with current African American representation in media I personally have noted a few things. The first is that art should be used to promote the beauty of your culture; not make money in a sleazy way by appealing to the lowest common denominator using exploitiative steoretypes that encourage misrepresentation of an entire race. The second is that art focuses on emotion and is not a substitute for true political discourse and reasoning as art appeals to emotion not logic. Thirdly entertainment was originally associated with the criminal class; from the court jester, to the starving artists of the renaisannce who resorted to prostitution and sleeping with merchants obese wives for pay while lying and telling them that "fat was beautiful" or "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" to scam them, to vaudeville, to carnival freaks, to all ages of music, to scandalous literature, to contemporary cinema actors, to modern day content creators. All these artforms were heavily dictated by freaks, criminals, and other social outcasts such as homosexuals. This is not to cast artists in a negative light. This is to document historical origins that are necessary for understanding modern society.</p>


<p class="wide">
   This creates an environment that breeds cult-like worship from people who use emotion to lie to gather sympathy to pay their bills. While many social movements have been started by art revolutions this is a romanticized notion. True revolution comes from people who understand what problems exist in society and what the solution should be. Artists are influenced more by raw feelings than objective truth. They are not good at analysis. So while they may feel strongly about a subject and be talented to bring people to their cause, they are usually not successful in leadership and creating long term social change. Understanding the role of art as "entertainment only" prevents people from mistaking art as the work of politics itself. While artists are free to bring attention to causes they themselves should not be the leaders unless they diviate far from art as a style and focus on social engineering as a science. This is rare for an artist achieve because it reflects completely different modes of operation and process. Art explores how and why we feel not necessarily what policy should be and how to best execute it.</p>

  <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Art needs to promote Positve Images in Negative Times.</li>
    <li>Black Culture needs to use art as a medium to Promote positive stories and images of success rather that crime culture.</li>
    <li>Hollywood is a very homosexual-centric place that emasculates black men as a form of control. This causes contention.</li>
    <li>Rap stars and movie stars ain't nothing but hoes. Rapper 'Tha Realest said this. He had a point.</li>
    <li>You cannot blame everything on rap. Crime existed before 1970s-1980s and early rap started in the park not prison</li>
    <li>People who say rap causes moral decay are cherry picking. In truth they never listened to rap music in its entirety.<br>
     The majority of rap music is positive and constantly rejects criminal activity it is accused of promoting.<br>
     This is especially true in "Gangsta Rap". Gangsta rap is often accused of promoting things it directly argues against.<br>
     Only racists and coons say otherwise. Until Blacks play Hollywood politics better I will be starting Independent Studios To push Malone Doctrine themed stories.</li>
    <li>Jews use stereotypes in movies because they know no other methods of creating cinema. This is harmful to blacks and opportunistic. Jews have admitted this. This does not meet my standards for Black Excellence.</li>
    <li>America celebrates criminals. The word "celebrity" means who we celebrate. Therefore violence, drugs, ans sex sells, despite appearing criminal. </li>
    <li>Starving artists historically turned to prostitution. This continues in Hollywood and fashion. I think people should understand the historical outcomes become signing up to be an artist.</li>
    <li>Women knew Hollywood was "sleeping your way to the top" but cried #metoo when caught. Society conditions this response.</li>
    <li>If you didn't know, now you do so if you work in sleazy industries you cannot say you are innocent and naive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Goals of Malone Art departments</h2>
  <p class="wide">
    The whole world watches what we do. Therefore we must have a plan. Part of Malone Doctrine is to exhibit cultural conscousness in every decision we make. This is especially true when it comes to art. This is how we will be seen, judged, quoted, respected, and validated.<br>
     Here "validation" does not mean asking for acceptance but testament to being revered by the masses. Every song, movie scene, or artwork must carry pride and dignify ourselves as a race.<br>
     Ideally it should check off as many boxes as possible for advancing the political, economic, and structual stability of African Americans at home and extend to all Africans abroad.</p>  

  <ul>
    <li>Counter Propagnda with objective truth.</li>
    <li>Provide truthful representation of African American lifestyles, not stereotypical roles created to enslave a nation.</li>
    <li>Tell our stories in our voice.</li>
    <li>Make clear who we are as a people, our pain, joy, hopes, struggles, and most importantly our victories.</li>
    <li>Control wealth we create from our work.</li>
    <li>Build soft power through culture: music, movies, fashion, and anything else that is "cool".</li>
    <li>Remind racists that through this soft power African Americans are respected and they are not despite them saying "everyone hates us". If that were true they would not fund us, support us, and imitate us.</li>    
    <li>Remind ourselves that our strongest soft power is moral currency African Americans hold as being the descendants of slaves and torch bearers of civil rights and our second strongest is as trend setters and entertainers.<br>
     American entertainment is exported globally. Between America foreign diplomacy as as balance of soft and hard power, much of that is really backed by African American contributions.<br>
     We contribute to everything in no small or theoretical measure but direct quantifiable metrics.</li>
       </ul>
