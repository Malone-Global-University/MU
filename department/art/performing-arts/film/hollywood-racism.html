<h2>The Cost of Fame</h2>
<p class="wide"> 
Hollywood calls itself the dream factory, but every factory has a cost.
From its earliest days, American cinema has reflected the country’s deepest contradictions with its belief in freedom alongside its obsession with hierarchy. The film industry created a mythic version of America: noble heroes, beautiful women, and moral triumphs. Yet for much of its history, Black and brown people were excluded from that dream or trapped in roles that made them seem less than human.</p>

<p class="wide">
This contradiction remains central to understanding Hollywood. It is not only a story of art and profit, but of who gets to define what “normal” looks like.</p>
</section>


<section id="hollywood-racism">
<h2>I. Early Hollywood: The Roots of Exclusion</h2>

<p class="wide">
The first moving pictures were made in an America still haunted by slavery and segregation. Early filmmakers did not invent racism, but they learned to market it. D. W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation (1915) pioneered cinematic technique while glorifying the Ku Klux Klan. That film, screened in the White House, cemented Hollywood’s pattern: technical brilliance joined to racial blindness.</p>

<p class="wide">
Most of the major studios were founded by first-generation immigrants (often Jewish, Irish, or Eastern European) who had escaped discrimination in Europe. To gain legitimacy in a Protestant-dominated America, they built stories that celebrated white respectability and middle-class ideals. In doing so, they often erased Black life or used it as a contrast to “proper” American identity. Assimilation came at the price of perpetuating exclusion.</p>

<p class="wide">
Black performers survived on the margins: Stepin Fetchit’s clownish persona or Hattie McDaniel’s maid in Gone With the Wind (1939) were among the few roles available. Each was forced to perform a stereotype to remain employable.</p>

<section id="hollywood-racism">
<h2>II. The Code Era: Morality and Representation</h2>

<p class="wide">
From the 1930s to the 1950s, the Hays Code dictated what could and could not appear on screen. Officially, it protected public morals; in practice, it preserved a racial order. Black–white romance was banned, homosexuality was hidden, and interracial conflict was softened.</p>


<p class="wide">
White women were idealized as pure, while women of color were cast as dangerous or hypersexual. The “mammy,” the “jezebel,” and the “noble savage” became recurring stock characters. The system taught audiences not just what to watch, but what to believe.</p>

<p class="wide">
Still, resistance persisted. Musicians and actors used coded language, double meanings, and humor to sneak dignity into limited spaces. Jazz films, all-Black musicals, and race movies produced by independent Black studios offered glimpses of another America — one that the mainstream refused to see.</p>
</section>


<section id="hollywood-racism">
<h2>III. Postwar Shifts: Respectability and Rebellion</h2>

<p class="wide">
After World War II, global decolonization and domestic civil-rights struggles forced Hollywood to confront its image. Studios began showcasing “model minorities” to appear progressive without surrendering control.</p>

<p class="wide">
Sidney Poitier embodied this balancing act. In films like Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967), he represented intelligence, restraint, and moral superiority — yet always within boundaries set by white writers. He was a hero who could be admired but not emulated too loudly.</p>


<p class="wide">
The 1970s changed that. Independent filmmakers and a new generation of Black audiences demanded something rawer. Shaft, Super Fly, and Foxy Brown turned anger into spectacle. These Blaxploitation films gave Black actors leading roles and cultural power, but the profits flowed upward to mostly white financiers. The line between representation and exploitation blurred.</p>
</section>


<section id="hollywood-racism">
<h2>IV. Modern Hollywood: Progress and Persistence</h2>

<p class="wide">
From the 1980s through the early 2000s, diversity became a marketing slogan. Major studios began producing “issue films” that centered race but reassured white audiences. Driving Miss Daisy, The Blind Side, and The Help followed the same pattern: white moral awakening through proximity to Black suffering.</p>

<p class="wide">
Meanwhile, real progress grew elsewhere in independent film and television. Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing (1989) exposed America’s racial tension without comforting anyone. Ava DuVernay’s Selma (2014) and Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther (2018) pushed representation further, combining art and political consciousness. These directors controlled both narrative and aesthetics, reshaping who could tell the story of America.</p>

<p class="wide">
Yet structural inequality persists. Behind the camera, ownership remains concentrated. Black talent often faces pressure to conform to commercial formulas. Colorism influences casting, and Black women directors still struggle for funding. Hollywood’s racism has become more polished, but not fully dismantled.</p>

<h2>V. Power, Profit, and Accountability</h2>

<p class="wide">
Racism in Hollywood endures not only through prejudice but through economics. Stereotypes sell because they are familiar, cheap to reproduce, and profitable worldwide. Violence and humiliation become entertainment, while genuine cultural expression is labeled “niche.”</p>

<p class="wide">
Every industry follows its incentives. But art also carries moral responsibility. Whether a producer is Black, white, Jewish, Asian, or Latino, the same question applies: does this work liberate or dehumanize? Does it tell the truth, or recycle fear for profit?</p>

<p class="wide">
Calling out racism is not about punishing individuals; it is about exposing systems. The men and women who built Hollywood were shaped by their own struggles for survival. Understanding that context allows critique without hatred. The task now is not to erase the past, but to create new power structures that reward honesty and equity.</p>
</section>

<section id="hollywood-racism">
<h2>VI. Conclusion – Art, Ethics, and Ownership</h2>

<p class="wide">
Hollywood’s story is America’s story as a mixture of brilliance and blindness, progress and hypocrisy. For over a century, film has both reflected and reinforced social hierarchy. But it has also carried the tools to undo it: empathy, imagination, and the ability to see ourselves in others.</p>

<p class="wide">
True reform begins when creators control their narratives. That means Black filmmakers owning studios, writers’ rooms reflecting real diversity, and audiences demanding more than token gestures. Representation alone is not liberation; ownership is.</p>

<p class="wide">
Under the Malone Doctrine, art becomes an instrument of dignity and reconstruction. The goal is not simply to show Black faces on screen, but to ensure those faces speak their own truth as complex, proud, and unapologetically human. Hollywood once built myths to exclude us. The next generation must build realities that include everyone.</p>
