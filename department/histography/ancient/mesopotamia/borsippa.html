  <h1>Borsippa (c. 2000–539 BCE)</h1>
  <p>A major Mesopotamian city, Borsippa was a religious and cultural hub closely tied to Babylon, renowned for its Ezida temple and ziggurat dedicated to the god Nabu.</p>
</section>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Borsippa arose during the early second millennium BCE as a Sumerian settlement. Its proximity to Babylon allowed it to flourish as a religious center and maintain cultural significance through the Old Babylonian and Neo-Babylonian periods.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Borsippa became synonymous with religious devotion and temple construction. Its Ezida temple, dedicated to Nabu (god of wisdom and writing), was a focal point for priests, scribes, and pilgrims. The city also benefited economically from its position near Babylon and the Euphrates trade routes.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High priests of Nabu, who oversaw temple rituals, administration, and education.</li>
      <li>Local governors responsible for maintaining order and collecting tribute.</li>
      <li>Babylonian kings who sponsored temple renovations and festivals in Borsippa.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Repeated rebuilding of the Ezida ziggurat after damage from floods or invasions.</li>
      <li>Integration into Babylonian hegemony under Hammurabi and later kings.</li>
      <li>Participation in religious festivals attracting visitors from across Mesopotamia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>The primary deity was <strong>Nabu</strong>, god of wisdom, writing, and divination. Borsippa’s temples also honored Marduk and other Mesopotamian gods, reinforcing the city’s religious prestige.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>Borsippa declined after the Persian conquest in 539 BCE. While it retained religious importance for some time, political and economic significance diminished, and the city gradually disappeared from historical records. Archaeological remains of the ziggurat and temple foundations testify to its former prominence.</p>
