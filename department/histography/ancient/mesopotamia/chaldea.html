  <h1>The Neo-Babylonian Empire (626–539 BCE)</h1>
  <p>The last great Mesopotamian dynasty, the Neo-Babylonian Empire—often called the Chaldean Empire—rose from the ashes of Assyria and shone brightly before succumbing to Persia.</p>
</section>

<main>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Neo-Babylonian Empire was born from revolt. As Assyria weakened in the late 7th century BCE, <strong>Nabopolassar</strong>, a Chaldean tribal leader from southern Mesopotamia, seized Babylon in 626 BCE. He allied with the Medes and Scythians to bring down the Assyrian colossus.</p>
    <p>This revival of Babylonian independence was celebrated as a restoration of Mesopotamia’s cultural heartland after centuries of foreign domination.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Zenith</h2>
    <p>Under Nabopolassar’s son <strong>Nebuchadnezzar II</strong>, Babylon entered a golden age. He expanded the empire from the Persian Gulf to the Levant, defeating Egypt and crushing Judah. His reign (605–562 BCE) is remembered for military might, monumental architecture, and cultural revival.</p>
    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nabopolassar</strong> — Founder of the dynasty; led the final destruction of Assyria (612–609 BCE).</li>
      <li><strong>Nebuchadnezzar II</strong> — Greatest king; expanded empire, conquered Jerusalem, and built Babylon’s wonders.</li>
      <li><strong>Nabonidus</strong> — The last king, controversial for his devotion to the moon god Sin and neglect of Marduk’s cult.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Battles and Campaigns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Battle of Carchemish (605 BCE)</strong> — Nebuchadnezzar crushed the Egyptians and remnants of Assyria, securing dominance over the Near East.</li>
      <li><strong>Siege of Jerusalem (597 & 587 BCE)</strong> — Judah’s capital was destroyed, and elites were deported in the famous “Babylonian Captivity.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Culture</h3>
    <p>The Babylonians exalted <strong>Marduk</strong>, god of order and patron of Babylon, especially during the New Year festival (<em>Akitu</em>). Nebuchadnezzar is credited with restoring temples, ziggurats, and canals.</p>
    <p>Legends speak of the <strong>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</strong>, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World—though their existence remains debated.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>After Nebuchadnezzar, the empire faltered under weaker rulers. Nobility resented Nabonidus’s religious reforms, while external threats loomed. In 539 BCE, <strong>Cyrus the Great of Persia</strong> marched on Babylon.</p>
    <p>According to the Cyrus Cylinder, he entered the city peacefully, presenting himself as Marduk’s chosen. The Neo-Babylonian Empire had fallen, absorbed into the vast <strong>Achaemenid Persian Empire</strong>.</p>

  <section class="content-section" id="historiography">
    <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

    <h3>What We Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The destruction of Jerusalem and Babylonian Captivity reshaped Jewish history and biblical tradition.</li>
      <li>Nebuchadnezzar II was both a conqueror and a master builder, restoring Babylon’s grandeur.</li>
      <li>Cuneiform records and the Cyrus Cylinder provide unique perspectives on the empire’s final years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Assume</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Hanging Gardens may have existed, though some scholars suggest they were in Nineveh instead.</li>
      <li>Nabonidus’s devotion to Sin alienated the priesthood of Marduk, weakening loyalty in Babylon.</li>
      <li>Persia’s relatively smooth takeover may have been aided by Babylonian dissatisfaction with their last kings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Were the Hanging Gardens real, and if so, who built them?</li>
      <li>How did ordinary Babylonians experience the Persian conquest—was it welcomed or resented?</li>
      <li>What role did internal conspiracies play in the empire’s downfall?</li>
    </ul>
