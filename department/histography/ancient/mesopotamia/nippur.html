  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Located on the Euphrates in central Sumer, Nippur’s early settlement dates back to the Ubaid period. It became a focal point for religious authority, centered around the temple of <strong>Enlil</strong>, the chief deity of the Sumerian pantheon.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Nippur’s significance was primarily religious rather than political. Kings from across Sumer sought to legitimize their authority through patronage of Enlil’s temple, making Nippur a center of cultural and ceremonial importance.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High priests of Enlil who controlled religious and economic activities.</li>
      <li>Royal patrons who funded temples and public works.</li>
      <li>Scholars and scribes who maintained records and knowledge of Sumerian culture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Repeated rebuilding of temples and city structures following floods or invasions.</li>
      <li>Political influence through religious authority, mediating between rival city-states.</li>
      <li>Integration into larger empires while retaining religious centrality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>The city’s patron was <strong>Enlil</strong>, god of air, authority, and kingship. Religious rituals and festivals reinforced both local identity and the legitimacy of distant rulers.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>While political influence waned with the rise of southern powers such as Ur and Babylon, Nippur remained an important religious and cultural center throughout the 2nd millennium BCE. It continued to function as a ceremonial and scholarly hub even under foreign dominion.</p>
