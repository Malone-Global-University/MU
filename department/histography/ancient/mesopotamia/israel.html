  <h1>Israelite Kingdoms (c. 1050–586 BCE)</h1>
  <p>The Israelite Kingdoms emerged in the ancient Levant, evolving from a tribal confederation into the united monarchy of Saul, David, and Solomon, later splitting into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah before falling to Assyrian and Babylonian conquest.</p>
</section>

<main>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Israelites emerged as a tribal confederation in the central hill country of Canaan around 1200 BCE. Early society was organized around clans, pastoralism, and local shrines. Archaeological evidence suggests gradual urbanization and interaction with neighboring Canaanite cultures.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and the United Monarchy</h2>
    <p>By c. 1050 BCE, the Israelites formed a monarchy to unify tribes against regional threats. Saul became the first king, followed by David, who established Jerusalem as the political and religious capital, and Solomon, who expanded trade, built the First Temple, and strengthened centralized governance.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Saul</strong> — First king, united tribes, defended against Philistines.</li>
      <li><strong>David</strong> — Consolidated power, captured Jerusalem, expanded territory.</li>
      <li><strong>Solomon</strong> — Famous for wisdom, trade alliances, and construction of the First Temple.</li>
      <li>Prophets such as <strong>Samuel</strong> and <strong>Nathan</strong> — Influenced kings and social-religious policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Battles and Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conflicts with the Philistines, Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites.</li>
      <li>Establishment of Jerusalem as the political and religious center.</li>
      <li>Trade and diplomatic relations with Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Arameans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Worship of Yahweh became central, evolving from early polytheistic practices with local Canaanite influences. The First Temple symbolized centralized worship, priestly authority, and national identity.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Division and Decline</h2>
    <p>After Solomon’s death c. 930 BCE, the kingdom split into Israel (north) and Judah (south). Israel fell to Assyria in 722 BCE, leading to the exile of ten northern tribes. Judah persisted until Babylon conquered Jerusalem in 586 BCE, destroying the First Temple and initiating the Babylonian Exile.</p>
