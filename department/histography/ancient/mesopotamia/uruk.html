  <h1>Uruk (c. 4000–310 BCE)</h1>
  <p>Uruk was a pioneering Sumerian city-state, known for the earliest writing systems, monumental temples, and legendary kings, including the hero Gilgamesh.</p>
</section>

<main>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Uruk emerged along the Euphrates River as one of the first true urban centers in Mesopotamia. Its early settlement, dating to 4000 BCE, saw advances in architecture, administration, and social organization that laid the foundation for Sumerian civilization.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Uruk’s growth was fueled by agriculture, trade, and technological innovation. The city developed monumental temples (ziggurats) and became the birthplace of cuneiform writing, enabling complex administration and record-keeping.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Gilgamesh — semi-mythical king celebrated in the Epic of Gilgamesh, exemplifying the city’s legendary status.</li>
      <li>Ensi (local rulers) — oversaw administration, religious activities, and urban planning.</li>
      <li>High priests and scribes — managed temples, economic records, and cultural production.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Expansion into surrounding territories to secure farmland and trade routes.</li>
      <li>Military engagements with neighboring city-states, including Umma and Lagash.</li>
      <li>Participation in cultural and religious networks across Mesopotamia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Uruk’s patron deity was <strong>Inanna (Ishtar)</strong>, goddess of love, war, and fertility. Her temples served as religious, political, and economic centers.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>Uruk gradually declined as political power shifted to other Sumerian cities, including Ur and Lagash, and later to Babylonian control. By the first millennium BCE, it remained inhabited but had lost most political significance.</p>
