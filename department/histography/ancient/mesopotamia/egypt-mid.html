  <h1>Ancient Egypt: Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE)</h1>
  <p>The Middle Kingdom represents Egypt’s reunification and consolidation after the First Intermediate Period. It is celebrated for political stability, literary achievements, and a renewed focus on public works.</p>
</section>

<main>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Following the collapse of the Old Kingdom, Egypt fragmented into rival nomes and dynasties. The Theban kings of the 11th Dynasty, under <strong>Mentuhotep II</strong>, reunified Upper and Lower Egypt around 2055 BCE, ushering in the Middle Kingdom.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Achievements</h2>
    <p>The Middle Kingdom consolidated central authority, stabilized the economy, and revived monumental architecture and art. Pharaohs extended irrigation projects and mining expeditions into Nubia and the Sinai.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mentuhotep II</strong> — Reunified Egypt; established centralized control.</li>
      <li><strong>Senusret I</strong> — Strengthened administration, expanded trade, and undertook major building projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Senusret III</strong> — Military campaigns in Nubia, fortifications along the southern border, and religious reforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Amenemhat III</strong> — Peak prosperity, extensive irrigation works, and development of the Faiyum region.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>The pharaoh remained divine, but Middle Kingdom texts emphasized moral responsibility and justice, particularly the <strong>concept of Ma’at</strong>. Gods such as Amun, Osiris, and Hathor featured prominently in state and personal worship.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>The end of the Middle Kingdom around 1650 BCE coincided with political fragmentation and the incursion of the <strong>Hyksos</strong>, Semitic rulers from the Levant who controlled northern Egypt. Weak pharaohs and regional governors undermined central authority, leading into the Second Intermediate Period.</p>
