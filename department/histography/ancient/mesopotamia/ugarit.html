  <h1>Ugarit (c. 1450–1200 BCE)</h1>
  <p>A vibrant Canaanite city-state, Ugarit was a hub of trade, diplomacy, and culture, renowned for the earliest known alphabetic script.</p>
</section>

<main>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Located on the Mediterranean coast in modern Syria, Ugarit flourished as a port city connecting Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and Egypt. Archaeological evidence shows urban planning, temples, and early fortifications by the mid-2nd millennium BCE.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Ugarit thrived through maritime trade, diplomatic correspondence, and cultural exchange. It developed the first fully alphabetic cuneiform script, influencing later Phoenician and Greek writing systems.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>King Niqmepa — expanded trade and maintained diplomatic relations with Egypt and Hittite empires.</li>
      <li>High priests — managed temple economies and religious ceremonies for gods such as Baal, Dagan, and Anat.</li>
      <li>Scribes — developed and maintained the alphabetic cuneiform system and kept extensive archives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ugarit’s prosperity was closely tied to maritime trade in the Mediterranean.</li>
      <li>Diplomatic correspondence with major powers, including the Amarna letters archive.</li>
      <li>Destruction around 1200 BCE, likely linked to the movements of the Sea Peoples during the Late Bronze Age collapse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Ugarit worshiped a pantheon including <strong>Baal</strong> (storm god), <strong>Dagan</strong> (chief god), and <strong>Anat</strong> (goddess of war and fertility). Religious rituals were central to civic and diplomatic life.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>Ugarit was destroyed around 1200 BCE, likely by the Sea Peoples or related regional upheavals, ending its political independence. Its alphabetic script, however, influenced future civilizations, leaving a lasting cultural legacy.</p>
