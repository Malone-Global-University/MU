  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Isin, located in central southern Mesopotamia, rose to prominence following the decline of Ur III. Initially a regional settlement, it became the administrative seat of rulers attempting to restore order in Sumer.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Isin dominated southern Mesopotamia during the Isin-Larsa period. Its kings maintained bureaucracies, oversaw religious institutions, and competed militarily with Larsa for control of trade and canals.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ishbi-Erra</strong> — Founder of Isin dynasty, previously an official under Ur III; established independent rule.</li>
      <li><strong,Gungunum</strong> — Rival ruler of Larsa, representing the primary competition during Isin’s ascendancy.</li>
      <li>High priests and scribes managing temples and state records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Military campaigns against Larsa and other southern city-states.</li>
      <li>Construction of temples, city walls, and canal projects to consolidate power.</li>
      <li>Issuance of administrative texts and early legal documents to codify governance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Isin’s patron deity was <strong>Enlil</strong>, god of wind, authority, and law. Temples dedicated to Enlil and other Sumerian gods reinforced political legitimacy and societal cohesion.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>Isin gradually lost influence to Larsa, which captured key territories and trade routes. By 1763 BCE, Isin’s political independence effectively ended, though it remained a religious and cultural center for a period afterward.</p>
