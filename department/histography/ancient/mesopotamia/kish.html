  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Kish was located north of the Euphrates, strategically positioned for trade and defense. Archaeology shows settlement from the Jemdet Nasr period, evolving into a major urban center by the Early Dynastic era.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Kish gained prominence as a political and military hub. According to the Sumerian King List, kings of Kish were among the first to assert authority across Sumer, symbolizing the restoration of kingship after a mythical flood.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Etana</strong> — Legendary king, associated with “heavenly ascent” myths.</li>
      <li>Early dynastic rulers who expanded Kish’s influence across central and northern Sumer.</li>
      <li>Priests and temple officials supporting religious and administrative structures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Military campaigns against neighboring city-states to assert dominance.</li>
      <li>Control of trade routes between northern and southern Mesopotamia.</li>
      <li>Reconstruction and fortification of city walls and temples after conflicts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Kish’s patron deity was <strong>Inanna</strong>, goddess of war and love, reflecting the city’s dual focus on military and civic life. Temples and cult centers reinforced the authority of kings and integrated religious practice with governance.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>Kish gradually lost political dominance as southern cities like Ur and Uruk rose in power. By the end of the early 2nd millennium BCE, Kish remained inhabited but no longer a major political force, although its legendary status persisted in Mesopotamian culture.</p>
