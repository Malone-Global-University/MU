  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Akkad emerged in central Mesopotamia along the Tigris River. While its exact location remains unknown, textual sources highlight its strategic position between Sumerian city-states, enabling political consolidation and trade control.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Influence</h2>
    <p>Under Sargon of Akkad (c. 2334 BCE), Akkad became the capital of the first empire to unite northern and southern Mesopotamia. The city functioned as the political and military command center, coordinating campaigns, collecting tribute, and administering a vast bureaucracy.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sargon of Akkad</strong> — Founder and first emperor; conquered Sumerian city-states and established imperial administration.</li>
      <li><strong>Rimush and Manishtushu</strong> — Successive rulers who consolidated Akkadian authority and defended the empire.</li>
      <li>High officials and scribes managing taxation, trade, and governance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Events and Conflicts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conquest of Sumerian city-states (Ur, Uruk, Lagash, Kish) under Sargon.</li>
      <li>Military campaigns in Syria, Anatolia, and Elam.</li>
      <li>Rebellions by vassal cities, requiring suppression and political reforms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Akkad maintained Sumerian religious traditions. Temples and rituals honored gods such as <strong>Inanna</strong> and <strong>Enlil</strong>, while the king was seen as divinely sanctioned to rule and maintain order (mêšaru).</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline</h2>
    <p>By 2154 BCE, Akkad faced environmental stress (possible drought), internal revolts, and incursions by the Gutians. The city’s political significance waned, and it eventually disappeared from the historical record, leaving only textual references and legends.</p>
