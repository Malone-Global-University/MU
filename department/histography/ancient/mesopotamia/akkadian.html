  <h1>The Akkadian Empire</h1>
  <p>The world’s first empire, forged by Sargon of Akkad, where city-states fell under one crown, armies marched across deserts, and new gods rose alongside kings.</p>
</section>

<main>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>In the late 3rd millennium BCE, the fertile plains of Sumer were dotted with rival city-states. Into this mosaic of power stepped <strong>Sargon of Akkad</strong>, a man whose humble origins remain shrouded in myth — a foundling set afloat in a basket, a cupbearer who seized destiny.</p>
    <p>From his new capital, <em>Agade (Akkad)</em>, Sargon built an army unlike anything Mesopotamia had seen before, one loyal to him rather than to a city-temple. This shift in political structure marks the dawn of empire.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>The Rise of Empire</h2>
    <p>Sargon’s campaigns united Sumer, extended into Elam, and reached as far as Syria and Anatolia. Trade routes opened, tribute flowed, and Akkadian language spread as the new diplomatic standard.</p>
    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sargon of Akkad</strong> — founder and conqueror, ruling for over 50 years.</li>
      <li><strong>Enheduanna</strong> — Sargon’s daughter, high priestess of Ur, and the world’s first named author, composing hymns to Inanna/Ishtar.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notable Battles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conquest of Uruk and Ur — breaking Sumerian resistance.</li>
      <li>Wars in Elam — eastward expansion into highlands.</li>
      <li>Campaigns into Syria and Anatolia — securing trade in metals and timber.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deities in the Empire</h3>
    <p>The Akkadians honored both Sumerian and Semitic gods, blending traditions. <strong>Ishtar (Inanna)</strong> became the patron of kingship and war, while <strong>Shamash</strong> (sun god) and <strong>Enlil</strong> retained their ancient prestige.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Collapse and Legacy</h2>
    <p>After Sargon’s death, his grandsons faced revolts, invasions, and famine. The empire weakened under pressure from the <strong>Gutians</strong>, mountain tribes who toppled Akkadian rule around 2154 BCE.</p>
    <p>Though short-lived, the Akkadian Empire established the blueprint for later powers: centralized bureaucracy, standing armies, and the ideology of universal kingship.</p>
