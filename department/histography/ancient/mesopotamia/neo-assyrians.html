  <h1>Neo-Assyrian Empire (c. 911–609 BCE)</h1>
  <p>The Neo-Assyrian Empire was the first true regional superpower of Mesopotamia, known for its military innovations, imperial administration, monumental architecture, and systematic governance over diverse peoples.</p>
</section>

<main>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Neo-Assyrian period began in 911 BCE with the rise of Adad-nirari II, consolidating Assyrian city-states in northern Mesopotamia. This followed a period of decline and foreign domination, with Assyria gradually regaining independence and strengthening its military and administrative systems.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>Rise and Expansion</h2>
    <p>The empire expanded through a combination of military campaigns, vassal treaties, deportations, and strategic colonization, eventually controlling territories across Mesopotamia, the Levant, Anatolia, and Egypt.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adad-nirari II</strong> — Restored Assyrian power and territory after a period of decline.</li>
      <li><strong>Ashurnasirpal II</strong> — Expanded west into Syria and Levant; built the capital at Kalhu (Nimrud).</li>
      <li><strong>Tiglath-Pileser III</strong> — Reformed administration, military, and provincial governance; conquered Israel and Aramea.</li>
      <li><strong>Sargon II</strong> — Consolidated the empire, moved the capital to Dur-Sharrukin, and expanded campaigns into Anatolia and Arabia.</li>
      <li><strong>Esarhaddon</strong> — Invaded Egypt; rebuilt Babylonian relations.</li>
      <li><strong>Ashurbanipal</strong> — Oversaw the empire at its zenith; famous for the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Battles and Campaigns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conquest of Israel (722 BCE) — Northern kingdom annexed, deportations implemented.</li>
      <li>Sieges of Babylon and uprisings in Mesopotamia — maintained imperial control.</li>
      <li>Campaigns into Anatolia, Levant, and Egypt to secure borders and tribute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Assyrian religion centered on Ashur (national god), with other deities like Ishtar, Shamash, and Nabu playing important roles. Kings claimed divine sanction for military campaigns and governance, often recording victories in inscriptions and monumental reliefs.</p>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>After Ashurbanipal’s reign (c. 627 BCE), the empire faced internal strife, rebellions, and external pressures from Babylonians and Medes. Nineveh fell in 612 BCE, followed by Harran in 609 BCE, marking the end of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.</p>
