  <h1>The Neo-Sumerian Empire (Ur III)</h1>
  <p>The last great renaissance of Sumerian culture, where kings of Ur revived ancient traditions, raised monumental ziggurats, and ruled through a vast web of scribes and officials.</p>
</section>

<main>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>In the centuries after the collapse of the Akkadian Empire, Mesopotamia fell into political fragmentation. City-states struggled under Gutian domination and shifting alliances. Out of this turbulence arose <strong>Ur-Nammu</strong>, a local governor who seized power around 2112 BCE and established the <em>Third Dynasty of Ur</em>. His rise signaled a deliberate return to Sumerian traditions—both political and religious—while adapting lessons learned from the Akkadians.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise">
    <h2>The Rise of Empire</h2>
    <p>Under Ur-Nammu and his successors, the city of <strong>Ur</strong> became the radiant heart of Mesopotamia. Vast irrigation projects restored agricultural wealth, temple complexes grew into economic powerhouses, and scribes standardized administrative records across the land.</p>
    <p>The Ur III dynasty created what may be the most centralized bureaucracy of the ancient Near East, carefully tracking grain, livestock, and laborers in tens of thousands of clay tablets that survive today.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ur-Nammu</strong> — Founder of the dynasty, remembered for the <em>Code of Ur-Nammu</em>, one of the world’s earliest known legal codes.</li>
      <li><strong>Shulgi</strong> — Ur-Nammu’s son, who reigned for nearly 50 years, expanded territory, and declared himself a living god.</li>
      <li><strong>Ammar-Sin, Shu-Sin, Ibbi-Sin</strong> — Later rulers who fought to preserve the dynasty against encroaching Amorites and Elamites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Campaigns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ur-Nammu’s wars against the Gutians and rival city-states, consolidating control of Sumer.</li>
      <li>Shulgi’s campaigns eastward into Elam and north into Assyria, extending Ur’s influence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deities and Religion</h3>
    <p>Ur III rulers emphasized loyalty to the great gods of Sumer, especially <strong>Nanna (Sin)</strong>, the moon god of Ur. Ziggurats—towering temple structures—were built or rebuilt in major cities, blending devotion with imperial propaganda. Shulgi promoted himself as a divine king, linking earthly rule with the celestial order.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Collapse and Legacy</h2>
    <p>By the late 21st century BCE, external pressures mounted. Amorite tribes pressed in from the west, Elamite armies attacked from the east, and internal famine undermined the economy. The final king, <strong>Ibbi-Sin</strong>, struggled to hold the empire together as provinces broke away. Around 2004 BCE, Ur itself was sacked by the Elamites, marking the dynasty’s end.</p>
    <p>Despite collapse, the Ur III dynasty left enduring legacies: legal codes, administrative practices, and monumental architecture that influenced Babylonian and Assyrian rulers for centuries to come.</p>

    <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

    <h3>What We Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ur-Nammu issued one of the earliest law codes, predating Hammurabi by centuries.</li>
      <li>Shulgi ruled for nearly 50 years, centralizing power and promoting himself as divine.</li>
      <li>Tens of thousands of Ur III tablets document taxes, trade, and labor systems in detail.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Assume</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Ur III bureaucracy may have been more symbolic than practical outside the Sumerian core.</li>
      <li>Shulgi’s deification could have been political propaganda rather than widespread religious belief.</li>
      <li>Climate stress and drought may have worsened food shortages before the fall.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How far did Ur III influence truly extend beyond Sumer proper?</li>
      <li>Did the system collapse due to external invasion, internal revolt, or ecological crisis—or all three?</li>
      <li>What was daily life like for common farmers under the empire’s strict labor system?</li>
    </ul>
