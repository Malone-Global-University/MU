  <h1>Achaemenid Persia in Mesopotamia (539–331 BCE)</h1>
  <p>When Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon, Mesopotamia became a vital province of a vast empire stretching from the Indus to the Aegean. Persian rule balanced imperial authority with local traditions, ensuring stability for centuries.</p>

  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>In 539 BCE, <strong>Cyrus the Great</strong> captured Babylon, ending the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Mesopotamia became a key satrapy (province) in the Achaemenid Persian Empire, linking the fertile Tigris-Euphrates basin to Persia’s broader imperial network.</p>
    <p>The conquest was remarkable for its relative bloodlessness: Babylonian records and the Cyrus Cylinder describe Cyrus as a liberator and chosen of Marduk, legitimizing Persian rule in the eyes of the local population.</p>

    <h2>Persian Administration and Integration</h2>
    <p>Rather than erasing Babylonian culture, the Persians incorporated it. Local governors, temples, and administrative practices were largely preserved. Babylon remained a ceremonial and economic hub, while Persia centralized imperial control from capitals like Susa and Persepolis.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cyrus the Great</strong> — Conqueror of Babylon; instituted policies of religious tolerance and local autonomy.</li>
      <li><strong>Darius I</strong> — Organized the empire into satrapies, standardized taxation, and built infrastructure connecting Mesopotamia to Persia.</li>
      <li><strong>Xerxes I</strong> — Oversaw periods of stability and military campaigns; continued honoring Mesopotamian religious traditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Policies and Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Religious tolerance: restoration of local temples and respect for Marduk’s cult.</li>
      <li>Efficient administration: introduction of satraps, codified taxation, and imperial roads.</li>
      <li>Infrastructure: canals, roads, and postal systems maintained Babylon as a vital economic center.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>The Persians respected Mesopotamian gods, especially Marduk, while promoting Ahura Mazda and Zoroastrian ideals within the broader empire. Babylonian festivals, rituals, and administrative roles continued uninterrupted under Persian oversight.</p>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>Persian control over Mesopotamia lasted until Alexander the Great’s campaigns. In 331 BCE, the Battle of Gaugamela (Arbela) led to Darius III’s defeat and Alexander’s entry into Babylon. While Persian administration collapsed, Mesopotamian culture, religion, and infrastructure endured, influencing the Hellenistic period.</p>

    <h2>What We Know, Assume, and Still Wonder</h2>

    <h3>What We Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cyrus’s conquest of Babylon was relatively peaceful and legitimized by Babylonian religious ideology.</li>
      <li>Persians maintained Mesopotamian administrative and religious institutions.</li>
      <li>Mesopotamia was a crucial economic and ceremonial center within the Achaemenid Empire.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Assume</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Persian rule was generally accepted because it preserved local traditions, but some resistance likely existed in rural areas.</li>
      <li>Babylonian elites may have collaborated closely with Persian administrators for personal and political gain.</li>
      <li>Persian infrastructural projects extended Babylonian trade networks and communication, though exact details are unclear.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Remains Unanswered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How did ordinary Mesopotamians perceive Persian overlords versus previous native dynasties?</li>
      <li>What was the day-to-day relationship between Persian satraps and local temple authorities?</li>
      <li>How deeply did Persian religion influence Mesopotamian religious practices?</li>
    </ul>
