  <h2>Ancient Egypt: Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE)</h2>
  <p>The Old Kingdom, known as the “Age of the Pyramids,” established pharaonic authority, monumental architecture, and centralized administration that defined early Egypt.</p>
</section>



  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins1">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>After unification under Pharaoh Narmer (c. 3100 BCE), Egypt developed along the fertile Nile Valley. The Old Kingdom emerged in the 3rd millennium BCE, with strong centralized kingship and a divine ideology that linked pharaohs to gods like <strong>Ra</strong> and <strong>Horus</strong>.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise1">
    <h2>Rise and Achievements</h2>
    <p>The Old Kingdom was marked by monumental pyramid construction, administrative organization, and the flourishing of arts and religion.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Djoser</strong> — Built the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, designed by Imhotep.</li>
      <li><strong>Sneferu</strong> — Innovator of pyramid design; Bent Pyramid and Red Pyramid.</li>
      <li><strong>Khufu (Cheops)</strong> — Commissioned the Great Pyramid of Giza.</li>
      <li><strong>Khafre</strong> — Built the second pyramid and the Great Sphinx.</li>
      <li><strong>Menkaure</strong> — Built the third major pyramid at Giza.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Pharaohs were considered divine intermediaries. Ra (sun god), Osiris (god of the afterlife), and Horus (sky god) dominated religious life. Mortuary temples and pyramid complexes reinforced the connection between kingship and divine order.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall1">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>The Old Kingdom collapsed around 2181 BCE due to a combination of factors: internal unrest, weak pharaohs, provincial governors gaining power, and possible Nile failures. This ushered in the First Intermediate Period, a time of decentralization and political fragmentation.</p>

  <h2>Ancient Egypt: Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE)</h2>
  <p>The Middle Kingdom represents Egypt’s reunification and consolidation after the First Intermediate Period. It is celebrated for political stability, literary achievements, and a renewed focus on public works.</p>
</section>


  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins2">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Following the collapse of the Old Kingdom, Egypt fragmented into rival nomes and dynasties. The Theban kings of the 11th Dynasty, under <strong>Mentuhotep II</strong>, reunified Upper and Lower Egypt around 2055 BCE, ushering in the Middle Kingdom.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise2">
    <h2>Rise and Achievements</h2>
    <p>The Middle Kingdom consolidated central authority, stabilized the economy, and revived monumental architecture and art. Pharaohs extended irrigation projects and mining expeditions into Nubia and the Sinai.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mentuhotep II</strong> — Reunified Egypt; established centralized control.</li>
      <li><strong>Senusret I</strong> — Strengthened administration, expanded trade, and undertook major building projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Senusret III</strong> — Military campaigns in Nubia, fortifications along the southern border, and religious reforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Amenemhat III</strong> — Peak prosperity, extensive irrigation works, and development of the Faiyum region.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>The pharaoh remained divine, but Middle Kingdom texts emphasized moral responsibility and justice, particularly the <strong>concept of Ma’at</strong>. Gods such as Amun, Osiris, and Hathor featured prominently in state and personal worship.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall2">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>The end of the Middle Kingdom around 1650 BCE coincided with political fragmentation and the incursion of the <strong>Hyksos</strong>, Semitic rulers from the Levant who controlled northern Egypt. Weak pharaohs and regional governors undermined central authority, leading into the Second Intermediate Period.</p>

  <h2>Ancient Egypt: New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE)</h2>
  <p>The New Kingdom marks the pinnacle of Egyptian power and cultural achievement, with territorial expansion, monumental temples, and iconic pharaohs who shaped history and legend.</p>
</section>


  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins3">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The New Kingdom arose after the expulsion of the <strong>Hyksos</strong> and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I. Central authority was restored, and Egypt embarked on aggressive expansion into Nubia, the Levant, and beyond, establishing itself as a major regional power.</p>

    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>By the late 11th century BCE, Egypt faced economic strain, weak pharaohs, invasions by Libyans and Sea Peoples, and decentralization of power. The New Kingdom collapsed into the Third Intermediate Period, with divided rule and foreign influence in Lower and Upper Egypt.</p>

  <h2>Ancient Egypt: Late Period (c. 1070–332 BCE)</h2>
  <p>The Late Period reflects Egypt’s struggle to maintain independence amid internal division, foreign invasions, and Persian domination, culminating in Alexander the Great’s conquest.</p>
</section>


  <!-- Origins -->
  <section class="content-section" id="origins4">
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Late Period began after the collapse of the New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period, a time of political fragmentation with competing dynasties in Upper and Lower Egypt. Despite instability, native rulers like the 26th Dynasty (Saite kings) attempted to restore centralized authority.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Rise -->
  <section class="content-section" id="rise4">
    <h2>Rise and Cultural Resurgence</h2>
    <p>The Saite Pharaohs (c. 664–525 BCE) restored Egyptian art, religion, and administration. They emphasized classical forms from the Old and Middle Kingdoms, rebuilt temples, and reinforced Egypt’s identity in the face of foreign threats.</p>

    <h3>Key Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Psamtik I</strong> — Reunified Egypt, strengthened trade and military, revived centralized governance.</li>
      <li><strong>Amasis II</strong> — Expanded trade networks, maintained Egyptian cultural traditions, and fortified borders.</li>
      <li><strong>Necho II</strong> — Known for military campaigns in the Levant and attempted canal projects linking the Nile to the Red Sea.</li>
      <li><strong>Psamtik III</strong> — Last native pharaoh before Persian conquest in 525 BCE.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Battles and Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Assyrian invasions in the 7th century BCE destabilized earlier dynasties.</li>
      <li>Persian conquest by Cambyses II in 525 BCE brought Egypt under the Achaemenid Empire.</li>
      <li>Alexander the Great’s arrival in 332 BCE ended Persian control and began Hellenistic rule.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion and Deities</h3>
    <p>Egyptian religious traditions persisted: worship of <strong>Amun-Ra</strong>, Osiris, Isis, and Hathor continued in temples and rituals. Temples rebuilt during the Saite period emphasized continuity and connection to Egypt’s past glory.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Fall -->
  <section class="content-section" id="fall4">
    <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
    <p>The Late Period ended with foreign domination: first by the Persians, then briefly restored independence, and ultimately by Alexander the Great’s conquest. Political instability, economic pressures, and reliance on mercenary armies weakened the pharaonic system, leaving Egypt vulnerable to external powers.</p>
