      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MD104 marks the inflection point in the War College curriculum—where theory meets betrayal, and doctrine is forged in fire. This course tells the story of the Malone betrayal: a case study in treachery, loyalty, and radical transformation. Through that lens, you will learn how every revolutionary is first betrayed—by blood, by state, or by truth—and how what breaks you is what builds your sovereign core.
