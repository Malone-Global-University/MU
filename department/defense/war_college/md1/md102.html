      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MD102 is a core leadership module that sharpens your ability to wield executive power with clarity and conviction. Where MD101 charts the history of government systems, MD102 equips you to lead one. This course focuses on the burden and brilliance of rulership—how to command, defend, and expand your domain under siege, sabotage, or rebellion. Executive authority is not granted—it is seized, held, and justified through results.
