      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Immigration policy must balance compassion, national security, and economic stability. 
        For the African American community, immigration intersects with jobs, wages, political power, 
        and access to public resources. This page clarifies the official stance on how U.S. immigration 
        policy should be structured while protecting the long-term interests of Black Americans.

      <h2>Key Positions</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Protecting Economic Opportunities for Black Workers</h3>
      <p>
        Immigration policy should not depress wages or increase competition for entry-level 
        and working-class jobs, which disproportionately affects African Americans. Enforcement 
        of labor protections, employer accountability, and fair-wage standards are essential.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Border and Visa System Reform</h3>
      <p>
        A secure and organized immigration system is necessary. This includes strengthening 
        border management, fixing visa backlogs, and creating transparent pathways for legal immigration 
        that do not undermine opportunities for U.S. citizens.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Opposition to Exploitative Labor Systems</h3>
      <p>
        Guest-worker and exploitative temporary labor programs often displace Black workers. 
        Reform must prevent corporations from using foreign labor to avoid fair wages and fair hiring practices.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Support for Humanitarian Protections</h3>
      <p>
        The U.S. should remain a refuge for individuals fleeing violence or persecution, 
        while ensuring that humanitarian processes do not create uncontrolled population inflows 
        that overwhelm urban Black communities.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Safeguarding Political Representation</h3>
      <p>
        Sudden demographic shifts can affect political redistricting and dilute the collective 
        voting power of African American communities. Immigration reform must include 
        protections for fair representation.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Prioritizing Domestic Investment</h3>
      <p>
        Policy focus must remain on improving living standards, education, employment, 
        and economic development for African Americans before expanding large-scale 
        immigration programs.
      </p>
