      <h2>Core Position</h2>
      <p>
        Safe, stable, and affordable housing is a foundational human right. For African Americans, housing has long been
        the front line of discrimination—through redlining, predatory lending, urban renewal, land theft, exclusionary
        zoning, and displacement. These policies have systematically blocked Black wealth-building for over a century.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our housing policies must focus on fairness, affordability, anti-discrimination, and creating genuine pathways
        to homeownership and stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Position Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Housing is the foundation of economic stability, community safety, educational opportunity, and generational
        wealth. Because African Americans have faced the harshest housing discrimination in the nation’s history,
        meaningful reform must begin with fairness, accountability, and targeted investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is a future where every African American family has access to stable, affordable housing and equitable
        pathways to ownership and prosperity.
