      <h2>Core Position</h2>
      <p>
        Policing in the United States has historically enforced racial inequality through discriminatory laws, biased
        practices, and unequal protection. The African American community deserves a public safety system that protects
        life, respects human dignity, and operates with full accountability. Our position prioritizes transparency,
        oversight, community trust, and a shift toward evidence-based approaches that reduce harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public safety must be fair, constitutional, and rooted in community partnership—not fear, intimidation, or
        excessive force.

      <h2>Key Principles & Policy Stances</h2>

      <h3>1. Police Accountability & Transparency</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Require independent investigations for all police killings or serious use-of-force incidents.</li>
        <li>Mandate public release of body camera footage within reasonable timelines.</li>
        <li>End qualified immunity or reform it to allow civil accountability for misconduct.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Use-of-Force Standards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Adopt national standards requiring de-escalation as the default approach.</li>
        <li>Ban chokeholds, neck restraints, and dangerous restraint methods.</li>
        <li>Require proportional force policies with strong oversight and disciplinary enforcement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Better Training & Professional Standards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Require extensive training in de-escalation, mental health response, and cultural competency.</li>
        <li>Increase hiring standards to emphasize emotional intelligence and community experience.</li>
        <li>Mandate ongoing annual training—not one-time certification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Demilitarization of Police</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>End the transfer of military equipment (e.g., armored vehicles, heavy weapons) to local police.</li>
        <li>Limit SWAT deployment to genuinely high-risk situations.</li>
        <li>Promote community-focused policing that centers trust, not intimidation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Community-Based Public Safety Solutions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand non-police crisis response teams for mental health, addiction, and homelessness.</li>
        <li>Fund violence prevention programs run by local community organizations.</li>
        <li>Support youth engagement and mentorship programs as long-term safety investments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Data Collection & Public Reporting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Require public reporting of stops, arrests, uses of force, and demographics.</li>
        <li>Create national databases to track officer misconduct and prevent rehiring elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Use data to identify patterns of discrimination or excessive force.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Ending Racial Profiling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ban pretextual traffic stops used to target Black drivers.</li>
        <li>Prohibit racial bias in stop-and-frisk or predictive policing algorithms.</li>
        <li>Ensure disciplinary consequences for officers who engage in discriminatory enforcement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Protecting Black Lives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Support policies that recognize the disproportionate harm policing has caused in Black communities.</li>
        <li>Promote public safety models that reduce police reliance during nonviolent incidents.</li>
        <li>Ensure families receive justice, transparency, and accountability after police violence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Position Summary</h2>
      <p>
        A just policing system protects life, respects rights, and operates under full transparency. The African
        American community deserves equal protection under the law—free from fear of discrimination or violence. Real
        safety comes from accountability, fairness, and investment in community-centered solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is a public safety system that works for everyone, not just the privileged or the protected.
