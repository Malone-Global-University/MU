      <h2>Core Position</h2>
      <p>
        The African American community deserves a healthcare system that is equitable, affordable, accessible, and
        culturally competent. Health disparities are not biological inevitabilities; they result from unequal access,
        discriminatory medical practices, environmental injustice, and socioeconomic barriers. Eliminating these
        disparities requires structural reform—not individual blame.
      </p>
      <p>
        African Americans must have the right to high-quality care, trustworthy providers, and preventative resources
        that improve lifelong health outcomes.

      <h2>Position Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The African American community has long faced inequitable treatment within the healthcare system. The solution
        is structural reform—expanding access, improving accountability, strengthening environmental protections, and
        investing in prevention and culturally competent care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Healthcare is a human right, and African Americans deserve full protection under that right.
