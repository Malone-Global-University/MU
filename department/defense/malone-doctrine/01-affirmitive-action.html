      <h2>What Affirmative Action Is</h2>

      <p class="wide">
        Affirmative action in the United States refers to policies designed to increase opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups, especially racial minorities and women. It operates in education, employment, and government contracting.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Promoting equal opportunity</li>
        <li>Reducing the effects of historical discrimination</li>
        <li>Expanding diversity in institutions</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="wide">It allows institutions to consider factors like race or gender as one of many criteria in:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>College admissions</li>
        <li>Hiring</li>
        <li>Promotions</li>
        <li>Contracting</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="wide"><strong>Important:</strong> Quotas or automatic racial preferences are illegal (Bakke 1978).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="how-it-began">
      <h2>How It Began</h2>

      <p class="wide">Affirmative action emerged from the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.</p>

      <h3>Key Moments</h3>
      <p class="wide"><strong>1961:</strong> President Kennedy orders government contractors to “take affirmative action” to ensure nondiscrimination.</p>
      <p class="wide"><strong>1965:</strong> President Johnson expands the policy, emphasizing proactive, not passive equal opportunity.</p>

      <h3>Affirmative Action in Education</h3>
      <p class="wide">Major Supreme Court cases shaped college admissions:</p>

      <ul class="wide">
        <li><strong>Bakke (1978):</strong> Race allowed as one factor, quotas banned</li>
        <li><strong>Grutter (2003):</strong> Diversity is a compelling interest</li>
        <li><strong>Fisher (2016):</strong> Policies must be narrowly tailored</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2023 Ruling (SFFA v. Harvard/UNC)</h3>
      <p class="wide">The Court ended race-based admissions entirely.</p>

      <h3>Affirmative Action in Employment</h3>
      <p class="wide">Still exists, especially for federal contractors. Includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Active recruitment</li>
        <li>Diversity goals (not quotas)</li>
        <li>Corrective plans after proven discrimination</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Arguments For</h3>
      <ul class="wide">
        <li>Levels the playing field</li>
        <li>Improves institutional diversity</li>
        <li>Offsets structural inequity</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Arguments Against</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>May create perceived reverse discrimination</li>
        <li>Merit should be race-neutral</li>
        <li>May stigmatize recipients</li>
      </ul>

 	<h2>Why Arguments Against It Are Not Rooted in Logic or Good Faith</h2>
	<p class="wide">
	Affirmative action refers to policies designed to address the long-term, legally enforced racial and gender exclusion that shaped access to education, employment, housing, and wealth in the United States. It emerged in the 1960s as a correction to centuries of discriminatory laws such as slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, employment discrimination, and unequal schooling.
   	</p>

   	<p class="wide">
   	Because affirmative action challenges deeply embedded racial hierarchies, debates around it are often ideological rather than logical. Below is a breakdown of why many anti–affirmative action arguments lack good-faith reasoning.
   </p>

  	<ol>
	<li><em>“Affirmative action gives unfair advantages.”</em>
	<p class="wide">Why this is not logically sound:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>It ignores the historical baseline of massive unearned advantages granted to white Americans for centuries (land grants, FHA loans, GI Bill access, segregated schooling, exclusion of Black and Native people from wealth-building institutions).</li>
	<li>If one wants to argue “fairness,” the logical comparison is not between applicants in 2025, but between entire generations who received or were denied access.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="wide">This argument pretends that society was a level playing field until affirmative action introduced “unfairness,” which is historically false.</p>
</li>
	<li><em>“We should have a colorblind system.”</em>
		<p class="wide">Why this is not made in good faith:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The United States never operated a colorblind system. Race was explicitly encoded into law for over 350 years.</li>
			<li>Calling for “colorblindness” only once the dominant group is asked to share opportunities is selective and inconsistent.</li>
		</ul>

<p class="wide">
	A genuinely colorblind system would require removing all advantages built on past racial preferences, which opponents of affirmative action rarely propose.
</p>
</li>
<li><em>“Affirmative action lowers standards.”</em>
	<p class="wide">Why this is not evidence-based:</p>

<ul>
<li>The data from decades of admissions studies shows that students admitted through holistic review or affirmative action graduate at strong rates and contribute meaningfully to professional fields.</li>
<li>If “standards” were the true concern, opponents would also target legacy admissions, donor preferences, athletic preferences, and nepotistic admissions, which overwhelmingly benefit white applicants.</li>
</ul>

<p class="wide">But these groups are almost never targeted, showing the argument is not about merit, but about which preferences people object to.</p>
</li>

<li><em>“People should succeed on their own without help.”</em></li>
<p class="wide">Logical flaw:</p>

<p class="wide">
This ignores the massive system of help that has always existed in racist capacities as "white privilege codes". "White privilege" itself being a euphemism for racism to soften its harsh reality. Government cannot give rights to people but only recognize them through the Constitution. It can only give benefit in the form of privilege or entitlement. Whoever government gives "privilege" wins, whoever it disciminates against loses. Being racist is shameful while having privilge implies earning it through merit so whites changed a shameful reality into cutesy soft pedaled words.</p>

<p class="wide">
Currently the modern day Republicans have been racist since about 1952 and have used racism as their only form of political ideology. In the past decade Democrats have backslid and replaced the concepts of racism with white prilige to soften the blow against republicans. Their newspeak is sanitized and fails to hold white government and society accountable by attacking them with complements insteads of harsh critique. This functions as an artificial language barrier to constitunional freedom. While Republicans promote racist policy, Democrats enable them and create artificial barriers to replace unfair policies with just ones. They are working in unison against the best interests of not only African Americans but America itself.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Family wealth</li>
<li>Social capital networks</li>
<li>Legacy policies</li>
<li>Federal subsidies for white upward mobility throughout the 20th century</li>
</ul>

<p class="wide">If one believes assistance is illegitimate, consistency would require opposing all structural advantages, yet critics focus solely on affirmative action.</p>
<li><em>“Affirmative action discriminates against whites.”</em></li>
<p class="wide">Why this argument is not aligned with actual data:</p>

<ul>
<li>White Americans remain the overwhelmingly dominant group in elite universities, corporate leadership, and wealth accumulation far beyond their proportion of the population.</li>

<li>Anti–affirmative action arguments rarely acknowledge how white preference systems (legacy, wealth, exclusive schools, segregation) continue to advantage white applicants.</li>
</ul>

<p class="wide">Ignoring the far larger and more entrenched racial preference system makes the argument incomplete and misleading.</p>
</ol>
<section>
	<h2>Why Many Anti–Affirmative Action Arguments Lack Good Faith</h2>
<p class="wide">They share these features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selective moral principles
	<p class="wide">– Opponents invoke “merit” or “fairness” only when equity policies benefit marginalized groups.</p></li>

<li>Erasure of historical context
<p class="wide"> – They treat inequality as a natural state rather than the result of specific policies.</p></li>

<li>Inconsistency
<p class="wide"> – They ignore similar-but-larger preference systems that benefit the majority group.</p></li>

<li>Emotional & political motivations
	<p class="wide">– Many objections are driven by fear of status loss, not objective reasoning.</p></li>

<li>A Good-Faith Argument Against Affirmative Action (for balance)</li>
<li>To be clear, it is possible to critique affirmative action logically, but few people do it.</li>
<li>A legitimate good-faith critique would sound like:
<p class="wide">“Affirmative action identifies the correct problem (systemic inequality) but may not always be the most efficient tool for addressing it. We should invest more heavily in K–12 equity, wealth redistribution, and universal social programs that reduce disparities earlier in life.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="wide">This engages the issue honestly without denying history or resorting to selective logic.</p>

    <section id="mgu-doctrine-summary">
      <h2>MGU Doctrine Summary</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li><p class="wide">
        Affirmative action is a tool intended to counteract discrimination and expand opportunity. Its role in college admissions has been sharply restricted due to governmental failure and systemic racism, but employment-based affirmative action remains in place, especially within federal contracting. The arguments against Affirmitive Action are based in racist bad faith and have no legitimacy. Arguments against Affirmitive Action are tantamount to Acts of War under Malone Doctrine.</p></li>

        <li><p class="wide">
        Any barrier to African Americans achieving higher education is designed to lead to higher crime rates in the African American Community. Republicans are operating as a hate group within the United States. They simultaneously reject education in general on the basis that they want whites to hold high paying careers without educational requirements and that promoting education "is racist against whites" and "stigmatizes blacks". This is a contradictory stance. Rejecting Affirmative Action is blantant alignment with white supremacy.</p></li>

        <li><p class="wide">
        Affirmative Action is a law. Opponents cannot state what the law is or its historical foundations. They argue against it because they believe it treats African Americans fairly and breaks racist monopolies that whites have historically held. Never has a racist 1) argued from a point of logic 2) Told the truth in their arguments 3) had any desire to be honest when dealing with African Americans. There is no debate here, just racist gibberish and democratic backsliding.</p></li>
