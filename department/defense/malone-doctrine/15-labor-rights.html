      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Labor and workers’ rights define the balance of power between employees, employers, and government. 
        These policies ensure fair treatment, safe working conditions, and equitable pay for all workers. 
        As the economy shifts—from industrial labor to service work to gig platforms—the structure of labor rights continues to evolve.
