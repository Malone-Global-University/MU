      <h2>Core Position</h2>
      <p>
        Environmental justice is essential for the health, safety, and economic well-being of African American communities.
        These communities have historically been disproportionately exposed to pollution, toxic waste, and environmental hazards
        due to discriminatory zoning, industrial siting, and systemic neglect. Policies must ensure equitable access to clean
        air, water, and green spaces, while reducing harm from climate change and industrial development.

      <h2>Position Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Environmental justice is a civil and human rights issue. African American communities must have equal access
        to clean air, water, and safe living conditions. Addressing historical and current inequities requires proactive
        federal, state, and local policies, community engagement, and corporate accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to ensure sustainable, healthy, and safe environments for all African Americans, today and for
        future generations.
