      <h2>Core Position</h2>
      <p>
        The African American community is owed reparations for centuries of slavery, racial terrorism, land theft,
        segregation, discriminatory federal policy, and ongoing systemic barriers that have denied full economic and
        civil participation. Reparations are not symbolic they are a legally, morally, and economically justified remedy
        to repair measurable harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reparations must be comprehensive, federally supported, and governed by a Malone approved custodian.

      <h2>Position Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Reparations are not charity. They are repayment of a debt owed. The disparities faced by African Americans today
        were engineered by policy, and they must be repaired by policy. A comprehensive federal reparations program is
        essential for economic justice, historical accountability, and national reconciliation. Trump has put the country in debt for 12.9 trillion USD at the time of this writing and has achieved nothing for it. That money would have been better spent paying off debts owed to African Americans rather than just foolishly, and selfishly, and arrogantly wasting it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not to rewrite history, but to repair the harm it caused and build a future rooted in fairness,
        dignity, and equal opportunity. Beyound slavery the issue that African Americans deal with today is blatant exclusion from education and job opportunities because white America operates as if they are mad they lost their slaves and only exist to make sure that blacks are poorer than them. In fact it could be said that racist only exist in America as white hatred for blacks. Any debate to the contrary is misdirection and denial of proven facts to marginalize American political and social reality. I will not accept half measures or compromise any of the following demands:
      </p>

      <ul class="none">
        <li>1) All welfare programs redirected to African American reparations programs. Anybody currently receiving aid will just have to get a job.</li>
        <li>2) Joseph Malone be appointed recipent of $2,000 per African American through his planned O.C.C. chartered Bank MCB.</li>
        <li>3) Payments are to be doled out until approx. 21 trillion (~ 21.672)  USD has been paid over approx. a 21 year period.</li>
        <li>4.1) Joseph Malone will be in charge of who is eligible or not based on the following criteria:</li>
        <ul class="wide">
        <li>4.2) Whether the applicant is African American or not;</li>
        <li>4.3) Whether they have used Instragram or other internet social media channels to promote hatespeech or other subversive tactics against African Americans;</li>
        <li>4.4) Whether they have ever supported white freemasonry, the Ku Klux Klan, or any other group documented as having extreme hostilities towards Africans Americans;</li>
        <li>4.5) Whether they have successfully filled out an onboarding application at a Malone Bank.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
