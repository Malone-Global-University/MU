      <h2>Core Principles</h2>
      <p>Community safety is the foundation of stable, disciplined, and prosperous neighborhoods. For generations, African American communities have endured a system that is simultaneously <strong>over-policed, under-protected, and structurally neglected</strong>.</p>
      <p>MGU’s position is clear: <strong>Safety is achieved through community leadership, not dependency; through opportunity, not surveillance; and through authentic representation, not code-switching policing.</strong></p>
      <p>MGU rejects the idea that African Americans must choose between state hostility and no security. Instead, we advance a third option:</p>
      <blockquote>A new model of policing that integrates African Americans authentically into the civic structure while reducing the long-term need for law enforcement through prevention, opportunity, and community direction.</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section id="key-challenges">
      <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Community Distrust of Police:</strong> African Americans distrust white police due to patterns of racial bias—and distrust African American police when they code switch to reinforce harmful policing norms.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Leadership and Direction:</strong> Violence rises when communities are led by individuals who are uncommitted or constrained by broken systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Barriers to Opportunity:</strong> Neighborhoods trapped in poverty, unemployment, and limited pathways for advancement experience instability.</li>
        <li><strong>Toxic American Culture:</strong> Across races, culture promotes dysfunction; African Americans face additional externally imposed low expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Underinvestment in Preventative Solutions:</strong> Mentorship, recreation, infrastructure, and community design are devalued but crucial for long-term safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Misdiagnosis of Violence:</strong> MGU views violence as systemic and structural—not psychiatric. People are underserved, dismissed, and deprived of purpose.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="policy-positions">
      <h2>Policy Positions</h2>
      <h3>1. Build Authentic African American Policing Leadership</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Recruit and train African Americans from the community to serve as officers without code switching.</li>
        <li>Promote officers who demonstrate integrity, cultural fluency, and fairness.</li>
        <li>Integrate African Americans into law enforcement to break barriers and reconstruct legitimacy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. National Training, Auditing & Cultural Reform</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Establish national training focused on de-escalation, ethics, constitutional conduct, and cultural respect.</li>
        <li>Build independent auditing systems to remove abusive officers—regardless of race.</li>
        <li>Reform policing culture from the inside out while maintaining professional partnerships with existing departments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Strategic Defunding to Reduce Crime at Its Source</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reallocate funds to job training, education, leadership development, and youth opportunity.</li>
        <li>Invest in urban renewal, infrastructure, and environmental design to reduce crime organically.</li>
        <li>Reduce the demand for police rather than eliminating the institution.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Leadership and Opportunity as Foundations of Safety</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand programs that identify, train, and elevate community leaders.</li>
        <li>Create mentorship pipelines for youth and young adults.</li>
        <li>Strengthen economic mobility, entrepreneurship, job creation, and civic participation.</li>
        <li>Reject over-medicalization: people need direction, opportunity, and structure—not labels.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Community-Directed Safety Infrastructure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Establish neighborhood safety councils with real oversight power.</li>
        <li>Allow residents to participate in officer evaluations, cultural standards, and local policy review.</li>
        <li>Develop block-level systems for crisis prevention, conflict resolution, and early intervention.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Prevention-Focused Environmental Design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve lighting, public spaces, sidewalks, vacant lots, and community infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Build parks, recreation centers, and physical training facilities.</li>
        <li>Support community gardens and shared spaces that foster cohesion and reduce isolation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="doctrine-summary">
      <h2>MGU Doctrine Summary</h2>
      <p>MGU’s Community Safety Model <strong>does not abolish policing; it transforms it.</strong> It <strong>eliminates the conditions that produce violence</strong> while ensuring African Americans are fully empowered to lead. Through leadership, opportunity, fairness, and strategic institutional reform, we build a safer Union—one neighborhood at a time.</p>
