        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>
          Community safety is essential for stable, thriving neighborhoods. African American communities 
          have been historically over-policed while under-resourced, resulting in harm rather than protection. 
          Safety can be achieved through local, preventative, and restorative approaches that empower residents 
          rather than rely solely on traditional law enforcement.
