  <section class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Economic power is the backbone of community stability, political leverage, and generational progress.
      African American communities have faced centuries of barriers to wealth creation, including exclusion
      from fair credit markets, employment discrimination, redlining, and limited access to capital.  
      My official stance prioritizes strong entrepreneurship, asset building, workforce advancement,
      and financial inclusion.
