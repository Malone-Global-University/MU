      <h2>Core Position</h2>
      <p>
        Technology and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly transforming society, but unequal access, biased algorithms,

      </p>
      <p>
        Our position focuses on ensuring fair access, unbiased systems, workforce inclusion, and protections against digital harm.
