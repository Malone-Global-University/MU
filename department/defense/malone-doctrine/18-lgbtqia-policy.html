          <h2>Too Long Did Not Read</h2>
          <p>A quick summary of why African gays are non-alignment to modern Black political theory:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gays cannot fight and are pussy. I am building an army and reject sissies</li>
            <li>Gays cannot breed. I am building an army and need breeding programs of Africans to produce more soldiers</li>
            <li>Gays are stupid and say retarded shit about politics, they are all talk no <em>meaningful</em>action. I need down black men who walk the walk not broke leg gays.</li>
            <li>The purpose of being a celibrity is to 1)be gay 2) sellout 3) steoretype all gays into this monolith and call it "shared culture". So fuck James Baldwin and the other coons who speak on issues but contribute nothing. All they do is inject homosexuality and submission to an enemy we are going to brutally destroy... with ease.</li>
            <li>Gays use their orientation to be exempt from fighting, being masculine, or being politically correct. I need serious men who will run the queers out of blck political spaces.</li>
            <li>Gays have shown zero talent at all to contributing to black liberation. They cause more problems then they fix.</li>
            <li>Gays are prone to AIDS. That is not the way to get healthy. They are too sick and bad role models as a result.</li>
            <li>You cannot run an empire based on gay sexual orientation. Homosexually ruins any project. They are losers. I only breed winners.</li>
            <li>Being Gay causes mission drift and divides the race. I need clarity to prevent the type of message dilution gays briing to the table.</li>
            <li>Homosexuality is something any commander forces on the enemy so that they cannot advance as a people. This is a military tactic. Encouraging homosexuality in the military ensures mission collapse.</li>
          </ul>


            <p class="wide">Preferably the white race would be increasing gay. They surrender their women folk. Africans breed the white men and take them as allies. This alliance between Black men and white women could be used to overthrow the white male patriarchy (a.k.a. boys club, a.k.a. cult of Mirtha, a.k.a. state sponsored Illuminati). Gay men will not defy men but women will. Gay men will not support white women against white men but black men will. Gays are hopelessly misaligned and lack any utility in the war against the brotherhood. They are not good enough. This is an important project where success is mission critical. It cannot be trusted to someone who has no understanding, has not been battle tested, and is clearly inept in all ranges of combat and personal conduct.</p>


          <p>I will kick any homosexual out of the black race and dub homosexuals their own race. They are toxic and must be silo'd. This ensures separation of concerns needed for success. If I can replace racist cops with gay white cops, or better yet straight black cops and control the streets legally that would be a plus. My offical position is to force homosexuality on the whites, reserve heterosexuality for the blacks. Cull the number of whites through Fabian straight and loss of attrition, decreased breeding, and stealing all their women folk. I will bribe white women and make the bosses and take jobs from the gay white male elite. This inverts society and gives her a boost to her feminism or whatever. This is very high chance to succeed seeing as she is an evil snake who has no love for white men because she is a witch (illuminati). I have been very transperant and very onsistent about this position from the start. Sell out black women will try to drive a wedge by claiming white women are racist and blah blah blah. they are not military leaders and just lying because they only care about doing anything to trick a man into dating her. Black women are not fighting ANY civil rights issues, NOT ANY, they play with their vote and poitcal voice. They cosplay for attention and are not serious. For the past 20 years the only woman who I have heard be right is Amanda Seale, and she has done so faihtfully. I love her. She is never wrong.
          </p>


          <p>This means I do not speak bad about other races being gay and when confronted by them I make it clear that I am trying prevent AIDS in the black community by restricting homosexuality to other races. Every homosexual who has tried to bait me into arguing has walked away peacefully accepting my position. I DO NOT WANT TO FIGHT GAYS. I DO NOT WANT AIDS EPIDEMICS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. My cause is just and my solutions fair, grounded, and legal. This is pragmatic. To be black means to have repsect for tradition which holds that being gay is mission drift and non-alignment to success. Just like you cannot smoke dope and sell it at the same time you cannot be gay and fight for black rights at the same time. We are fighting emasculation from hollywood and misrepresentation. They make us wear the tyler perry dress and we do not want to. Young Thug is a sellout. Frank Ocean is a sell out.  Any gay rapper is a sel out to never be embraced by the African American community. Africa has a serious governnace problem were they are trying to outlaw homosexuality. That will not work because you cannot legislate morality. You have to educate pragmatic realpolitik based on experience. These African leaders are obvisoulsy gay and operating under politic theater, "do as I say not as I do". That is bitch made. I only lead by example. Never follow a man who will not do the work he asks of you! He is a fraud who is using you as a slave and then taking all the credit for his "leaderaship". That is a fraud! A real leader shares the hardship with his men and is in the trenches with them, is in the fight with them. 
          </p>


          <p>My mind is made up. No gays allowed in the black race. You are free to be gay anywhere but around black centrist political identity. No one is to harm the the other races being gay because that weakens them and that benefits us. They gayer others become the stronger we are, like a pitbull on a chihuahua.</p>

          <p>This is what real leadership looks like. To the coons and sellouts who think they can work for the other team? We are going to fuck you up. I do not lose. You are not killing anything. My military strategy is second to noine. I am more than capable to accomplish stated objectives. To be clear I operate a ruling makority of 5%, I do not give a fying fuck about ninety-nie-percenters and other weak anarchist bullshit. I got clout I am the best. Every nation is ruled by the topo 1% of 1%, they are typically called the elite or illuminati. I am not like you, a poor slave working for AFI SHRINERS. All masons MUST serve so you are not free and not only not trusted bbut identifed, targeted, and tracked. I know your whereabouts. You exist because if prolonged gunfire rangs out can serve as cannon fodder. I am not into killing Africans so focus on holding white America resposible. I show no mercy, I have no remorse, I make zero mistakes. If you dsiss me I will consider you white and took yoiu in the group of house niggas where you belong.</p>
