    <!-- ========== OVERVIEW ========== -->
    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Foreign policy shapes global stability, national security, and economic development. 
        For African Americans, foreign policy also affects diaspora relations, international trade, 
        and the political relationship between the United States and the African continent. 
        A strong Africa is in the strategic interest of Black communities worldwide.

    <!-- ========== PAN-AFRICAN VISION ========== -->
    <section>
      <h2>A Pan-African Vision for the Future</h2>
      <p>
        The future of global Black empowerment depends on the stability, prosperity, and sovereignty of African nations. 
        U.S. policy must abandon old models of extraction and interference and instead support cooperative partnership. 
        A unified Africa strengthens the diaspora, and a politically mobilized diaspora strengthens Africa.
