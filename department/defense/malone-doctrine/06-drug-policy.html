        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>
          The African American community has endured decades of policies that treated addiction as a crime 
          rather than a health issue. From the War on Drugs to discriminatory enforcement practices, the 
          consequences have devastated families, destabilized neighborhoods, and fueled mass incarceration.
        </p>
        <p>
          My platform focuses on healing, treatment, prevention, and economic reinvestment—not punishment. 
          Addiction is a public health issue, and policy must reflect that reality.
