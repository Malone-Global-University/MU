      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Initiate Tier is the entry point for those who wish to understand power at its roots. Students learn historical patterns of governance, core Malone Doctrine concepts, and practical habits of leadership. This tier establishes the intellectual and moral foundation required to progress to Strategist and Commander levels. This phase reshapes how you see power, systems, and yourself. The goal is to break the illusions forced upon you by the illuminati and rebuild your thinking from a Malone Doctrine aligned foundation. You will study the architecture of control, the psychology of obedience, and the frameworks required to operate outside traditional power structures while serving a purpose higher than yourself.
