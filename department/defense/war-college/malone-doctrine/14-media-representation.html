      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Media representation shapes public perception, political decision-making, and community identity. 
        Cultural policy governs how artistic expression, broadcasting, and public narratives are funded, regulated, and distributed. 
        Together, these forces influence democratic participation and social equity.
