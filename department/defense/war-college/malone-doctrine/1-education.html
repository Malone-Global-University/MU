    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Education is the foundational determinant of economic mobility, cultural continuity, and political empowerment
      within African American communities. My official stance emphasizes high-quality instruction, modern curriculum
      reform, equal funding, culturally grounded literacy, and expanded pathways to postsecondary success.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Official Position Statements</h2>

    <article class="position-block">
      <h3>1. Curriculum Reform</h3>
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Schools should integrate accurate African and African American history, cultural literacy, and global Black contributions as core—not elective—content.</p>
      <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Students gain identity, confidence, and critical awareness through representation. Curriculum erasure contributes to disengagement and generational misinformation.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Action:</strong> Establish curriculum standards requiring verified, peer-reviewed historical sources and diaspora studies at every grade level.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="position-block">
      <h3>2. Funding Equity</h3>
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Per-pupil funding should be equalized across district lines to eliminate disparities created by property-tax–based models.</p>
      <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> African American students disproportionately attend underfunded schools lacking labs, technology, modern materials, and experienced teachers.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Action:</strong> State-level restructuring to ensure guaranteed minimum funding regardless of zip code.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="position-block">
      <h3>3. Teacher Quality & Representation</h3>
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Recruit, train, and retain more African American educators, particularly in STEM and advanced placement fields.</p>
      <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Teacher diversity improves academic outcomes, reduces bias, and enhances cultural understanding in classrooms.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Action:</strong> Expand teacher scholarship pipelines and loan forgiveness programs for educators serving in majority-Black districts.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="position-block">
      <h3>4. School Choice & Accountability</h3>
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Families should have access to high-quality public, charter, virtual, and private educational options—provided each institution meets strict accountability standards.</p>
      <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Many African American students live in areas with failing schools; choice can provide immediate alternatives while reform occurs.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Action:</strong> Develop transparent reporting metrics and community oversight boards for all publicly funded schools.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="position-block">
      <h3>5. Technology Access</h3>
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> All students should have equal access to modern technology, digital literacy education, and high-speed internet.</p>
      <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The digital divide disproportionately affects Black communities, limiting opportunities in STEM, remote work, and higher education readiness.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Action:</strong> Federal subsidies and local infrastructure investment to guarantee broadband access in underserved communities.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="position-block">
      <h3>6. Early Childhood Education</h3>
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Universal access to preschool and early literacy programs is essential.</p>
      <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Achievement gaps appear before kindergarten; early interventions dramatically improve long-term outcomes.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Action:</strong> Expand public preschool, literacy screening programs, and parent education workshops.</p>
    </article>
