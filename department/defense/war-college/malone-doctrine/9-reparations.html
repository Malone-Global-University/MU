      <h2>Core Position</h2>
      <p>
        The African American community is owed reparations for centuries of slavery, racial terrorism, land theft,
        segregation, discriminatory federal policy, and ongoing systemic barriers that have denied full economic and
        civil participation. Reparations are not symbolic—they are a legally, morally, and economically justified remedy
        to repair measurable harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reparations must be comprehensive, federally supported, and targeted specifically to the descendants of
        enslaved Africans in the United States.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h3>8. Eligibility Standards</h3>

        <li>Eligibility must be tied to lineage: African American descendants of enslaved people in the U.S.</li>
        <li>Require verifiable ancestry, similar to federal tribal documentation systems.</li>
        <li>Acknowledge that reparations are not based on race alone, but on direct generational harm.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Position Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Reparations are not charity—they are repayment of a debt owed. The disparities faced by African Americans today
        were engineered by policy, and they must be repaired by policy. A comprehensive federal reparations program is
        essential for economic justice, historical accountability, and national reconciliation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not to rewrite history, but to repair the harm it caused and build a future rooted in fairness,
        dignity, and equal opportunity.
