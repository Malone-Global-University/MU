      <h2>Core Position</h2>
      <p>
        Voting is the foundational right of a democracy, yet the African American community has faced generations of
        voter suppression—from poll taxes and literacy tests to modern-day ID laws, gerrymandering, and polling location
        closures. Protecting Black political power requires defending access to the ballot, strengthening civic
        participation, and ensuring representation at every level of government.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every eligible African American citizen must have equal, unobstructed access to vote without intimidation,
        discrimination, or structural barriers.
      </p>

      <h2>Position Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Democracy cannot function when Black Americans face barriers to voting. Protecting the vote means safeguarding
        representation, ensuring equal access to polling, and empowering communities with civic knowledge. A healthy
        democracy requires that African Americans vote freely, fairly, and without obstruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Voting rights are not partisan—they are a civil right that must be defended at all costs.
