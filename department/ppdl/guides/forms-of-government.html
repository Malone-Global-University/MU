    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout history, societies have organized themselves in many different ways. 
        The <em>form of government</em> determines who holds power, how decisions are made, 
        and how citizens interact with authority. Understanding these systems is crucial 
        for comparing political institutions, analyzing history, and engaging in civic life.
      </p>

    <!-- Democracy -->
    <section>
      <h2>1. Democracy</h2>
      <p>
        In a democracy, authority originates with the people. Citizens participate directly or indirectly 
        in decision-making. Hallmarks include free and fair elections, majority rule balanced with 
        protection of minority rights, and an emphasis on individual liberty.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Democracy:</strong> Citizens vote on laws and policies themselves (e.g., ancient Athens, modern referenda).</li>
        <li><strong>Representative Democracy:</strong> Citizens elect leaders to govern on their behalf (e.g., United States, India).</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        “Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the people.” — Abraham Lincoln
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <!-- Republic -->
    <section>
      <h2>2. Republic</h2>
      <p>
        A republic is a form of democracy where the people elect representatives who are bound 
        by a constitution or set of laws. The rule of law, rather than unchecked majority will, 
        defines the framework of authority. Many modern democracies are republics.
      </p>
      <p><em>Example:</em> The U.S. Constitution establishes a republican system of checks and balances.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Monarchy -->
    <section>
      <h2>3. Monarchy</h2>
      <p>
        A monarchy places sovereignty in a single ruler, usually a king or queen. Monarchies can vary greatly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Absolute Monarchy:</strong> The monarch holds unchecked power (e.g., Louis XIV’s France, Saudi Arabia).</li>
        <li><strong>Constitutional Monarchy:</strong> The monarch serves a largely ceremonial role, with actual governance carried out by elected officials (e.g., United Kingdom, Japan).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Authoritarianism -->
    <section>
      <h2>4. Authoritarianism</h2>
      <p>
        Authoritarian governments concentrate power in a single leader or a small ruling group. 
        Political opposition is limited, civil liberties are restricted, and compliance is often enforced through coercion.
      </p>
      <p><em>Examples:</em> Military juntas, one-party states with limited pluralism.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Totalitarianism -->
    <section>
      <h2>5. Totalitarianism</h2>
      <p>
        Totalitarian regimes are the most extreme form of authoritarianism. 
        They seek to control not only politics and the economy, but also society, culture, and even individual thought. 
        Propaganda, censorship, and surveillance are common tools.
      </p>
      <p><em>Examples:</em> Nazi Germany, Stalinist USSR, North Korea.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Oligarchy -->
    <section>
      <h2>6. Oligarchy</h2>
      <p>
        Oligarchy refers to rule by a small, elite group. This elite may derive its power from wealth, family lineage, 
        military control, or other exclusive means. The wider population has little formal influence.
      </p>
      <p><em>Examples:</em> Ancient Sparta (rule by a warrior elite), modern states where wealth or industry dominates politics.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Theocracy -->
    <section>
      <h2>7. Theocracy</h2>
      <p>
        In a theocracy, government authority is based on religious principles. 
        Leaders are often members of the clergy, and laws derive from sacred texts.
      </p>
      <p><em>Examples:</em> Iran (Islamic Republic), the Vatican City (Papal authority).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Hybrid & Modern Systems -->
    <section>
      <h2>8. Hybrid and Modern Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Many modern governments blend elements from multiple systems. For example, 
        a constitutional monarchy may also be a parliamentary democracy. 
        Similarly, some authoritarian governments permit limited elections, creating <em>hybrid regimes</em>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The form of government influences how societies distribute power, protect rights, 
        and resolve conflicts. While no system is perfect, studying their structures 
        helps us better understand the challenges and opportunities of governance in the modern world.
