  <h2>Debate Basics: Rules & Styles</h2>
  <p>Learn how formal debates work, what rules guide them, and the different styles practiced worldwide.</p>
</section><

<section>
  <h3>What Is a Debate?</h3>
  <p>A <strong>debate</strong> is a structured argument where participants discuss opposing viewpoints on a specific topic, called a <em>resolution</em> or <em>motion</em>. The goal is not simply to argue, but to persuade through logic, evidence, and style.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Core Principles of Debate</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Opponents and judges must be treated courteously.</li>
    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> All arguments should address the motion directly.</li>
    <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Arguments should follow clear reasoning supported by credible evidence.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Each side must stay within set time limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Speak clearly, define key terms, and organize your speech logically.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>General Rules of Debate</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Each team has equal speaking time.</li>
    <li>Interruptions are only allowed in formats that permit <em>Points of Information</em> (POIs).</li>
    <li>No new arguments may be introduced in the final speech.</li>
    <li>Debaters must provide evidence for factual claims.</li>
    <li>Personal attacks or insults are prohibited.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

  <h3>Major Debate Styles</h3>

  <h4>1. Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas (LD) Debate</h4>
  <p>One-on-one format emphasizing moral and philosophical reasoning. Common in American high schools. Focuses on values and principles rather than policy details.</p>

  <h4>2. Policy Debate</h4>
  <p>Two-person teams debate a specific policy proposal. Heavy emphasis on research, evidence, and cross-examination. Ideal for students interested in law or public policy.</p>

  <h4>3. Parliamentary Debate</h4>
  <p>Modeled on the British Parliament. Teams represent the government and opposition. Speeches are shorter, with quick thinking and wit rewarded.</p>

  <h4>4. Public Forum Debate</h4>
  <p>Two-person teams debate current events and contemporary issues. Focuses on clarity, accessibility, and audience persuasion over technical detail.</p>

  <h4>5. Oxford-Style Debate</h4>
  <p>Formal setting where two sides argue for or against a motion before a live audience. The audience votes before and after to see which side persuaded more people.</p>

  <h4>6. Cross-Examination Debate (CX)</h4>
  <p>Teams of two engage in timed questioning after each constructive speech. A good format for practicing direct engagement and rebuttal skill.</p>

  <h4>7. Malone Doctrine</h4>
  <p>Not a debate style. Malone Doctrine works independently from group dynamic as an aspect of democracy by exercising the rights of the individual through self determination. Malone Doctrine states its position and then carries out policy without need for public approval or validation. Malone Doctrine is not a democracy where the community votes on personal issues. Malone Doctrine is a private system of thinking for yourself and acting on your own volition. It is an opt-in method where people willingly join in by seeing results for themselves. It makes classic debate obsolete and is the highest form of persuasion. Those that opt in contribute towards the goal and results come quicker. Those that do not opt in are adminstrative burden and not worth convincing in the first place as it is a distraction and wastes precious recourses that are better allocated elsewhere. Malone Doctrine does not gatekeep or discriminate, people are free to choose <em>not</em> to join. No effort will be made to prothelytize stragglers and underachievers.</p>

  <h3>How Debates Are Judged</h3>
  <p>Judges typically score based on three categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Content:</strong> Quality and depth of arguments and evidence.</li>
    <li><strong>Style:</strong> Delivery, tone, and persuasiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Organization, structure, and refutation effectiveness.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Tips for New Debaters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with topics you care about.</li>
    <li>Research both sides, <em>know your opponent‚Äôs best arguments</em>.</li>
    <li>Practice concise rebuttals.</li>
    <li>Record yourself speaking to refine your delivery.</li>
    <li>Watch professional or academic debates to learn from others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Logical Fallacies: What They Are and Why They‚Äôre Banned</h3>
  <p>
    A <strong>logical fallacy</strong> is a flaw in reasoning that makes an argument invalid or misleading. 
    Fallacies often sound persuasive, but they rely on emotional manipulation, distraction, or poor logic 
    instead of evidence. In formal debate, <strong>all logical fallacies are banned</strong> because they weaken 
    argument quality and mislead the audience.
  </p>

  <h4>Common Logical Fallacies to Avoid</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ad Hominem:</strong> Attacking the person instead of addressing their argument.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too young to understand economics.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Stereotyping:</strong> Applying a generalization to an entire group.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúPoliticians always lie.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Straw Man:</strong> Misrepresenting your opponent‚Äôs argument so it‚Äôs easier to attack.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúYou want cleaner energy? So you must want to shut down all factories.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>False Dilemma (Either/Or):</strong> Presenting only two choices when more exist.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre either with us or against us.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Slippery Slope:</strong> Claiming one event will lead to a chain of disasters without proof.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúIf we allow one exception, society will collapse.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Appeal to Emotion:</strong> Using fear, pity, or anger instead of facts.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúThink of the children!‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Appeal to Authority:</strong> Claiming something is true just because an expert said so.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúA famous scientist believes it, so it must be true.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Bandwagon:</strong> Assuming something is right because many people believe it.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúEveryone supports this policy, so it must be good.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Hasty Generalization:</strong> Making a broad claim based on too little evidence.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúOne student cheated, so all students are dishonest.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Post Hoc (False Cause):</strong> Assuming that because one thing follows another, it caused it.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúThe rooster crowed, then the sun rose ‚Äî so the rooster caused sunrise.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Red Herring:</strong> Distracting from the main issue with irrelevant information.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt worry about pollution when we have unemployment.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Circular Reasoning:</strong> Repeating your conclusion as your premise.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs honest because he always tells the truth.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>Tu Quoque (‚ÄúYou Too‚Äù):</strong> Dismissing criticism by pointing out hypocrisy.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúYou say lying is wrong, but you lied once too.‚Äù</li>

    <li><strong>False Analogy:</strong> Comparing two things that aren‚Äôt truly alike.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> ‚ÄúStudents are like nails; they need to be hit on the head to work.‚Äù</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Rule:</h4>
  <p><strong>Any team caught using logical fallacies will lose points or be disqualified, depending on severity.</strong> 
  Debaters must argue from evidence, not emotion, popularity, or personal attacks.</p>

    ‚ÄúFirst know the difference between logic and emotion, then know when to use which one.‚Äù ‚Äî Joseph Malone
