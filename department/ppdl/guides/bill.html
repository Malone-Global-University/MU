  <ol class="process-steps" aria-label="Steps for how a bill becomes a law">
    <li>
      <h3>1. Drafting & Introduction</h3>
      <p>A member of Congress (Representative or Senator) sponsors and formally introduces a bill. Revenue bills must start in the House.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>2. Committee Review</h3>
      <p>The bill goes to a relevant committee and may be sent to a subcommittee. Committees hold hearings, collect testimony, amend the bill, and decide whether to report it to the floor.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>3. Floor Debate & Vote (First Chamber)</h3>
      <p>If the committee reports the bill, the full chamber debates it, may propose more amendments, then votes. A majority vote sends the bill to the other chamber.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>4. Committee Review & Vote (Second Chamber)</h3>
      <p>The second chamber (House or Senate) repeats the process: committee review, possible amendments, and a floor vote.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>5. Reconciliation</h3>
      <p>If the House and Senate pass different versions, a conference committee (members from both chambers) negotiates a single final text. Both chambers then vote on that final version.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>6. President’s Decision</h3>
      <p>The bill goes to the President, who can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sign it — it becomes law.</li>
        <li>Veto it — Congress can override with a two-thirds vote in both chambers.</li>
        <li>Take no action — after 10 days it becomes law if Congress is in session; if Congress adjourns, the bill dies (a "pocket veto").</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>7. Implementation</h3>
      <p>Once signed (or otherwise enacted), the executive branch implements and enforces the law; often agencies create regulations to carry it out.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <h4>Quick Facts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Most bills never make it out of committee.</li>
      <li>A simple majority is usually enough in each chamber (except for overriding a veto or changing Senate rules).</li>
      <li>Some laws begin as identical bills introduced in both chambers (called companion bills).</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>

  <footer class="student-summary">
    <h4>Student Summary (one sentence)</h4>
    <p>A bill becomes a law after introduction, committee review, approval by both the House and Senate in the same form, and the President’s signature (or a successful veto override).</p>
