      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This unit surveys the principal legal texts and sources that structure the United States government:
        the <strong>U.S. Constitution</strong> and its constitutional amendments, the <strong>Bill of Rights</strong>,
        foundational statutes, treaties, executive actions, and binding judicial precedent. Students will learn
        how these documents interact, how authority is allocated among branches and between federal and state
        governments, and how legal interpretation shapes public policy.
