      <h2>Lecture: The Vertical Division of Power</h2>
      <p>
        Federalism organizes political power vertically. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the United States for the states or the people. In practice, that reservation coexists with broad federal powers (Commerce Clause, taxing power) and with federal influence through conditional grants.
      </p>

      <h3>Preemption</h3>
      <p>
        Courts analyze preemption in different ways: express preemption is straightforward, but implied preemption requires interpretation: has Congress occupied the field or would state law frustrate federal objectives? Preemption doctrines often implicate federalism tensions and policy tradeoffs.
      </p>

      <h3>State constitutionalism</h3>
      <p>
        State constitutions can offer protections beyond federal minima. State courts interpret their constitutions and may expand civil liberties locally. Thus, federal constitutional law sets a floor, not always a ceiling.

    <section id="activity">
      <h2>Comparative Brief</h2>
      <p>Choose a state constitutional provision (example: state free-speech clause, state privacy provision) and write a 600-word brief comparing it with the relevant federal constitutional protection. Assess whether the state protection is broader and why.</p>
      <p><strong>Rubric:</strong> comparative analysis (40), textual & historical support (30), clarity & citations (20), mechanics (10).</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states or the people the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution. (2 pts)</li>
          <li>Field preemption occurs when federal regulation is so pervasive in a particular area that it is inferred Congress intended to occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation. (2 pts)</li>
          <li>Example: some state constitutions interpret privacy clauses more broadly than the federal Constitution, offering greater protections against state search-and-seizure or data-collection practices. (4 pts)</li>
