      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify landmark Supreme Court decisions and explain their legal holdings and impact.</li>
        <li>Practice briefing cases: facts, procedural posture, issues, holdings, reasoning, and dissents.</li>
        <li>Evaluate how precedents evolve and how later decisions can refine or overrule earlier holdings.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="case-summaries">
      <h2>Selected Cases (brief)</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Marbury v. Madison (1803)</dt>
        <dd>Established the principle of judicial review: courts can declare federal statutes and executive acts unconstitutional.</dd>

        <dt>McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)</dt>
        <dd>Confirmed broad federal powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause and held that states may not tax federal institutions.</dd>

        <dt>Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)</dt>
        <dd>Interpreted the Commerce Clause to allow Congress substantial regulatory authority over interstate commerce.</dd>

        <dt>Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</dt>
        <dd>Held that state-sponsored school segregation is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, overturning the "separate but equal" doctrine in public education.</dd>

        <dt>Additional notable opinions</dt>
        <dd>This unit will also consider decisions shaping free speech, criminal procedure, federalism, and administrative law. Students should be aware that legal doctrine evolves; some holdings have been modified by later cases.</dd>
