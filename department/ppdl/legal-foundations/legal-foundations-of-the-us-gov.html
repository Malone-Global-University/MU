      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>List and define the principal sources of U.S. law: constitutional text, statutes, treaties, executive actions, administrative regulations, and judicial decisions.</li>
        <li>Explain the constitutional hierarchy (the Constitution as supreme law) and the role of the Supremacy Clause.</li>
        <li>Describe how separation of powers and federalism allocate authority in the U.S. system.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Core Content</h2>
      <p>
        The U.S. legal order rests on several interlocking sources:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Constitutional text:</strong> the U.S. Constitution is the highest law; it creates institutions and defines powers.</li>
        <li><strong>Statutes:</strong> laws enacted by Congress and codified in the United States Code.</li>
        <li><strong>Treaties:</strong> international agreements made by the President and ratified by the Senate; they have force of federal law.</li>
        <li><strong>Executive acts and regulations:</strong> orders by the President and rules created by federal agencies to implement statutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Judicial decisions:</strong> courts interpret statutes and the Constitution; Supreme Court rulings are authoritative federal law on constitutional questions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Hierarchy and interaction:</strong> the Constitution overrides contrary federal statutes and treaties; federal law preempts conflicting state law under the Supremacy Clause. Courts settle ambiguities and resolve conflicts through interpretation and precedent.
