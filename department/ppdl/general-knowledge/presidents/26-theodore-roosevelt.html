<h2>üü¢ The Good ‚Äì The Progressive Reformer and Bold Leader</h2>

<h3>Progressive Domestic Reforms</h3>
<p>
	Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th U.S. President (1901‚Äì1909), championed the Square Deal, focusing on consumer protection, corporate regulation, and labor rights. He broke up monopolies, enforced the Sherman Antitrust Act, and promoted fairness in business.
</p>
<h3>Conservation and Environmental Leadership</h3>
<p>
	Roosevelt was a pioneering conservationist. He established national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges, protecting millions of acres of land for future generations.
</p>
<h3>Strong and Assertive Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>
	Roosevelt expanded U.S. influence internationally with the motto ‚ÄúSpeak softly and carry a big stick.‚Äù He oversaw construction of the Panama Canal, mediated the Russo-Japanese War (winning a Nobel Peace Prize), and built up the U.S. Navy.
</p>
<h3>Charismatic Leadership and Public Engagement</h3>
<p>
	Roosevelt inspired the public with his dynamic personality, energy, and oratory. He encouraged civic responsibility and created a modern conception of an activist presidency.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>üîµ The Bad ‚Äì Aggressive, Arrogant, and Controversial</h2>

<h3>Imperialist Policies</h3>
<p>
	Roosevelt supported U.S. imperial expansion and intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean, often disregarding the sovereignty of other nations through policies like the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine.
</p>
<h3>Overbearing Leadership Style</h3>
<p>
	Roosevelt could be domineering and controlling, centralizing power in the executive branch and sometimes undermining Congress or other institutions.
</p>
<h3>Mixed Record on Race</h3>
<p>
	While Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington to the White House, he also sanctioned segregation in federal offices in some cases and largely ignored systemic racial inequality.
</p>
<h3>Labor Conflict Management</h3>
<p>
	Although he intervened in the 1902 coal strike, Roosevelt‚Äôs approach often favored negotiation over structural reform, leaving broader labor inequalities unaddressed.
</p>

<h2>üî¥ The Ugly ‚Äì Controversies and Hard Realities</h2>

<h3>Use of Executive Power</h3>
<p>
	Roosevelt‚Äôs aggressive use of executive authority alarmed critics who feared the presidency was becoming too powerful. His assertiveness sometimes bordered on authoritarianism, according to opponents.
</p>
<h3>Environmental and Social Trade-offs</h3>
<p>
	While Roosevelt promoted conservation, some policies favored resource extraction for strategic purposes, such as timber and mineral use, showing contradictions between environmental ideals and national interests.
</p>
<h3>Legacy Polarization</h3>
<p>
	Roosevelt‚Äôs boldness and public persona made him both highly admired and intensely criticized. His interventionist foreign policy and progressive domestic policies remain controversial among historians, reflecting the complexity of his presidency.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt was a bold, reform-minded president whose good lay in progressive domestic policies, conservation, and dynamic leadership. His bad was aggressive, sometimes overbearing executive behavior and imperialist policies; his ugly was the moral and political trade-offs of interventionism and his mixed record on race. Roosevelt embodies the energetic, transformative presidency of the early 20th century, with both inspiration and controversy in equal measure.
