Economic Expansion (Pre-Pandemic)
Donald J. Trump, the 45th U.S. President, presided over low unemployment rates, stock market growth, and GDP growth from 2017 through early 2020, largely fueled by tax cuts (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) and deregulation.

Judicial Legacy
Trump successfully appointed three Supreme Court justices and numerous federal judges, shaping the judiciary for decades and influencing key legal decisions on issues like abortion, religious liberty, and federal power.

Deregulation and Business Policies
He rolled back environmental and business regulations, aiming to boost domestic industry, manufacturing, and energy production, with a focus on ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù economic policy.

Criminal Justice Reform
Trump signed the First Step Act (2018), a bipartisan effort to reform sentencing laws, reduce recidivism, and improve prison conditions.

üîµ The Bad ‚Äì Divisive Leadership and Policy Controversies

Polarizing Rhetoric
Trump‚Äôs communication style and rhetoric, including frequent social media posts, fueled national division, protests, and political polarization.

Immigration Policies
Policies like the ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù family separation policy at the southern border and the travel ban on certain countries generated widespread criticism and legal challenges.

Handling of COVID-19 Pandemic
Trump‚Äôs response to COVID-19 was criticized for mixed messaging, delayed action, and conflicts with health experts, contributing to high infection and mortality rates.

Environmental Rollbacks
While promoting energy independence, Trump reversed key climate policies, withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, and weakened environmental protections.
