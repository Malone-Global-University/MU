<h2>ðŸŸ¢ The Good â€“ The Reformer and International Visionary</h2>
<h3>Progressive Domestic Reforms</h3>
<p>
	Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. President (1913â€“1921), implemented significant Progressive Era legislation. His New Freedom program lowered tariffs (Underwood Tariff), reformed banking (Federal Reserve Act), and strengthened antitrust enforcement (Clayton Antitrust Act).
</p>
<h3>Labor and Social Protections</h3>
<p>
	Wilson supported labor rights, including the eight-hour workday for railroad workers and the establishment of the Federal Trade Commission, promoting fair competition and workersâ€™ protections.
</p>
<h3>Leadership During World War I</h3>
<p>
	Wilson guided the United States through World War I, providing stability, mobilizing the economy, and raising public morale. His leadership helped the Allies and strengthened Americaâ€™s international role.
</p>
<h3>International Vision â€“ League of Nations</h3>
<p>
	Wilson was a leading advocate for the League of Nations, envisioning a post-war world of collective security, diplomacy, and conflict prevention, laying groundwork for later international organizations.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>ðŸ”µ The Bad â€“ Racism and Limited Domestic Enforcement</h2>

<h3>Racial Policies</h3>
<p>
	Wilsonâ€™s administration segregated federal offices and allowed discriminatory practices in government employment. He also failed to challenge racial violence and lynching, cementing systemic inequality.
</p>
<h3>Repression of Dissent</h3>
<p>
	During WWI, Wilson supported the Espionage Act (1917) and Sedition Act (1918), limiting free speech and suppressing anti-war dissent, including targeting socialists and labor organizers.
</p>
<h3>Inconsistent Progressive Record</h3>
<p>
	While promoting reform, Wilson sometimes sided with conservative business interests and failed to fully address womenâ€™s suffrage until political pressure made it inevitable (19th Amendment ratified 1920).
</p>
<h3>Health and Leadership Limitations</h3>
<p>
	A stroke in 1919 left Wilson incapacitated for months, and his wife, Edith Wilson, took a leading role in managing presidential duties, raising questions about governance during a national crisis.
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>ðŸ”´ The Ugly â€“ International Overreach and Domestic Failures</h2>

<h3>Treaty of Versailles and League Rejection</h3>
<p>
	Wilsonâ€™s idealism for the League of Nations faced domestic opposition. The U.S. Senate rejected the treaty, undermining his foreign policy vision and contributing to future global instability.
</p>
<h3>Authoritarian Governance Style</h3>
<p>
	Wilsonâ€™s reliance on executive authority, especially during wartime, and his suppression of dissent has been criticized as overly authoritarian, conflicting with democratic principles.
</p>
<h3>Legacy Tarnished by Racism</h3>
<p>
	Despite progressive reforms, Wilsonâ€™s policies reinforced racial segregation and disenfranchisement, leaving a lasting stain on his historical legacy.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Woodrow Wilson was a transformative yet controversial president. His good lay in progressive reforms, labor protections, and visionary internationalism. His bad included inconsistent domestic enforcement and suppression of dissent; his ugly was entrenched racial segregation and the failure of the League of Nations. Wilsonâ€™s presidency demonstrates the tension between idealism and practical governance, and the enduring consequences of racial and authoritarian policies.</p>
