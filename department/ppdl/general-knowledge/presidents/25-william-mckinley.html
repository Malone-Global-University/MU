üîµ The Bad ‚Äì Expansionism and Controversy

Imperial Ambitions
McKinley supported the annexation of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War. While these moves expanded American influence, they sparked debate over imperialism and the ethics of overseas colonial rule.

Economic Elitism
His protectionist policies favored industrialists over farmers and workers in some regions, creating tension between urban and rural populations.

Political Caution and Indecision
McKinley often relied on advisors and Congress to make decisions, which critics argue limited his decisiveness in domestic reforms and delayed responses to emerging social issues.

Labor Discontent
During McKinley‚Äôs presidency, strikes and labor unrest occasionally flared. While not uniquely his fault, his administration‚Äôs pro-business stance drew criticism from labor groups.

üî¥ The Ugly ‚Äì Assassination and the Dawn of a New Era

Assassination
On September 6, 1901, McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz and died on September 14, 1901. His death shocked the nation and ushered in the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, signaling a shift toward more progressive policies.

Philippine-American War
The annexation of the Philippines led to the Philippine-American War (1899‚Äì1902), a bloody conflict with high civilian and military casualties, tarnishing the moral legacy of McKinley‚Äôs expansionist policies.

Historical Overshadowing
Though effective, McKinley is sometimes overshadowed by Roosevelt and the progressive era that followed. His presidency is often remembered more for his death and imperial controversies than domestic achievements.
