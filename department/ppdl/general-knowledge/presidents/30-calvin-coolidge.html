<h2>üü¢ The Good ‚Äì The Steady, Fiscal Conservative</h2> 

<h3>Economic Stewardship</h3>
<p>
	Calvin Coolidge, the 30th U.S. President (1923‚Äì1929), presided over a period of economic prosperity, known as the ‚ÄúRoaring Twenties.‚Äù He promoted low taxes, limited government spending, and minimal regulation, fostering business growth and investor confidence.
</p>
<h3>Honest and Unassuming Leadership</h3>
<p>
	Coolidge earned the nickname ‚ÄúSilent Cal‚Äù for his quiet, deliberate style. He avoided scandal, maintained personal integrity, and embodied a sense of moral rectitude in public office.
</p>
<h3>Support for Business and Industry</h3>
<p>
	Coolidge championed pro-business policies, encouraging industrial expansion and innovation, which helped fuel economic growth and national optimism.
</p>
<h3>Government Efficiency</h3>
<p>
	He emphasized efficiency and restraint in government, cutting unnecessary programs and advocating for streamlined administration.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>üîµ The Bad ‚Äì Limited Vision and Social Neglect</h2>

<h3>Inattention to Social Issues</h3>
<p>
	Coolidge largely ignored labor unrest, racial tensions, and agricultural distress, leaving many Americans behind despite general economic growth.
</p>
<h3>Overreliance on Business Prosperity</h3>
<p>
	His policies favored urban and industrial interests, often at the expense of farmers, small businesses, and marginalized groups, contributing to economic inequality.
</p>
<h3>Laissez-Faire Approach</h3>
<p>
	Coolidge‚Äôs commitment to limited government meant he rarely intervened in economic or social crises, which some critics argue set the stage for the Great Depression.
</p>
<h3>Political Apathy</h3>
<p>
	Coolidge often avoided controversial initiatives and preferred minimal legislative action, which limited progressive reforms and broader national improvements.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>üî¥ The Ugly ‚Äì Missed Warnings and Historical Overshadowing</h2>

<h3>Agricultural Depression Ignored</h3>
<p>
	While urban industries thrived, farmers suffered low prices and debt during the 1920s. Coolidge largely ignored their struggles, worsening rural hardship.
</p>
<h3>Prelude to the Great Depression</h3>
<p>
	Critics argue that Coolidge‚Äôs policies of deregulation, minimal oversight, and fiscal conservatism contributed to the speculative excesses that led to the 1929 stock market crash.
</p>
<h3>Overshadowed by Prosperity and Successors</h3>
<p>
	Coolidge‚Äôs cautious approach made him less memorable than more dynamic presidents. He is often overshadowed by Roosevelt‚Äôs response to the Great Depression and the flamboyance of the 1920s cultural scene.

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Calvin Coolidge was a steady, fiscally responsible president whose good lay in honesty, government efficiency, and economic prosperity. His bad was limited vision and inattention to social and agricultural issues; his ugly was the neglect of systemic economic risks that helped set the stage for the Great Depression. Coolidge demonstrates the strengths and limits of quiet, hands-off leadership during times of national growth.</p>
