I was taught this in school along with Manifest destiny. As I have gotten older I realize that the education received on The East Coast and the Southern United States is not the same as the West Coast.  The difference is greater between private and public school.


Some areas apologize for Americas past while others cover up or deny wrong doing. This creates two Americas where science, historical contributions by African Africans, or corruption in government is viewed differently. Without the same access to information there does not exist a fair playing field for social advancement.


I am building a website in three layers. The first layer gives a quick overview of the official story. Purpose is to quickly cover areas that adults may not know or have been glossed over in their education. The second layer makes deep connections and provides a way forward to build a stronger country. The third layer assigns written assignments and homework and serves as a classic liberal education. Goal is to prevent the monopolization of and by institutions that gatekeep, hoard, or worse distort information.
