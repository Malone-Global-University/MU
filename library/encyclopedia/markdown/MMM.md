Your intimidating “M” shelf
A collection of works, each with a different high-gravitas Latin title — all in the Malonianus family — but each implying a different type of knowledge.
1. The Encyclopedic Master
Magnum Regium Malonianum Rerum Index Omnium
The Great Royal Malonean Index of All Things
(Your magnum opus. Encyclopedic. World-spanning.)
2. The Scholarly Handbook
Malonianus Rerum Enchiridion Universale
The Malonean Universal Handbook of Things
(Compact but deep. The “practical genius” volume.)
3. The Philosophical Tome
Malonianus Regius Epitome Sapientiae
The Royal Malonean Summary of Wisdom
(Makes people think you’ve distilled Aristotle and Newton into one book.)
4. The Historical Record
Index Regius Malonianus Historiae Orbis
The Royal Malonean Index of the History of the World
(Sounds like you own the master chronicle of civilization.)
5. The Language Authority
Malonianus Rerum Lexicon Universale
The Malonean Universal Dictionary of Things
(The intimidating “dictionary so big it could kill a man” volume.)

Even as blank-page “dummy” books with ornate leather spines — the visual intimidation factor will be enormous.
You could even vary the spine colors: deep oxblood for history, navy for science, emerald for philosophy, black for the encyclopedic volumes.

If you want, I can design a matching set of 17th–18th century style title pages and spines for all these names, so your shelf looks like the Vatican Secret Archives but with “Malonianus” everywhere. That would be true intellectual theater.
