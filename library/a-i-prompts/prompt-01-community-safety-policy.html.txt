Prompt used for 01-community-safety-policy.html:

A. What do you believe is the role of police?


I need to integrate African Americans into the government to break color barriers and perceptions of racial bias.


Currently the African American community does not trust white police for fear they are racially biased. They do not trust African American police who they believe code switch and reinforce white police. What We the community need is African American police who do not code switch and who are not self-hating or target the African American community harshly to show support for bad white cops.
This last point is a serious point of contention.


B. How radical do you want this platform to appear?


I want to train African Americans from the community to apply as policemen.

I would work with local police to build a national platform for training, de-escalation, and auditing of bad police conduct.

I would defund the police and target the sources of crime and thus reducing the need for police while reforming the culture inside police departments.


C. What do you believe fundamentally causes violence?


Number one, a lack of leadership by competent and committed individuals. Number two, lack of opportunity. Number three, a toxic American culture, of all races, that intentionally sets people up for failure by design. African Americans are especially targeted for this treatment given social expectations from outside races.


D. What is the worldview of MGU?


MGU is a response to failed leadership, bad actors, apathy from all sectors, and general self-destruction of State. Joseph Malone is tasked with two objectives: Increased freedom and legal wealth for African Americans. He strives to accomplish this through coordinating efforts across all sectors of American life to build a blueprint for a better Union. Cores ideas are a combination of Education + American exceptionalism + civic participation + urban renewal + heath and exercise + self-determination + profound sense of fairness + fine legal drafting. Executing Malone Doctrine is aimed at absorption of all legacy models to reflect this civilization upgrade. I target broken models and fix or replace them focusing on results and efficiency.


P.S. I highly question the effectiveness of mental health given the barriers are systemic not mental. People are not crazy, they are dismissed and silenced. They are not depressed, they are poor and lack direction in life.
