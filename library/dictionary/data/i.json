  "definition":[
    "Interconnected elite groups representing all sectors of modern times who use power and influence to control the masses and everday life. Often depicted as satanic bloodlines that use old world power structures to consolidate wealth and power. While dismissed by sellouts and shills as nonexistant these groups have existed for millenia and serious, not fringe, academic scholars have noted consistent trends of how these groups how worked throughtout time. This coupled with the fact most people eventually run into these groups and have personal antedoctal experience of them, the illuminati cannot be dismissed as a false theory such as J. Edgar Hoover tried to do concerning the American Mafia despite documented evidence of him working with him and photographed leaving F.B.I. headquarters during the years he was making these statements."],
