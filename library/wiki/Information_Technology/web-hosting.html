Web hosting is the process of making website files available on a computer (called a server) that is connected to the internet 24/7 so other people can access them.

Here’s what that involves:

Website files – Your website consists of files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and sometimes databases.

Server – These files are stored on a server. A server is a computer optimized to send data to visitors quickly and reliably.

Hosting provider – A company that owns and manages servers offers space for your files, provides an internet connection for the server, and ensures uptime and security.

Domain connection – Your domain name (like example.com) is configured to point to the server’s address (IP address) so people can find your site.

Server software – The server runs software (such as Apache, Nginx, or LiteSpeed) to process requests from visitors’ browsers and send them the correct files.

Types of hosting – Common options include shared hosting (many websites on one server), VPS (virtual private server), dedicated hosting (one site per server), and cloud hosting (distributed resources).

Additional features – Hosting often includes storage space, bandwidth limits, backups, SSL certificates, security tools, and technical support.

Without hosting, your website files would remain only on your personal computer and would not be accessible on the public internet.</xmp
