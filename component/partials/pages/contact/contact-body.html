        <h1>About Me</h1>
 
  <p>
     I am Joseph Malone, I am loyal to Tupac Shakur’s legacy, committed to exposing and dismantling the entrenched systems of power that govern our world. He fell in battle so I am picking up his sword.

  <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
  <p>
    I believe the world is controlled by interconnected elite networks — old banking dynasties, secret societies, corporate conglomerates, and political parties — that consolidate wealth and influence to maintain their power at the expense of fairness and justice. These systems are complex, resilient, and often hidden in plain sight, but they are not invincible. My mission is to empower you with the hard skills in political socio-economics to understand, challenge, and ultimately tear down the beast piece by piece.

  <h2>My Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Through rigorous education and strategic insight, I provide tools to decode these power dynamics and build alternative, transparent structures that empower communities rather than control them. This is a call to action to reclaim sovereignty over our political, economic, and social systems — to replace secrecy and oppression with knowledge and liberation.
