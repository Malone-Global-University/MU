Right now I need to:


1. Lock in CSS and main.js in python script (done)
2. Build a better default template them lock that into python script (not done). I need to clarify:


- How do I add submenus for navigation and what wil the layout look like?
- How will I replace the functional design I have now with a more professional tall header at the top of all pages with school logo?
- How to place main home navbar under header
- How to place submenu under navbar
- How to place pace headers under submenu 


Design goals:
1. Header at top with school logo on left, School Name prominent in center.
2. A responsive main navbar that has links to root index, about, contact, founder, mission, departments, and library.
3. main.js script (done)
4. footer (done)


I really am stuck at nailing the static homepage. The top of pages needs work. Anything under main is covered for now (main.js + footer). The first step is building a consistent header at the top of pages with school logo to the left and school name on the right. This is basic design but I do not remember how to do it correctly. 


Help me design a more powerful template that serves as the base for all pages. Once that is done I can generate indexes for all department folders. Then I can use converter to ssn generator new pages for any department.
