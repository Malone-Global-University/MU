The partial folder contains HTML components for injecting into pages. Templates contain full pages or modular skeletons to be inserted with HTML elements using div tags.


The library folder is deep. It will grow very deep to be almost a standalone site. The encyclopedia follows interesting content that is not necessarily course required; it provides explained definitions and covers other topics, much like Wikipedia. The dictionary is standard American English. Focus is on building vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Small words are omitted, while long words, frequently misspelled words, or technical words are added, keeping the dictionary slim but purposeful.

Right now I need to:




- How do I add submenus for navigation?
- How will I replace the functional design I have now with a more professional tall header at the top of all pages with school logo?
- How to place main home navbar under header
- How to place submenu under navbar
- How to place pace headers under submenu 


Design goals:
1. Header at top with school logo on left, School Name prominent in center.
2. A responsive main navbar that has links to root index, about, contact, founder, mission, departments, and library.
3. main.js script (done)
4. footer (done)
or new pages for any department.
