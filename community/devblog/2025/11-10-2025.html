  <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p class="wide">This is general information people should know. I am making this accessible without having to wade through a bunch of theory and academic or scholary gatekeeping. Not the most vital information but is helpful to know. Everything I teach is designed to make people as smart and effective is me. Everything is taught in a manner to be weaponized against corrupt systems.Many politician scandals are sex involved. Some are real while others are distractions. For example Clinton/Lewninsky sex scandal was to distract from the bombing of medicine factories in Africa that were falsely accussed of building weapons. Many people lost access to live saving malaria medicine. This is a war crime. I remember when it happened because I was at home arounf 12:15 when a special message from Bill Clinton interupted the broadcast to announce what he did. I was supposed to be at school but wasn't so was one of the people from my age group who witnessed Democratic Presidents engaging in warhawk-like behavior.</p>

      <p class="wide">I guess the purpose is both to inform and document every instance of government abuse as a form of patriotism and civic responsibility. Entries are brief. People can quickly see a long pattern of government abuse and form their own conclusions. After visiting my page people can search the internet and do their own research. Their exist entire sites dedicated to atrocities and individua events that contain first hand accounts from witnesses and whistle blowers. I cannot match that level of authenticity so will link to approprite sites as is helpful.</p>

<!-- Lessons -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p class="wide">People are scared of my website and want me to be another fake woke black freemason a.i. churned social media channel. I am building an institution not a monetized "me" page. They (internet stalkers) said to be truly "sovereign" to contain all material on my site. This is stupid and improper. They are vain, greedy, and without talent. I have been making webpages since 1999. Noithing has chnaged since then. Occasionally I get helpful tips, as one would from random acquaintances, but nothing earth shattering. Most of it is gatekeeping. Cross-linking increases SEO ratings and makes my site more professional not less. They are trying to make my site obscure., nothing more. Telling me to do something counterproductive flags them as a risk which creates a target on their entire group and politics. It is not "free" to play dirty tricks on me. There is always unrelenting retribution and accountability. I play real life Grandchess Board with higher stakes than them and it is highly personal for me.</p>
