    <!-- Details -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p class="wide">There are five courses in the Culinary Department:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>baking</li>
        <li>cooking</li>
        <li>grilling-frying</li>

        I am looking for user submitted recipes with pictures of final dish. This would add to the UNITY of the Diaspora. I want to build a page that is an interactive map that when you click on a country it shows what blacks are eating in all 6 continents. This could boost tourism and global unity. My ideas always work.

  <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Build self reliance and control what we eat</li>
        <li>Stop paying leeches $15 for a crispy chicken sandwich we can make for $4</li>
        <li>Build black owned resturants</li>        
        <li>Provide political free exchange of social ideas</li>        
        <li>Build partnerships through African Diaspora only this time without gayass Instagram</li>
        <li>Eat better, live better</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="wide">
            This is the first part of a multi-part food plan. When people know how to cook they are less dependent on food banks because they can stretch food dollar very far, even if it means tuna fish sandwiches or meatless speaghetti some days. In extreme cases we can budget $2-S6 a day for food. This means more vegatables and shopping at whatever store yields consistent low prices or shopping only during monthly sales and stocking up in advance. IF sauce is normally $3 and it is on sale for $1 then we do not buy 5 we buy 20. We stock pile and but in secure location. We buy spare freezers and fridges. We buy Freestanding pantries to store spice, dry foods, and canned items. This prevents wasted money on eating out or gas to constantly buy just a few items.

<!-- Lessons -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        I posted on Instagram that I might do a culinary department as a way to be more inclusive. White supremacists and black sellouts promoted MAGA and then started talking about they "like anything delicious". So they kill any attempts at peace and can go fuck themselves. Blacks say they wany unity but are full of shit. I know they are sellouts to white freemasonry, which is devil worship, which involves them being anti-black and sacrificing their race for loyalty. Bottom line this website is doing its job to filter who is real and who is a traitor. This is a bulleproof vetting system.  
      </ul>

    <!-- Next Steps -->
    <section class="blog-next">
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>📌 Set up subdepartment for user submitted recipes</li>
        <li>📌 Learn more about what black home cooks are eating and cooking</li>
        <li>📌 Use food as a neutral diplomatic policy</li>
        <li>📌 Encourage proper diet and regular exercise</li> 
      </ul>
