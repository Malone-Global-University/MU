      <h2>What’s New</h2>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>✅ Uploaded 57 pages to <a href="/department/history/america/north/usa/home">United States History Home page.</a></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Details -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p class="wide">I have begun templating the 50 states and territories home pages for state history. This is all American history, not just African American. There are 50 states, 6 terrirtories, and Washington D.C pages up. Over time content will grow and pages will get longer. Phase 1 has me using A.I. to create basic information and structure. Phase 2 I will do independent research and add new sections unique to each state's charateristics. Phase 3 I will physically travel to each state and contact the local historical society and talk to residents. Older people who have lived in the area will be able to provide authentic insight into the area and hidden history. This will be styled like a Ken Burns Documentary. Black residents will be especially useful in providing key details of how black communities have evolved over time. Phase 4 will expand overseas.</p> 

      <p class="wide">Through this project I hope to set up networked black communities and ultimately a new political party to protect and serve their varied interests. I believe that many so-called pro-black groups are a front for conspiracies against the very missions they claim to serve. To vet every member of the community I will examine their groups and claims to black loyalty. I will map and categorically list them. This will create a living document of active black thought and political representation in America. The goal is to create a single register of black communities and connect them to identify key politics and core values so as to ascertain whether unity is possible and under what conditions. I am being proactive and weaponizing every class on this site to destroy the enemies of freedom, truth, and legal wealth. It is clear no one has the courage to do what I am doing so I have to accept the mission.</p>

  <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p class="wide">Caucasin and African American schools have failed me in the past. There exists conspiracies to exclude certain African American and white students from learning. This is because they are targeted by the elite. My school addresses these pragmatic issues. I am not an emotion driven school. Every class is designed to transfer my skill set to others. This is to prevent them from harm. No other school can claim this. This education will give students core knowledge needed to improve quality of life by preventing explotation from freemasons and similiar destructive groups. Everything is their fault because corruption of the world lies with them.</p>

<!-- Lessons -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p class="wide">From this I learned that it is okay to use a spiral method to teach main points of each state and then move on. To pass American high school a student needs to study their states history. This leaves them pigeon holed in one area to which they are tied to similar to serf feudalism. Understanding more areas encourages travel which fosters trade and political unity with other groups.</p>

      <p class="wide">I have realized for a long time to see how the illuminati harms the African diaspora I have to travel to each area and see how they use different tactics to divide and disorientate. Different groups will have different politics based on the different traps thrown at them. This is by design to make unity difficult as people isolated to one area cannot understand how others are suffering.</p>

      <p class="wide">
       Social media makes long format and easy communicate impossible. It is not a real account of accurate life. It is a trojan horse advertised as helping organize political movements but all it does is surveil and extract data that it later imitates to highjack movements. These lessons are not critical for success but they do expand beyond traditional teaching in school and provide valuable opportunies to build social networks.</p>
