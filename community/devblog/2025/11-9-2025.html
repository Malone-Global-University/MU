    </section>


    <!-- Details -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p class="wide">Conspiracy Department investigates subversion against the African Community. This deals with mainly with political and corporate conspiracies. As a legal term a conspiracy is just a crime that is alleged but has not been proven yet.  For example "conspiracy to commit armed robbery". The racist Harry Anslinger, former asshole and first Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics of U.S. Government, did many very bad things. To cover then up he used media, propaganda, and planted the idea that if government was accussed of doing anything wrong they should be labeled, "crazy conspiracy theorists". Only sell-outs and idiots use the term "conspiracy" to imply mentall ill as it is a perfectly normnal word for everyday scientific and legal conversations.</p>

      <p class="wide">Engineering department teaches how to make inventions and machines. A list of African inventors is being curated at <a href="https://maloneuniversity.org/department/engineering/inventors/home">https://maloneuniversity.org/department/engineering/inventors/home</a>. I do not care about pride in racial acheivements as much as ending arguments with racists who insist that blacks do not contribute anything to society, or take credit for others work, or try to use these arguments to shame blacks or waste their time lying to people they think are stupid. A simple google search with instatly prove that blacks contributed many contributions and useful innovations. Why this is not talked about more seriously than the occasional reference serves as proof to white indifference to black suffering. If the truth was told, as I am going to do, then racism would be less of an issue. The the systems appearantly need a blend of black ignorance and confusion to survive or else they would wither and die. This is not a "I am doing this to make blacks happy" but an attack towards white supremists. They are out of control with fake news and are not teaching the public correctly.

  <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p class="wide">The purpose is to expose enemies and have them arrested. The purpose is to educate blacks so instead of arguing online they can just say " Here are the citations that prove you are lying: https://maloneuniversity.org/department/engineering/inventors/home". The purpose is to expose racism in Hollywood and build black media channels outside white power zones of influence. They build nothing, contribute nothing, are accountable for nothing, and are ashamed of nothing.

<!-- Lessons -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p class="wide">It is eaiser to educate Africans than argue with whites. It is easier to argue with whites by slapping them with "here is proof you are wrong, shut up" than making long logical arguments that look soft and do not prevent further abuse.</p>
