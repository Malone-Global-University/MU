    <!-- Summary -->
    <section class="blog-summary">
      <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
      <p>This marks the transition to my strong points which is political and economic warfare and leadership.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Updates -->
    <section class="blog-updates">
      <h2>What’s New</h2>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>✅ Uploaded the <a href="/department/political-science/black-political-views/leaders/home">African Leaders home page and 78 subpages</a>.</li>     
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Details -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p class="wide">The page is broken down into twelves sections that group people by leadership type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>abolitionists</li>
  <li>advocates
  <li>allies</li>
  <li>antagonists</li>
  <li>black-panthers</li>
  <li>civil-rights</li>

  </li>
          </section>

  <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose is to clarify what is deemed a success and failure of past leadership. Many black intellecuals are frustrated at lack of social progress and have critiques of past leadership but have not formalized their viewpoints. The trend on social media is to promote failures as success and attack correct strategy as mistakes.</p>

       <p>I am going to study in depth what these peoples strong points weakenesses were. The point is to prevent making the same mistakes, build more resilent plans, and prevent backsliding. History is not going to repeat itself. Hard fought gains are not going to be lost. Enemies will be identified and eliminated from interferring with success.</p>

      <p><strong>Update:</strong> We have identified where the fake news and accounts on social media is coming from: Silicon Valley Jew programmers. They are using false flag attacks to agitate blacks. This does not help the African American plight but serves to divide and conquer through: A. Cutting lines of communication. B. Disrupting alliances. C. Interferring with strategy. A-C are the precepts of war. Silicon Valley Jews have unofficially declared war on the African American Community.</p>

<!-- Lessons -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
     <p>1. Jews are using fake news to destroy African Americans, then frame it as a necessary evil.</p>
     <p>2. They have no respect for Black Independence and will always be a problem.</p>
     <p>3. Blacks have sold out and are cooning for them. They are promoting segregation and the roll back of histrical successes</p>
     <p>4. Some black leaders are not given the credit they deserve while others are blindly praised. Intent does not erase impact. Believing in the cause does not mean every strategy was sound.</p>
     <p>5. The 1960-1970's were fraught with confusion. the methods used then were idealistic, not military science. As such they do not hold up today.</p>
     <p>6. The 1930-1940's relied heavily on Communism/Socialism. These methods are inappropriate in 21st century Black America. Communism is only meant as a short term solution or it leads to human rights abuses. Socialism only works on very small scales and cannot be applied to nation wide levels. Democracy/Capitalism is the only civilized educated response. Fascination with other approaches is guided by ignorance. Africans distrust Capitalism due to associating it with foreign extraction, but they are blind to the fact that they are entitled to use Capitalism for their own benefit.   </p>
     7. Enemy Combatants: White Supremacists, Zionist Jews, White and Black freemasons and their fans, Self serving Democrats, Racist Republicans, gangs and other criminals who commit senseless violence harming goal through non-cooperation, and coons who promote enemy agenda over truth or backstab in various real life through clandestine activities.
