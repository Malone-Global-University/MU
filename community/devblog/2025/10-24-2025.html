    <!-- Details -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>In the original Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson makes 27 grievances against King George III. These are considered very foul actions, inexcusable, even by white mens standards. The Declaration of Black Independence lists the grievances of Black America in a structured way to show parallels between white America's treatment of it's black citizens and tha of King George's treatment of the 13 colonies. I am sure at least one black man has made similiar arguments before using this concept but I do not know who. The idea here is that African Americans can ignore mindless race baiting online and focus on systematic documentation of key black politics that can be used to educate the youth. These are to be universally agreed beleifs, stances, and conditions for victory that are not contested within the black community.</p>
      
      <p>
        A summarized account of the Transatlantic Slave Trade has been added. This is provided to counter myths told by racists.  
      </p>

      <p>A page addressing claims that 13% of the American population commits 50% of the crime had been added. This is provided to counter lying with statistics told by racists.</p>
          </section>

  <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This is a draft for formal redress.</p>
      <p>Black political thought should focus on defending the freedom of African Americans, not past battles that are already settled law. Whites who only talk about slavery skew facts to weaponize the past to distract from matters of real importance. Blacks who only talk about slavery: 1. Do so in a ham-fisted way 2. Ignore modern-day plight 3. Fall into diversionary traps that distract from more important tasks.</p>
      <p>There are several mathematical, linguistic, and socio-logical problems with the way racists argue. This particular argument is exposed by presenting it as logically flawed and racist, meaning that any person using it is intentionally racist and lying by abusing language and math for dishonest purposes. </p>

<!-- Lessons -->
    <section class="blog-">
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>1. Use slavery as an afterthought to shame white men and remove any credibilty they cling to as having any notion of moral high ground.<br><br>
         2. Explain slavery as a lesson of white men's incurable racism towards black people.<br><br>
         3. Slavery = white men are racist and not artibers of truth nor facts.<br><br>
         4. Slavery = Civil War = Military Conquest over white supremacy = Settled law.<br><br>
         5. Slavery is settled law. While documenting it is historically important to look down on whites for all eternity, it does not directly address the current conflict of the past four decades and is reductive.<br><br>
         6. The moral of slavery = Whites are racist. The end.<br><br>
         7. Whites are ashamed of slavery so talk about it nonstop to shame blacks for being slaves. This is not a sentiment for my generation. 
         We cannot take seriously a race who uses the double speak of "shame on you for being slave" contrasted with "stop playing the victim card".<br><br><br>

         8. These mixed messages are repeated abuse. We do not debate. We state our position. While they debate to influence black thought through sophistry these political position are set in stone and non-negotiable.<br><br>

         9. White men debating slavery as being anything other than what is was is akin to telling us how to vote or what religion to worship. In essence our views on race is ours to decide not theirs. They do not respect our right to decide our own creed and debate is another variance of telling us to obey they as if we are their slaves. It is racist itself. we have a right to free thought and they are violating our constitutional rights.<br><br>

         10. No means no. We will not permit mental rape and the gaslighting of our children that attempts to create slave mentality or blame us for our own victimization at their hands. Their every argument is intelluectual dishonsty marked by pathological lies and victim shaming.<br><br>

         11. We will demand full reparations or <strong>PERMANENTLY</strong> enagage in full economic and political warfare with them until they are decimated.<br><br>
         
         12. The first wave of abuse was slavery. The second Jim Crow and Racial Segregation. The third was Mass incarceration with 90% of inmates for non-violent drug crimes initiated by their governments War on Drugs and CIA putting Crack Cocaine on the streets. The fourth wave was internet memes and hiding behind troll internet accounts with psuedo logic and sophistry. They are a shell of their former self and will never return to power. Every decade they lose power and influence. They are desperate to have some form of control over blacks. They are mad they lost their slaves. They are poor sports. This what they are reduced to. They have no economic or militant control over blacks anymore and are soon to be vanquished. They can only hope to "hurt feelings" but not deal any real damage. Truthfully they are defeated yet rely on media and distraction to hiude the fact. It is smoke and mirrors, an illusion. Using correct tactics from Malone Doctine all blacks stand a much stronger chance of ultimate victory and insulation from white abuse.<br><br>
         
         13. We will not show quarter. We will not settle for equality. Their actions are inferior to innocent blacks so they must be imprisoned, their assets seized, their ability to wage conflict neutralized, and their associations banned and labeled as terrorist organizations.
