      <p>No unity = no community available.</p>
    </section>
<p> You cannot spell community without unity. There was never any unity in the Black community. Or any other community fo rthat matter. My message is not Black people "need" unity. My message is that people can take control of their lives with their own two hands independent from the world or anyone.</p>

<p> You cannot claim there exists "community" yet "blacks need to come together and form unity". It is a contridiction. Either you are united or you are not. Claimingh community with claiming a lack of unity is hypocritical.   If people wanted unity they were free to offer assistance helping build this website. The response? Verbal abuse and personal attacks.
</p>

<p> You cannot claim the desire for self-reliance under Pan African values then claim nonsense like "unity" or "it takes a village...". Nobody needs anybody. The minute people belive that is the minute they let others control their destiny. Nobody is coming to help you or save you. You are all you have. You are also all you need.</p>


<p> I never ask people for support because to do so is foolish. I can fix my own problems. Most people are toxic and slow me down. Or worse are sellouts and directly oppose me while pretending to be loyal. This website sorts out who is real and who is fake with unheard of clarity.</p> 


<p> I will build the framework of this website and offer it as a working model for others. All my ideas work. If people are serious about Black unity they will help build this website. I do not care if they do or don't. They are the ones who claimed they wanted unity but do not volunteer when when opportunities for meaning unity exist. This is proof of duplicitness. 
</p>.


<p> This website is free. I use it as a learning experience to build websites that finance me. So whether any Black people prove loyalty by joining this website is moot. If no one joins I built a website that proved they were sellouts and became rich. The Black race has failed me and until they prove themselves to me I consider them COINTEL PRO agents. The same people that killed Malcolm X. Do not expect to hang "unity" over my head like a carrot when you offered no assistance and I do not need you, do not have any reason to trust you, and outperform you.   What skills do you have?  What skills are you willing to learn to liberate African Americans and be a credit to your nation?
</p>

<p> While others talk about nonsense (pration) I demonstrate what the assignment is. Blacks have the opportunity RIGHT NOW to change their political and economic status permanently in this country but they are taking a dive. I cannot be a part of that.
</p>

<p> Anyone who is not aligned with me cannot be guarenteed my security. Without loyalty pledged to me I refuse to offer any assistance or support any cause as they are guarenteed to be born out of corruption and anti-black. I know who is loyal or not. The last fair offer I gave was for sellouts to redeem themselves by performing community service by helping build this site. You had 2 weeks. That offer has expired.</p>
