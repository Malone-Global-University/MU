I want to work on lessons for war college.
I have a complete curriculum finished.
I have landing pages for all three tiers.
I have planned five modules per tier.
Here are the modules for the first tier:

Curriculum Breakdown
Module I: The Architecture of Control
Examine how governments, corporations, and culture shape human behavior and compliance.
Module II: Breaking Programming
Identify mental blocks, social conditioning, and internalized limits placed on you since birth.
Module III: Foundations of Sovereignty
Build self-discipline, clarity, and personal mission orientation.
Module IV: Strategic Literacy
Study basic political strategy, information asymmetry, and systems thinking.
Module V: Leadership Formation
Learn fundamentals of leading small groups, communicating with authority, and projecting stability.


When I click on a module it should take me to a page where I give given instruction, leuctures, insight, and end with practical assignments for the study to carry out to train and internalize core philosophies.

I want to begin with module I and write separate pages per lesson. Lessons should have navigation to the next lesson at the end. To start with Module I: The Architecture of Control I want to map power structures in modern American society and how they interact with my students.

"Authoritarianism happens in both systems; only democracy promises to stop."
"Whether the promise is trustworthy becomes the real political question."


My real point: Promises are worthless because there is no way to force alignment without violence. COurts can be stalled and operate as theater. Both China and America demand loyalty to the state or are viewed as subversive citizens and harrassed by police. In both systems blind loyalty equals security and dissent equals blacklisting. In China the emergency only ends when blind loyalty is agreed to which leads to rewards in the form of bribery through their "honor system". Similar mechanisms in America exist but under different structual forms despite end result the same. In both systems rebellion means punishment and suspenion of rights, apologizing to governemnt ends the temporary use of force and rights are returned, in both systems this is how it is regardless of "cosmetic legal structuring".
