Site Selection
Prior to choosing a location, AWS performs initial environmental and geographic assessments. Data center locations are carefully selected to mitigate environmental risks, such as flooding, extreme weather, and seismic activity. Our Availability Zones are built to be independent and physically separated from one another.
 

Redundancy
Data centers are designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels. In case of failure, automated processes move traffic away from the affected area. Core applications are deployed to an N+1 standard, so that in the event of a data center failure, there is sufficient capacity to enable traffic to be load-balanced to the remaining sites.
 

Availability
AWS has identified critical system components required to maintain the availability of our system and recover service in the event of outage. Critical system components are backed up across multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone is engineered to operate independently with high reliability. Availability Zones are connected to enable you to easily architect applications that automatically fail-over between Availability Zones without interruption. Highly resilient systems, and therefore service availability, is a function of the system design. Through the use of Availability Zones and data replication, AWS customers can achieve extremely short recovery time and recovery point objectives, as well as the highest levels of service availability.
 

Capacity Planning
AWS continuously monitors service usage to deploy infrastructure to support our availability commitments and requirements. AWS maintains a capacity planning model that assesses our infrastructure usage and demands at least monthly. This model supports planning of future demands and includes considerations such as information processing, telecommunications, and audit log storage.
 

Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

Business Continuity Plan
The AWS Business Continuity Plan outlines measures to avoid and lessen environmental disruptions. It includes operational details about steps to take before, during, and after an event. The Business Continuity Plan is supported by testing that includes simulations of different scenarios. During and after testing, AWS documents people and process performance, corrective actions, and lessons learned with the aim of continuous improvement.
 

Pandemic Response
AWS incorporates pandemic response policies and procedures into its disaster recovery planning to prepare to respond rapidly to infectious disease outbreak threats. Mitigation strategies include alternative staffing models to transfer critical processes to out-of-region resources, and activation of a crisis management plan to support critical business operations. Pandemic plans reference international health agencies and regulations, including points of contact for international agencies.
 

Physical Access

AWS data center physical security begins at the Perimeter Layer. This Layer includes a number of security features depending on the location, such as security guards, fencing, security feeds, intrusion detection technology, and other security measures. 

Missing alt text value
Protection Features
Safeguards at every layer.

Access is scrutinized
AWS restricts physical access to people who need to be at a location for a justified business reason. Employees and vendors who have a need to be present at a data center must first apply for access and provide a valid business justification. The request is reviewed by specially designated personnel, including an area access manager. If access is granted, it is revoked once necessary work is completed.

Entry is controlled and monitored
Entering the Perimeter Layer is a controlled process. we staff our entry gates with security officers and employ supervisors who monitor officers and visitors via security cameras. When approved Individuals are on site, they are given a badge that requires multi-factor authentication and limits access to pre-approved areas. 

AWS data center workers are scrutinized, too
AWS employees who routinely need access to a data center are given permissions to relevant areas of the faclllty based on job function. But their access is regularly scrutinized, too. Staff lists are routinely reviewed by an area access manager to ensure each employees authorization is still necessary. If an employee doesn't have an ongoing business need to be at a data center, they have to go through the visitor process. 

Monitoring for unauthorized entry
We are continuously watching for unauthorized entry on our property, using video surveillance, intrusion detection, and access log monitoring systems. Entrances are secured with devices that sound alarms If a door Is forced or held open. 

AWS Security Operations Centers monitors global security
AWS Security Operations Centers are located around the wortd and are responsible for monitoring, triaging, and executing security programs for our data centers. They oversee physical access management and intrusion detection response while also providing global, 24/7 support to the on-site data center security teams. In short, they support our security with continuous monitoring activities such as tracking access activities, revoking access permissions, and betng available to respond to and analyze a potential security incident. 


Infrastructure Layer
Securing workloads with redundant systems

Overview
The Infrastructure Layer is the data center building and the equipment and systems that keep it running. Components like back-up power equipment, the HVAC system, and fire suppression equipment are all part of the Infrastructure Layer. These devices and systems help protect servers and ultimately your data.

Layer-by-layer access review
Like other layers, access to the Infrastructure Layer Is restricted based on business need. By Implementing a layer-by-layer access review, the right to enter every layer Is not granted by default. Access to any particular layer Is only granted If there Is a specific need to access that specific layer.

Maintaining equipment is a part of regular operations
AWS teams run diagnostics on machines, networks, and backup equipment to ensure they’re in working order now and in an emergency. Routine maintenance checks on data center equipment and utilities are part of our regular operations.

Emergency-ready backup equipment
Water, power, telecommunications, and internet connectivity are designed with redundancy, so we can maintain continuous operations in an emergency. Electrical power systems are designed to be fully redundant so that in the event of a disruption, uninterruptible power supply units can be engaged for certain functions, while generators can provide backup power for the entire facility. People and systems monitor and control the temperature and humidity to prevent overheating, further reducing possible service outages.

High availability through multiple availability zones
Unlike other cloud providers, each AWS Region has multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone consists of one or more data centers, are physically separated from one another, and have redundant power and networking. Customers who care about high availability and performance of their applications can deploy applications across multiple Availability Zones in the same region for fault tolerance and low latency. Availability Zones are connected to each other with fast, private fiber-optic networking, enabling you to easily architect applications that automatically fail-over between Availability Zones without interruption.


Overview
The Data Layer is the most critical point of protection because it is the only area that holds customer data. Protection begins by restricting access and maintaining a separation of privilege for each layer.

Technology and people work together for added security
There are mandatory procedures to obtain authorization to enter the Data Layer. This includes review and approval of a person’s access application by authorized individuals. Meanwhile, threat and electronic intrusion detection systems monitor and automatically trigger alerts of identified threats or suspicious activity. For example, if a door is held or forced open an alarm is triggered. We deploy security cameras and retain footage in alignment with legal and compliance requirements.

Preventing physical and technological intrusion
Access points to server rooms are fortified with electronic control devices that require multi-factor authorization. We’re also prepared to prevent technological intrusion. AWS servers can warn employees of any attempts to remove data. In the unlikely event of a breach, the server is automatically disabled.

Servers and media receive exacting attention
Media storage devices used to store customer data are classified by AWS as Critical and treated accordingly, as high Impact, throughout their life-cycle. We have exacting standards on how to Install, service, and eventually destroy the deVlces when they are no longer useful. When a storage device has reached the end of Its useful life, AWS decommissions media using techniques detailed In NIST 800-88. Media that stored customer data Is not removed from AWS control until It has been securely decommissioned. 

Third-party auditors verify our procedures and systems
AWS Is audited by external auditors on more than 2,600 requirements throughout the year. When third-party auditors Inspect our data centers they do a deep dive to confirm we're following established rules needed to obtain our security certifications. Depending on the compliance program and Its requirements, external auditors may Interview AWS employees about how they handle and dispose of media. Auditors may also watch security camera feeds and observe entrances and hallways throughout a data center. And they often examine equipment such as our electronic access control devices and security cameras. 

Environmental Layer
Powering workloads with sustainable infrastructure

Overview
The Environmental Security Layer proactively prepares for potential natural disasters and environmental threats while prioritizing sustainability, offering customers a resilient, efficient, and eco-friendly infrastructure for their applications.

Protection Features
Maximizing operational resilience.

Prepared for the unexpected
AWS proactively prepares for potential environmental threats, like natural disasters and fire. Instailing automatic sensors and responsive equipment are two ways we safeguard our data centers. Water-detecting devices can alert employees to problems as automatic pumps work to remove liquid and prevent damage. Similarly, automatic fire detection and suppression equipment reduces risk and can notify AWS employees and firefighters of a problem. 

High availability through multiple availability zones
Unlike other cloud providers, each AWS Region has multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone consists of one or more data centers, are physically separ.ited from one another, and have redundant power and networking. Customers who care about high availability and performance of their applications can deploy applications across multiple Availability Zones In the same region for fault tolerance and low latency. Availability Zones are connected to each other with fast, private fiber-optic networking, enabling you to easily architect applications that automatically fail-over between Availability Zones without interruption.

Simulating disruptions & measuring our response
The AWS Business Continuity Plan Is an operations process guide outlining how to avoid and lessen disruptions due to natural disasters with detailed steps to take before, during, and after an event. To mitigate and prepare for the unexpected, AWS tests the Business Continuity Plan regularly with drills that simulate different scenarios. We document how our people and processes perform, then debrief on lessons learned and any corrective actions that may be needed to Improve our response rate. we are trained and ready to rebound from disruptions quickly, which includes a methodical recovery process to minimize further downtime due to errors. 

AWS commitment to sustainability
In addition to addressing environmental risks, we also invest and innovate to incorporate sustainability into our data center design to provide the efficient, resilient service our customers expect while minimizing our environmental footprint—and theirs. Amazon is committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and in 2023 Amazon matched all of the electricity consumed across our global operations—including our data centers—with 100% renewable energy. AWS is also focused on energy efficiency across all aspects of our infrastructure and has committed to return more water to communities than AWS uses in its direct operations by 2030, and is embracing circular economy principles reducing waste.  Research estimates AWS Infrastructure Is up to 4.1 times more efficient than on­-premises, and when workloads are optimized on AWS, the associated carbon footprint can be reduced by up to 99%.
