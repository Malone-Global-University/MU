What Is Video Conferencing?
Video conferencing allows people in different locations to communicate via video and audio. Today, teams use video conferencing—with its ability to capture nonverbal, visual cues—to make communication more interactive.

Video conferencing solutions include standalone video-capable phones, web cameras, and full-scale video conferencing applications. Video conferencing solutions are also available using dedicated cameras, control panels, and video teleconference rooms.

Why use video conferencing?
Video conferencing has grown in popularity in recent years for a few reasons:

Video conferencing removes distance barriers and improves communications between people

Video conferencing gives workers the flexibility to work from anywhere

Video quality has improved with better video compression and faster networks

What are challenges with video conferencing?
The challenge with video conferencing solutions is that the hardware can be unintuitive to use.  You might have to follow several steps to start a video conference, and it can result in a frustrating experience. Often, a technical expert is required to help.

In addition, traditional video conferencing systems are expensive to acquire, proprietary in nature, and may involve ongoing hardware maintenance and support costs.

Effective video conferencing solutions should be easy to use and easy to control. Attendees should be able to join video conferences from anywhere.
