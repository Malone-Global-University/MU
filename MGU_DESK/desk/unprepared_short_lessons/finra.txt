FINRA
FINRA regulates a critical part of the securities industry â€“ brokerage firms doing business with the public in the United States. FINRA takes in as much as 400 billion market events per day that are tracked, aggregated, and analyzed for the purpose of protecting investors.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extreme volatility in the U.S. securities markets, and since March we have seen market volumes increase by 2-3x. Our compute resources with AWS are automatically provisioned and can process a record peak and then shut down to nothing, without any human intervention. We automatically turn on and off up to 100,000 compute nodes in a single day. We would have been unable to handle this surge in volume within our on premises data center.
