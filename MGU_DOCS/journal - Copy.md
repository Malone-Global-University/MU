- Want folder structure documented visually
- Journal as a living blueprint of the site’s evolution
- Ability to cross-reference Journal entry → Git commit hash → Netlify deploy → Screenshot
- Ability to save and reuse code

Artifacts Created
- `MGU Journal.odt` (first entry)
- `0001-MGU-folder-has-logo.png`
- `0002-MGU-folder-is-empty.png`
- `0003-MGU-create-sub-folders.png`

Next Steps
- Create `index.html` scaffold at project root
- Decide baseline CSS structure
