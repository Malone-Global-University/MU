A suggested project folder structure for your webpage. This structure keeps all files organized, scalable, and production-friendly.

Best Practices for This Structure

Separation of Concerns

index.html handles structure and semantics.

styles/styles.css contains all CSS, with variables, modular components, grid layout, and dark mode.

scripts/scripts.js contains JS for theme toggles, collapsibles, lazy-loading, and responsive nav.

Assets Organization

assets/images/ for content images.

assets/icons/ for social icons or UI icons.

Keep filenames lowercase and hyphenated for consistency.

Service Worker & Manifest

sw.js at root for scope covering all pages.

manifest.json describes PWA metadata (name, icons, theme color, start URL).

Deployment Ready

Minify styles.css and scripts.js for production.

Use HTTPS and consider hosting on a CDN.

Keep docs/ for internal reference or future expansion.

Optional Enhancements

Subfolders for Pages: If you expand to multiple pages, create pages/ with individual HTML files. Keep shared components via includes or templating engines.

Build Tools: Consider using a bundler (Vite, Webpack, Parcel) for minification, caching, and asset management.

Version Control: Track changes using Git and deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

With this structure, you now have a fully modular, production-ready, and deployable website project — optimized for performance, accessibility, SEO, dark mode, interactivity, and offline support.
