<h2>Introduction to Webpage Design</h2>
<p>
Every webpage is built on a simple structure, and understanding this foundation is the first step in becoming fluent in HTML5.
</p><p>
A webpage is divided into three main sections:
</p><ol><li>
Head (&lthead&gt) – This is like the “backstage” of your page. It doesn’t display content directly, but it contains important information such as the title, stylesheets, scripts, and metadata.</li>
<li>
Body (&ltbody&gt) – This is the main stage where everything your visitors see comes to life. Text, images, navigation menus, articles, and multimedia all live inside the body.
</li><li>
Footer (&ltfooter&gt) – Found at the bottom of the page, the footer usually holds extra information like copyright notices, contact links, and legal details.
</li><li>
The diagram below shows how these three parts fit together in a typical webpage layout:
</li><li>
<img src="/images/it/head-body-footer.svg" alt="HTML5 page anatomy showing head, body, and footer" width="1000">
</li><p>
By learning how to structure these sections, you’ll be able to create webpages that are both organized and easy to maintain.</p>
