# Pre-Algebra Main Takeaways

## What is Pre-Algebra?
Pre-algebra is an advanced study of arithmetic designed to prepare you for learning algebra and other higher math. The main topics to study are:

- Variables
- Operations and their notation
- The use of the number line
- PEMDAS and order of operations
- Set Theory and set notation
- Properties, Laws, and Rules

## Variables
Variables are **letters used to represent unknown numbers**. They are one of the most important building blocks in algebra.

### Roles of Variables
1. **Placeholder for missing values**  
   Variables can stand in for a number that makes a statement or equation true.  

2. **Writing formulas**  
   Variables are used to create general rules and formulas that work for many numbers.

### Intuition: Understanding Variables
Think of variables as “mystery numbers.”

- **Example 1:**  
  *What is two plus four?*  
  We could write:  


2 + 4 = ?

The question mark is a placeholder for the unknown number.  

- **Example 2:**  
*What number plus 3 equals 7?*  


? + 3 = 7

Using arithmetic, we find that 4 + 3 = 7.  

In algebra, instead of using question marks, we use letters such as `x, y, a, b, c`.  



2 + 4 = x
6 = x


This process of rewriting a problem with simpler numbers is called **simplifying an equation**.  

- The final equation `6 = x` is called **solving for x**.  
- The number you find is called the **solution for x**.

---

### Checking Your Work
To verify that `x = 6` is correct, we use **substitution**:



Original equation: 2 + 4 = x
Substitute x: 2 + 4 = 6
Simplify: 6 = 6 ✅


If both sides match, the answer is correct. If not, there’s an error to fix.  

---

## Formulas
A **formula** is a general equation used to find answers to a group of related problems.  

- **Example: Area of a rectangle**  


A = b × h

- `b` = base  
- `h` = height  
- `A` = area  

**Problem:** Find the area of a garden that is 4 feet by 8 feet.



b × h = A
4 × 8 = A
32 = A


The garden’s area is **32 square feet**.  

> Note: In formulas, letters like `b, h, A` are variables because they can change depending on the problem.

## Variables, Constants, and Coefficients

| Term        | Definition | Example in `2x + 3` |
|------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Variable** | A letter that stands for a number | x |
| **Constant** | A fixed number that does not change | 3 |
| **Coefficient** | A number multiplied by a variable | 2 |

---

## Try It Yourself!

1. Solve for x:  


x + 8 = 20


2. Write a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle using `l` for length and `w` for width.  

3. Identify parts of this expression: `5n + 7`  
- Variable  
- Constant  
- Coefficient  

---

## Summary
- Variables are letters that represent unknown or changeable numbers.  
- They are used as placeholders or in formulas.  
- Solving equations often means **solving for a variable**.  
- Checking your work with **substitution** ensures your answers are correct.  
- Formulas use variables to describe patterns or solve many problems at once.
