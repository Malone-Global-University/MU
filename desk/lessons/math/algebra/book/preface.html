<p>
This book will cover all math from high school algebra to fourth year linear algebra. It will use mixed examples through out blending advanced concepts with foundational skills. It will start off will algebra then mix in calculus in the beginning with just enough geometry and trigonometry to cover all important topics necessary for passing assessment into a first year course at the university level. It also will cover the first two years of a masters degree. 
</p><p>
Since this is an exhaustive undertaking emphasis will be on building foundation through clear understanding of vocabulary and mathematical terms. All math with be cross linked as much as possible so that time can be spared and more ground covered. There will be thorough definition, illustrations, and processes shown for every operation in math. With an understanding of how to do math the idea is you will not actually have to due much. Will try to cover 4 years of high school math in one year and four years of college math in one year from a strong pure sense while also adding abstraction. Adding abstraction shows readers the order in which math progresses giving them early exposure. The more exposure they have the more likely they will seek advanced math or be able to create their own equations and formulas sooner. 
</p><p>
Formal logic and writing proofs will be covered. Early definitions will be given plainly so that children are not overwhelmed. I will try to breeze through each topic as fast as I can while leaving no question as to how I arrived at the logic I did. To bridge different math the early explanations are short so it does not interrupt the flow of instruction. I am putting many pieces of information that has been surmised from my own experience plus the internet and other books. If you feel you need more practice in a certain area buy a dedicated used  algebra or calculus book from a thrift store for less that $20 each.
</p><p>
In reality you do not need to spend time extraneously plodding over the same questions over and over. You need a concise view of all the mathematics and their relationship to each other. You will be able to create equations that explain your real life situations and be able to solve them will ever increasing sophistication. In addition you should gain confidence to explore other topics not covered in this book once you have completed it. See what math others are doing and you the internet to join their conversations and work on projects with them. Experiment with their formulas and write your own. 
</p><p>
There are two parts to math and they are the pure and the applied. Applied is the area that defines job skills and real life conditions. Pure is abstract in the sense that it only serves as a teaching model to give instruction on the legal operations that can be done within the confines of the agreed upon laws of math. Pure defines what math is and is not and applied is how you use it to enrich your life. Math as a tool is used to solve real world problems and if it is not doing that then it has failed its purpose and real for even being. Concepts will be introduced in a very nontraditional format but still achieve the same goal of teaching. With that being said here are things to consider: 
</p><p>
1.  I wrote this book for everyone regardless of skill or age. Only basic arithmetic skills like
 (+, -,ï‚´, Ã·)  are required. Most people have already learned these skills in 4th-6th grade so I do not want to rehash basics that far back. If kids are reading this book it will make clear subjects and terms that they are not likely to see until much later or might have missed. A kid reading this book will improve not only their math but all subjects they face in school as well as their personal life because of the strong logic that it will build in them. Even if the material is too advanced they benefit from having a well referenced book. It will prepare them for college and beyond.
</p><p>
2. This book is split into three parts. It is at once a formal textbook, a series of notes from an upperclassman, and a conversation with a peer. As it begins slow skip parts that you do not need to deal with. As it is conversational raise questions that you have and we can devise a solution together. There is no such thing as a perfect book and I worked hard to write this at consider cost of my own time and money. I wrote this book because my passion for this project and helping others outweighed any other goals in life that had I pursued I would have been better of financially and socially. I put priority into this project above my own needs so that others would not have to go through the trouble of trial and error doing google or you tube searches to get bits or pieces of information they were looking for. This book truly does replace others attempts and it does not come with a subscription or or other reoccurring costs. Once you own this book it is yours to keep forever and use not only for yourself but for your children and friends as well.		</p><p>

3. Definitions will get more rigorous but start casually for ease of use. They will not be vague however. Certain parts that are basic may have examples that seem to be overly lengthy taking up a page or more. I only do that so that all my constraints are met to keep in theme of the book. I can not assume what people know or their educational exposure outside this book. This is to be a self contained reference except for the glaring omission of problems to solve. When a problem is given it is dealt with in the most complete manner possible so multiple teaching points are given. 
</p><p>
Other books do not do this. There were points where I was tempted to follow more professional texts that stated the process, gave an example, and then stated process once more and was done. I take a more examined look that goes past giving clues and deconstructs a problem as much as I can until there are no unknowns left about it. I only go onto the next instruction when I am satisfied that I have nothing more to explore or prove. This actually cuts time required to learn because nothing is left hidden or unexplained that will lead to confusion or lack of understanding later. This tends to happen when changing course to course and book to book. There are gaps.
</p><p>
4.  Many books exist that teach the basics. I go beyond them by taking advanced concepts and making them easy to understand and then applying them in a real situation where applicable. By doing this I transition from textbook lecturer to enthusiastic individual willing to share his notes on a given subject or problem. This does away from the standard teacher student relationship by giving readers what an authoritative book won't, the clear approaches to process without quizing them or challenging them to find it.
</p><p>
5. The order of this book will be very simple algebra applied with higher level concepts like functions and Greek notation. I am not making easy problems harder, I am introducing higher concepts earlier using almost too easy problems. This let's readers see the full mechanics under the hood so they can move to any course work any where and know what to do. In this sense this is less a textbook but more a tutorial or how to  guide. 
</p><p>
6. After algebra I will show calculus and then linear algebra. After foundations and terminology is covered math will be used in a more direct sense. Students will be able to write their own formulas for over 189 real life problems. 
</p><p>
7. I give exhaustive explanations for every math word and sign that exists so there is no gaps in knowledge. This benefits kids and adults alike. If you can read English you can use this book. I write and speak at a university level without leaving readers behind. If you do not know a word look it up and not only get better math skills but reading and writing as well.
</p><p>
8. Outside of process there are also fun concepts introduced to make math interesting. While technically not required for success at math the history, language and anecdotes makes for a greater experience. 
</p><p>
9. Finally, the most advanced subjects are beyond the scope of this book. This is mostly for foundation building so that readers will be able to read the sequel to this book I plan on producing. These go beyond pure math into masters and doctorate degrees in engineering fields like electrical and programming as well as gravitational and quantum mechanics. These sciences are founded in math but also require specialized study of chemistry and other physics. I can not prime readers for that in one volume. I will touch on what I can but will need to split documents into separate volumes for portability and ease of use. I do not try to put all into one book and only combine the information I do for fear of it being separated and do not want that to happen.  
</p><p>


Look for the glossary of terms in the front of the book as well as having them fully covered through the text. 
I also included many reference tables and useful data sets that appear in the back and front for ease of use.
