Preface

This book will cover all math from high school algebra to fourth year linear algebra. It will use mixed examples through out blending advanced concepts with foundational skills. It will start off will algebra then mix in calculus in the beginning with just enough geometry and trigonometry to cover all important topics necessary for passing assessment into a first year course at the university level. It also will cover the first two years of a masters degree. 
 
Since this is an exhaustive undertaking emphasis will be on building foundation through clear understanding of vocabulary and mathematical terms. All math with be cross linked as much as possible so that time can be spared and more ground covered. There will be thorough definition, illustrations, and processes shown for every operation in math. With an understanding of how to do math the idea is you will not actually have to due much. Will try to cover 4 years of high school math in one year and four years of college math in one year from a strong pure sense while also adding abstraction. Adding abstraction shows readers the order in which math progresses giving them early exposure. The more exposure they have the more likely they will seek advanced math or be able to create their own equations and formulas sooner. 

Formal logic and writing proofs will be covered. Early definitions will be given plainly so that children are not overwhelmed. I will try to breeze through each topic as fast as I can while leaving no question as to how I arrived at the logic I did. To bridge different math the early explanations are short so it does not interrupt the flow of instruction. I am putting many pieces of information that has been surmised from my own experience plus the internet and other books. If you feel you need more practice in a certain area buy a dedicated used  algebra or calculus book from a thrift store for less that $20 each.

In reality you do not need to spend time extraneously plodding over the same questions over and over. You need a concise view of all the mathematics and their relationship to each other. You will be able to create equations that explain your real life situations and be able to solve them will ever increasing sophistication. In addition you should gain confidence to explore other topics not covered in this book once you have completed it. See what math others are doing and you the internet to join their conversations and work on projects with them. Experiment with their formulas and write your own. 

There are two parts to math and they are the pure and the applied. Applied is the area that defines job skills and real life conditions. Pure is abstract in the sense that it only serves as a teaching model to give instruction on the legal operations that can be done within the confines of the agreed upon laws of math. Pure defines what math is and is not and applied is how you use it to enrich your life. Math as a tool is used to solve real world problems and if it is not doing that then it has failed its purpose and real for even being. Concepts will be introduced in a very nontraditional format but still achieve the same goal of teaching. With that being said here are things to consider: 

1.  I wrote this book for everyone regardless of skill or age. Only basic arithmetic skills like
 (+, -,, ÷)  are required. Most people have already learned these skills in 4th-6th grade so I do not want to rehash basics that far back. If kids are reading this book it will make clear subjects and terms that they are not likely to see until much later or might have missed. A kid reading this book will improve not only their math but all subjects they face in school as well as their personal life because of the strong logic that it will build in them. Even if the material is too advanced they benefit from having a well referenced book. It will prepare them for college and beyond.

2. This book is split into three parts. It is at once a formal textbook, a series of notes from an upperclassman, and a conversation with a peer. As it begins slow skip parts that you do not need to deal with. As it is conversational raise questions that you have and we can devise a solution together. There is no such thing as a perfect book and I worked hard to write this at consider cost of my own time and money. I wrote this book because my passion for this project and helping others outweighed any other goals in life that had I pursued I would have been better of financially and socially. I put priority into this project above my own needs so that others would not have to go through the trouble of trial and error doing google or you tube searches to get bits or pieces of information they were looking for. This book truly does replace others attempts and it does not come with a subscription or or other reoccurring costs. Once you own this book it is yours to keep forever and use not only for yourself but for your children and friends as well.		

3. Definitions will get more rigorous but start casually for ease of use. They will not be vague however. Certain parts that are basic may have examples that seem to be overly lengthy taking up a page or more. I only do that so that all my constraints are met to keep in theme of the book. I can not assume what people know or their educational exposure outside this book. This is to be a self contained reference except for the glaring omission of problems to solve. When a problem is given it is dealt with in the most complete manner possible so multiple teaching points are given. 

Other books do not do this. There were points where I was tempted to follow more professional texts that stated the process, gave an example, and then stated process once more and was done. I take a more examined look that goes past giving clues and deconstructs a problem as much as I can until there are no unknowns left about it. I only go onto the next instruction when I am satisfied that I have nothing more to explore or prove. This actually cuts time required to learn because nothing is left hidden or unexplained that will lead to confusion or lack of understanding later. This tends to happen when changing course to course and book to book. There are gaps.

4.  Many books exist that teach the basics. I go beyond them by taking advanced concepts and making them easy to understand and then applying them in a real situation where applicable. By doing this I transition from textbook lecturer to enthusiastic individual willing to share his notes on a given subject or problem. This does away from the standard teacher student relationship by giving readers what an authoritative book won't, the clear approaches to process without quizing them or challenging them to find it.

5. The order of this book will be very simple algebra applied with higher level concepts like functions and Greek notation. I am not making easy problems harder, I am introducing higher concepts earlier using almost too easy problems. This let's readers see the full mechanics under the hood so they can move to any course work any where and know what to do. In this sense this is less a textbook but more a tutorial or how to  guide. 

6. After algebra I will show calculus and then linear algebra. After foundations and terminology is covered math will be used in a more direct sense. Students will be able to write their own formulas for over 189 real life problems. 

7. I give exhaustive explanations for every math word and sign that exists so there is no gaps in knowledge. This benefits kids and adults alike. If you can read English you can use this book. I write and speak at a university level without leaving readers behind. If you do not know a word look it up and not only get better math skills but reading and writing as well.

8. Outside of process there are also fun concepts introduced to make math interesting. While technically not required for success at math the history, language and anecdotes makes for a greater experience. 

9. Finally, the most advanced subjects are beyond the scope of this book. This is mostly for foundation building so that readers will be able to read the sequel to this book I plan on producing. These go beyond pure math into masters and doctorate degrees in engineering fields like electrical and programming as well as gravitational and quantum mechanics. These sciences are founded in math but also require specialized study of chemistry and other physics. I can not prime readers for that in one volume. I will touch on what I can but will need to split documents into separate volumes for portability and ease of use. I do not try to put all into one book and only combine the information I do for fear of it being separated and do not want that to happen.  



Look for the glossary of terms in the front of the book as well as having them fully covered through the text. 
I also included many reference tables and useful data sets that appear in the back and front for ease of use.

This preface is already strong — it clearly communicates your vision, passion, and the unique approach of Malone Algebra. I can see that you’re aiming to make a “total math reference” that’s both approachable and ambitious.

If you’d like, I can help refine it so it feels a little tighter and more polished while keeping your voice. For example:

Clarity and flow: Some sentences can be streamlined for easier reading without losing depth.

Consistency: Phrases like “will” vs. “shall,” or “will not actually have to due much” (typo: do), can be standardized.

Structure: The numbered list is great, but it could benefit from smoother transitions and slightly shorter points.

Tone balance: Keeping your conversational tone while also ensuring it still reads professionally.

Would you like me to give you a light edit (clean up grammar/typos only) or a deep edit (restructure for maximum readability while preserving your personal style)?

You said:
yes

Great — I’ll give you a deep edit that tightens up the grammar, flow, and structure while keeping your conversational tone and passion intact. Here’s a revised version of your Preface:

Preface

This book covers mathematics from high school algebra through fourth-year linear algebra. It blends foundational skills with advanced concepts, moving quickly while keeping explanations clear. We begin with algebra, introduce calculus early, and bring in just enough geometry and trigonometry to cover all essential topics. The goal is to prepare you not only for university placement exams but also for advanced study—up to the equivalent of a master’s level foundation.

Because this is an ambitious undertaking, emphasis is placed on building strong foundations through precise definitions, vocabulary, and cross-linked concepts. Rather than isolating topics, I weave them together so that you see mathematics as one connected whole. Every operation is thoroughly explained with definitions, illustrations, and step-by-step processes. The more you understand how math works, the less you will have to memorize or struggle with later.

My goal is to compress time: four years of high school math in one year, four years of undergraduate math in another—while also introducing abstraction. Exposure to advanced concepts early gives you a sense of how mathematics progresses and encourages creativity in building your own formulas and methods.

Formal logic and proof-writing will be included, but early definitions are written plainly so even younger readers are not overwhelmed. Explanations are intentionally short at first to preserve flow, then gradually grow in rigor. The book is based on my own experience, research, and synthesis of countless resources. If you ever feel you need more practice, I encourage you to pick up a used algebra or calculus book as a supplement—but my intention is to give you a self-contained reference.

In truth, you do not need endless repetition of the same problem. What you need is a clear overview of the mathematics and their relationships to each other. This book will equip you to create equations for real-life situations and solve them with increasing sophistication. You will also gain confidence to explore mathematics beyond this volume, engage with others online, and even contribute your own ideas.

Mathematics has two sides: pure and applied. Pure math defines the rules and logical framework; applied math uses those rules to solve real-world problems. If math is not enriching your life or helping solve problems, it has failed its purpose. Here, concepts are presented in a nontraditional but practical way, always with an eye toward usefulness.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

Audience – I wrote this book for everyone, regardless of age or skill level. Only basic arithmetic (+, −, ×, ÷) is assumed. Younger readers will encounter terms earlier than usual, giving them a head start. Adults will find gaps in their knowledge filled. Even if some material feels advanced, the book remains a valuable reference that prepares you for college and beyond.

Format – This book is part formal textbook, part upperclassman’s notes, and part conversation with a peer. Skip what you already know, pause where you need more clarity, and treat it like a guided dialogue. I wrote this at significant personal cost of time and resources because I believe access to complete, clear math instruction should not require endless subscriptions or piecemeal internet searches.

Style of Explanation – Definitions begin casually, then grow in rigor. Examples are sometimes long—not to waste time, but to ensure every step is illuminated. I refuse to leave gaps that might cause confusion later, especially when moving from one course or resource to another.

Beyond Basics – Many books stop at fundamentals. I take advanced concepts and make them understandable, then show how they apply to real-world situations. Instead of a detached teacher-student tone, I write as someone eager to share insights and clear approaches.

Order – We start with simple algebra and quickly incorporate higher-level concepts like functions and Greek notation. The problems are intentionally easy, so that the focus is on understanding the machinery behind the math. This allows you to walk into any course and recognize what to do.

Progression – After algebra, we move into calculus and then linear algebra. Once terminology and foundations are in place, math is applied directly to nearly 200 real-world problems.

Language – Every math term and symbol is explained thoroughly. If you can read English, you can use this book. Along the way, your reading and writing skills will improve alongside your math.

Enrichment – History, anecdotes, and side concepts are sprinkled in to make learning engaging, even when they aren’t strictly necessary for solving problems.

Scope – The most advanced fields are beyond this single volume. This book focuses on building foundations so that you can later approach engineering, physics, and other advanced sciences. A sequel will take on those challenges.

You’ll also find glossaries, reference tables, and data sets placed at the front and back of the book for convenience.

Would you like me to also restructure this into a more "professional textbook preface" style (like you’d see in something from Springer or Pearson), or do you prefer to keep the hybrid conversational tone you already have?

Math Vocabulary and Concepts


Pre-calculus (also known as trigonometry which is algebra/geometry/trigonometry combined):


1. Arithmetic- The study of adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, powering, and radicalizing. 

2. Algebra-  The study of balancing equations using variables to solve for an unknown quantity using variables, graphing and functions. It is arithmetic with variables (formulas). Calculus without derivatives.

4. Trigonometry- The study of right angles and their measure. Using trig functions to find unknown
angles or distances. 

5. Statistics- The study of odds and probability. This leads into further number theory.


Advanced math:


1. Calculus- The study of rates of change using formulas for slope such as (y2 -y1) ÷ (x2 -x1). The two parts are derivatives and integration finding slope of a curved function and taking the area under that curve.

2. Linear algebra- Studying higher level linear equations using matrices, determinants, and Gaussian elimination. Focuses on moving through vector spaces using multi dimensional plane geometry.  Also called vector algebra or tensor calculus to use matrices and arrays as tables to list numbers.

7. Combinatorics – Set theory with application for computer algorithms.

8. Topology- Algorithms using ordered data in a set theory environment.






Glossary


Variable: Letter used to symbolize unspecified numbers. Used in algebra. If x-1 =7 then x =8. Since x can be anything it varies depending on the numbers around it. It is called variable because it varies, the opposite of constants like 1 or 7 which do not vary, they have constant value.


Algebraic expression:  Using letters as variables in equations. An expression is a sum written without an equation sign. An equation has an equals sign like 2+2 = 4 while an expression is 2+2. If we use algebra then 2x – 1 = 4 simply writing “2x – 1” would be an expression.


Factors: Numbers used to form a product. If 2∙3 =6 then 2 and 3 are factors of 6.


Product: Result of numbers multiplied.


Raised dot: This symbol · used for multiplication. Has seven other names including interpunct. 


Obelus: This symbol ÷ used for division. Also called multiplication sign. We just use forward slash /.


Fraction bar: The line between two numbers to indicate a fractional sum such as this ⅓ . Can also be horizontal but that is mostly used for solving equations as a fill in for an obelus since fractions are the quotient of division. Forward slash can be used in place of a horizontal bar if a computer does not have access to it.   Alt 0188= ¼   alt 0189= ½  alt 0190= ¾. 


Quotient: The resulting number from a division operation. The dividend is operated on by the divisor resulting in a quotient. 100 divided by 4 equals 25. 100 is the dividend, 4 is the divisor, 25 is the quotient.


Ratio: A ratio is sometimes but not always a fraction comparing two amounts. In chemistry and science we call this a solution or a proportion. Ratios tell either the amount of different elements added to each other at what rate or the rate at which something is changing. Ratios are written using a colon as 10:1 properly and spoke,” Ten to one”. This differs from writing them as a fraction since in this case we want to know the two quantities being compared. Using both numbers tells us that one element is 10x greater than the other. A ratio given as a fraction would entice us to simply the fraction or write it as a decimal. The ratio 3:2 becomes 1.5, causing the second element to be lost and only the first one remaining. Context of subject matter determines whether we want to keep information or not however colon formula is often preferential.


Base: The number to be expanded using exponents. 107 has 10 as the base and 7 as the exponent, or power.
Power: Another name for exponent. 22  is “2 squared”, 23 is “2 cubed”, 24  is “2 to the fourth, 2 raised to a power of four, 2 expanded to a power of four”. Raising to a power of 2 is called squaring it, raising to a power of 3 is cubing, raising to 4 and beyond is raising to a power of.

Squared: Any number times itself is said to be squared. 2·2=4 4 is the square of 2.


Cubed: Any number raised to a power of three is cubed. 27 is the cube of 3. A base times itself twice. 33= 27.


Raised to a power of: Taking a base and raising it to a power of 4 or higher. See previous example of “power”.


Gross: 122= 144. This is called a “gross”.


Great gross: 123=1728


Volume: The amount of space inside a three dimensional shape serving as a container for some medium such as air or liquid. Used to measure the size of something using mathematical constants. Formula is lwh= volume when l= length, w= width and h= height. Used in geometry and related fields.


Area: The space occupying a two dimensional plane measured by multiplying length by width. Formula is given as lw= area when l= length and w= width. Used in geometry and related fields.

½ 
Formula for perimeter: The length of the borders of a two dimensional shape or plane. 
			  Formula varies based on the number of sides a two dimensional plane has. 


1. Triangle         = x+y+z. 		Measure all three sides and add.
2. Square            = 4x. 			Measure one side and multiply by 4.
3. Parallelogram = 2(x+y). 		Measure sides then distribute out and add.
4. Trapezoid        = x+2y+z. 		Measure sides then add.

5. Circle= dπ.     				Multiply diameter by π or multiply radius by 2 and them multiply by pi. 						Also called circumference.
6. Oval track= πh+2l. 			Circumference of circle plus perimeter of rectangle.


Example using 60 for height and 120 for length, round to appropriate number of digits:
Perimeter of track:       π·60+2(120) 	→	π60+240 → 	188.49+240	→	 428.496 meters


7. πr2. Measure the widest part of the circle to find the diameter then divide it in half to find the radius. Take the radius and square it then multiply by π.


For entire area of track:      lw+ πr2 	→	60·120+ π302	→	7200+π900	→ ≈ 10,027.43 
You only have to find area of the whole circle not two individual halves, (area of rectangle +area of circle).


Operators/Operations: There are six operators + – ÷ ∙ ^ √ used to perform arithmetic. 


Operators are the symbols used to indicate the operation to be performed. Operations the method of increasing or decreasing a quantity or number. Operation signs are called addition (+), subtraction (-), times or multiply (×  or ·), divide (÷), power (^ or write as exponents using superscripts), and radical (√). 


There are six main operations, each corresponding to it's own unique symbol telling how to proceed with determining a solution to a given problem. More symbols can and do exist for the same operations so there is some redundancy. These other symbols exist as a convenience so that they make reading an equation easier to do. Often the (×) is replaced in algebra with the center dot (·) so that the × sign is not confused with the variable “x”.


Most if not all math symbols (called operator signs or math signs) come from earlier and archaic sources. Many times these symbols have been repurposed for many different uses. They have variant sizing, patterns, and different names. Sometimes there are different names for the different versions. Mostly used for annotating literature these older names and versions are not likely appropriate for math or proofreading anymore. They are obsolete and many people would not understand them or their purpose making them only acceptable for private use and not public consumption. You are not expected to know these or learn them. You are however expected to learn the Greek letters and symbols commonly used in math, physics, and engineering. Using archaic and obsolete symbolism will make notes messier and hard to read so their use is discouraged. In addition to learning math operators and signs it is also useful to learn keyboard shortcuts to put them in computer text software programs. These signs do not appear on modern keyboards so you but to insert them using alt shortcuts. Alt shortcuts only work on keyboards with a 10 key numerical pad so you need to invest in one if you want to be productive. Learning to insert them onto your documents and websites is handy. They can even be used in search bars and comments. To embed them in a webpage you have to use html codes and they are different but same idea as alt shortcuts. Warning: Some courses have different meanings for use!


Statement: A line of text or something said giving some description to the conditions of the facts at hand. We use these facts to form our equations so that we can solve them. Statements are often used in word problems when explaining the equation in written English rather than using algebraic expressions. Note however that algebraic expressions and equations themselves are forms of statements as well. In closing a statement must be true or false but not both.


Open sentences: Mathematical expressions containing variables whether written in script or as an equation that must be solved before you know if the statement it is making is true or false.


Solution: A solution is a number that solves our equation.


Solving the open sentence: When we replace variables with numbers the sentence is said to be solved.




Equation:  Equations are expressions containing an equals sign. If it has an equal sign it is an equation. A set or string of terms with operations that requires working to derive a solution. In Algebra equations are balanced so that two sides, a left and right, or separated by an equation sign (=). To keep the equation true you have to perform equal actions on either side or your equation will become unbalanced and therefore false.


Set:  Sets group numbers or objects together so that they are listed using parentheses to differentiate them from other data. Using parentheses like this is called set notation and is mainly a study of set theory. Set theory uses an elongated version (∈ ) of the Greek letter epsilon (ε) to denote members of a set. Members of a set are also called elements. This is used in computer science for object orientated programming (oop), writing strings, arrays, and other places where programming code deals with nested items. Sets also show up in algebra when dealing with simple linear equations and plotting coordinates on a linear graph. Groups of points, called ordered pairs [(0,1)], can be collected and placed inside set notation to display what valves are relevant or appearing for a given function or chart.


For example if we have the points (0,1), (1,2), (2,3),(…), we would nest them like  {(0,1); (1,2); (2,3);(...)}. The ε means that each pair is a “member” of this set.  

Sets are also used in number theory and many other places in math. In spreadsheets the Greek letter sigma (Σ) is used to add. We call this summation or the summing of values inside the nested parentheticals. For example if we had Σ={1,2,3,} it would read as “the summation of {1,2,3,}” and that means that we add and get “6”.  Whether actually adding or just knowing that the values inside are to be treated as a singular value this is how sigma is used.


Greek letters vary in meaning from branch of one mathematics to another. Uppercase epsilon looks just like the English letter E. To avoid confusion exaggerated versions are used to illustrate the meaning better. This is why ∈  is used instead of E or the regular Greek letters. Uppercase epsilon is usually for elements of a set and lower case epsilon (ε) is for denoting a small quantity. There are many uses for the Greek letters and I have included as many of them and their alt codes that I know but sometimes there will be contradictions in terms so you will have to substitute whatever you can and just improvise. If you are using eccentric notation that a reader is likely to be unfamiliar with make that clear before using ambiguous terms. It really only matters that you and your intended audience can understand what notation you are using not anybody else.


Subset: A set with a set. Infinity (∞) is the set of all numbers. All even numbers are a subset of ∞. All even numbers ending with zero are a subset of that set. All even numbers ending with zero under 100 are a deeper nested subset still. A subset would be a level below a superset. 


For example: ∈ {+∞ (2,4,6...(10,20,30...100,110,120...(10,20...90)))}. 


This shows that within positive infinity (as denoted by the +) a subset exists that contains the set of infinite positive even numbers (as denoted by the ellipsis (…)). Then exists all positive even tens, finally there exists a set of even tens that ends at 90.  


Superset: A set containing subsets. A superset would be a level above a subset. 
Null: Ø. This means that a set contains no numbers. ∈ {Ø} means that there are no numbers in this set, not even zero as a placeholder. Literally {} instead of {0}. If null then does not exist abbreviated as dne. Difference between null and zero is if a function mapped 0,1,2 to elements a,b,c then 0 = a; if f(x) ≠ a, b, or c then f(x) ≠ null. Null is like saying n/a for not applicable meaning you exceeded a domain causing a null status.


If selecting items from menu required ordering #0, #1, or #2 then  Ø set is no selection at all.
A = apple= 0	B = banana = 1     C = cherries = 2
f(0) = apple	f(1) = banana	f(2) = cherries	f() = Ø nothing.


Empty set: A set with no elements is called empty or null.


Replacement set: The solution to an open sentence occurs when all variables have been accounted for using numerals. The replacement set for the variables is the solution to the expression. In factoring polynomials you often use replacement sets to find the factors that make up a trinomial.


Negation: Negation means reversing an operation or taking the opposite of something. Subtraction negates or is the negation of addition. By multiplying by a -1 we can negate terms of equations (indeed the entire equation itself) to be the opposite of sign of what it already is. This is useful simplifying and reducing equations to make them cleaner looking or easier to solve.


Properties: Properties are rules that dictate how order of operations should behave and what is permissible when reordering terms to restructure an equation. Properties show how the numbers behave and interact with each other on a foundational level as opposed to simply solving for an answer. Understanding and having innate sense of properties shows an advanced mastery of mathematics and goes beyond superficial plugging in of values to get a result. You know how the numbers behave conceptually rather then mechanically.


Additive identity property: For any number a,  a+0 = a. This states that 0 does not change the value.


Multiplicative identity property: For any number a, a·1 = 1·a. 


Multiplicative property of zero:  For any number a, a·0 = 0·a. This states that the order of terms is irrelevant and moving them around does not change the answer. [In addition any number times zero is zero. Further diving by zero is undefined. It is undefined since dividing by zero does not give us non zero factor.


Additive inverse: The number of the same numerical value but opposite quality value. Two additive inverses sum to zero.  


Multiplicative inverse: The reciprocal of a number or function. The product of two reciprocals is 1. Ex. ⅕∙5 = 1.


Properties of equality: The following properties are true for any a, b, or c. 


Reflexive:  a = a
Symmetric: if a = b then b = a. This just restates commutation law or uses double substitution.
Transitive: if a = b and b = c then a = c.
Substitutive: if a = b then a may be replaced by b. 


Distributive property: For any numbers a, b, c:


a (b + c) = ab + ac   and    (b + c) a = ba + ca 
a (b – c) = ab –  bc   and    (b – c) a = ba – ca     

To remove parenthetical terms you must use multiplication by the factor outside the parentheses, in this case “a”. If there is no factor then multiply by “1” to cancel the parentheses. If there is a minus sign infront of the parenthetical then you must multiply every term inside by –1. This inverts all signs of the terms (sign flipping) changing them to there additive inverses: 5(x+2) = 5x+10 	–5(x+2) = –5x – 2     –(5x+3x–4) becomes –5x–3x+4.

Commutative property:  This states that the order of terms is irrelevant and moving them around does not change the answer for addition and multiplication. 2∙3÷4 is same as 3∙2÷4 , 2∙¾ , 3∙ 2/4.   


Associative property: For any numbers a, b, c (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (ab) c = a (bc). It says that if you change the grouping for + or ÷ the result is the same.


Term: Is a number, variable, product, quotient, or mixed number. Terms are the groups of numbers separated by operands. Each term may be composed of multiple parts but is considered a single value. A trinomial has three terms each separated by a plus or minus sign.


Simplest form: An expression without like terms or parentheses. The final answer when solving equations.


Like terms: Terms that contain the same variables raised to the same power. 5x2 and 4x2  are like terms but 2x3 and 5x are not. 5xy5z and y5xz are like but 5x5yz and 5xy5z2  are not. 


Coefficient: The numeral factor in a mixed number. In 5x the coefficient is 5 because it is a constant number.    


Constant:  A number that is not a variable. Numbers 0-9 are constants because they are not alphabetic. In 5x the coefficient 5 is the constant and x is the variable. All variables have letters to denote their changing values. All constants except transcendentals have numerals  to denote their value is always the same. Some constants like Euler's number “ e ”, the imaginary number “ i ”, and π use letters to represent their value but this is because they are very long and only used as a convenience. They are considered constants because their value is known and it does not change. The difference between a variable and a constant is 5 is constantly 5 while x varies.

Pi: The mathematical constant approximated by 3.141592 or 22/7 or 355/113 to denote the symbol π.  Pi is used to calculate circumference and area of circles using the formulas dπ for circumference and πr2  for area. There are different approximations for pi but the symbol always remains the same.  


Domain: The set containing x values of a graph. What choices exist for x as an input for a function.


Range: The set containing x values of a graph. What choices exist for x as an output for a function.


Graph: The line or curve of a set of plotted points on a piece of graph paper. Literally the image itself.


Function: A ratio of x:y used to write equations in graph form. Written as f(x) = equation.


Inverse function: The graph of a function that has inverted (swapped) x and y values. Written as f-1(x) = equation.


Slope: The tangent ratio of a line given by the formula M= y2 – y1/x2 – x1. Slope is how angled a line is to the x-axis. The formula simplifies to M = y/x. The M is chosen because it looks like a mountain slope making it easier to recognize. Tangent is a trig function that is the height of a triangle divided by it's base. Tangent =M =sine/cosine.

Linear Equation: A line graph given by the formula y = Mx+b. This is heavily used in algebra and beyond.


Quadratic Equation: A parabola graph. Quadratics are second degree polynomials while lines are 1 degree.


Cubic Equation: A graph having 3 degrees. Think of phase “giving someone the third degree”. 


Cartesian grid: A sheet of graph paper with numbered lines called axes for plotting points. Any rectangular grid for graphing.

x-axis: The horizontal number line in a rectangular coordinate system.


y-axis: The vertical number line in a rectangular coordinate system.


x-value: The horizontal distance from the y-axis. This is the x in an ordered pair (x,y).


y-value: The vertical distance from the x-axis. This is the y in an ordered pair (x,y).

Coordinate: The location of a point given by distance from the origin of two axes. Pronounced “ax ease”Axes is plural of axis. Also called “ordered pairs”.

Point: In geometry a location having zero area. A point is given by an ordered pair (x,y) using x and y values or (x,y,z) using x,y, and z values.


In arguments a point is a logical conclusion. Two or more points that co-linear creates a “line of thought”. 
If points are not colinear then the person is “going off on a tangent”. A tangent line touches another line forming a 90° vertex so that a tangent is going off track from the original direction at the fastest rate possible (∞). If two lines of thought intersect at a vertex that point called the “solution” to a “system of equations”. In conflict two opposing lines of thought that intersect have a solution that represents compromise both parties can and will agree to. A parabola is a curved line forming an elliptical vertex given x2. There are different symbolic interpretations but either building a base for your case using x2 to represent area in 2 dimensions or approaching a problem from two different angles which share symmetry and meet at the vertex as a conclusion. The former is easy to apply the latter represents teamwork or independently coming to the same conclusion from different points or using proof to confirm a suspected idea. A cubic is 3d so is a solid block of evidence. Giving someone the third degree involves invasive questioning to gather as much evidence as possible. Depending on the quantity and quality of the evidence a verdict is reached. Side note a vertex represents a corner of 90° – θ where theta can be 0°<θ<90°. 


Verdict and vertex share Latin roots. Ver-dict is “90° diction” of a decision meaning two points of view of complete opposite rotation meet at a single conclusion: yes or no, guilty or innocent. Start at the meeting point and work backwards. You have two rays forming a 90° angle and extend to – ∞ for x and ∞ for y. These are complete opposite axes at there furthest points, one a positive and the other a negative corresponding to yes~innocent or no~guilty. Ver-tex is lesser important but refers to the crossing of lines to make letters of the alphabet stemming from Phoenician cuneiform the precursor to Latin. Versed is 90° and tex is text meaning writing as in context which means “with text” or the other writing that goes with previous writing to explain it. Context is always the definition as it defines or illustrates the picture,  which is a graph made from points. On a different note a song has “verses” which is “rounds” of singing representing a rotation in degrees from end of line to end of line making an arc angle till angles added to 360°, the Greeks represented music mathematically in their cults, too much to surmise here. Note here is a double ontaundre (french for tangent because I am going off on a tangent completely changing points) because note can refer to music or prose) Compare verses with the homophone versus. Verses means lyrics referring to bullion writing which turns and twists down the page and versus is two competing objects, in math versus is the battle between the ratio x:y of a function. Ratios rotate like gear ratios or credit/debit ratios i.e. revolving credit and capitalizing versus expensing.)     Explore more subjects like foreign language, engineering, music theory, and finance.

You have a “overturned verdict” which is a complex rotation of degree 4 meaning an inverse function where x and y are swapped making no~guilty becomes yes~innocent and vise versa. A “snap verdict” where a line of thought P1→P2→P4 = A→B→D where you have a hole in your argument at point C. Holes in your argument (also called logic) are gaps or leaps of faith that lead to illogical rational and bad policy. Of course a hole in a function is given by dividing by 0 creating a domain error at that point. There are many other figures of speech using verdict that are logical in directly mathematical way because that is how legal terminology
originated.     


Compare with “sur” which means to cover as in a surjective function (many-to-one). Verse is to turn sur is to cover, as in surreptitiously (cover a topic exhaustively).

This is a massive and rich draft—you’re clearly building a full “math vocabulary + concepts reference” that doubles as a teaching text. It’s got good coverage, but right now it’s a bit overwhelming: lots of dense paragraphs, some repetition, and a mix of formal definitions with side tangents, jokes, and etymology.

I see three possible directions depending on your goal:

Textbook Reference Style – Concise, clean definitions with minimal commentary (so students can quickly look things up).

Teaching Companion Style – Keep the conversational tone, examples, and side explanations, but organize them with headings, bullets, and “notes” so they don’t blur together.

Hybrid Style – A reference that reads like a teaching dialogue, blending precise definitions with your digressions and history notes, but clearly separated so the reader knows what is “core” vs. “extra.”

Some immediate suggestions for structure and clarity:

Break it into sections (Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Functions, Sets, Properties, Graphing, etc.). Right now everything runs into each other.

Use definition boxes or bold key terms at the start of each entry (e.g., Variable: …). You’ve started this with the glossary, but it should be consistent throughout.

Separate core definition vs. commentary. For example:

Core: A variable is a letter used to represent an unknown value that can change depending on context.

Extra note: It’s called a variable because it “varies,” unlike constants such as 7, which do not change.

Where you go into philosophical or etymological tangents (like verdict/vertex, verses/versus), mark them as “Note” or “Historical aside.” That way they enrich the reading without confusing a student who just wants the math.

Fix some small accuracy points:

Statistics is not just “odds and probability”—it’s also about collecting, organizing, and analyzing data.

Number theory is not statistics—it’s the study of properties of integers. (Bayesian methods are probability/statistics, not number theory.)

Lambda calculus is more computer science than mainstream math, so you might want to frame it as “an advanced abstract system that influenced programming.”

If you’d like, I can reorganize this whole draft into a structured glossary + concept reference with:

Main definitions (short, precise)

Examples (step-by-step)

Notes/sidebars (history, philosophy, fun connections like verdict/vertex)

Would you like me to try reorganizing it in that way so you get a clean, publishable structure while keeping all your content?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 That’s exactly what I was hoping you’d say. Here’s how I’ll reorganize your draft into a structured reference + teaching companion:

Malone Algebra — Glossary & Foundations

Each entry will follow this format:

Term (bold): Short, precise definition.

Example: A simple worked-out case.

Note / Sidebar: History, philosophy, wordplay, or etymology (optional, marked separately).

Example Reformat (from your draft)

Variable: A letter or symbol that represents an unknown value which can change depending on context.

Example: In the equation 
𝑥
+
5
=
9
x+5=9, the variable is 
𝑥
x. Solving gives 
𝑥
=
4
x=4.

Note: Called a variable because it can “vary.” In contrast, constants like 
7
7 never change.

Constant: A fixed value that does not change.

Example: In 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
7
y=2x+7, the number 
7
7 is a constant.

Note: Constants are the “anchors” of equations—unchanging values that define conditions.

Equation: A statement showing two expressions are equal, connected by an equals sign 
=
=.

Example: 
3
𝑥
+
2
=
11
3x+2=11. This can be solved to find 
𝑥
x.

Note: The word comes from aequare (Latin “to make equal”).

This way:

The main idea is clear and short (good for reference).

Examples ground the idea (good for students).

Notes carry your unique flavor—history, philosophy, and word connections—without overwhelming the main definition.

I can start by taking your first chunk (Arithmetic → Sets → Algebra basics) and rewriting it in this structured format so you can see how it flows.

👉 Do you want me to start with Arithmetic & Algebra Basics first, or with the Glossary of Terms (Variables, Constants, Equations, Functions, etc.)?

Arithmetic & Algebra Basics
ChatGPT said:

Got it ✅ Let’s take your draft and start reshaping Arithmetic & Algebra Basics into the structured reference + teaching companion style we discussed.

Arithmetic & Algebra Basics
Arithmetic

The branch of mathematics dealing with the basic operations of numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Example: 
7
+
3
=
10
7+3=10, 
9
−
4
=
5
9−4=5, 
6
×
8
=
48
6×8=48, 
20
÷
4
=
5
20÷4=5.

Note: These four operations are the foundation of all higher mathematics. Algebra, calculus, and beyond are essentially extensions and abstractions of these simple rules.

Algebra

A system of mathematics that uses letters and symbols (variables) to represent numbers and relationships. Algebra is about creating, manipulating, and solving equations.

Example: If 
𝑥
+
5
=
9
x+5=9, subtract 5 from both sides: 
𝑥
=
4
x=4.

Note: Algebra allows us to describe patterns, rules, and unknowns. It connects arithmetic with abstraction, letting us solve problems beyond simple computation.

Variable

A symbol, usually a letter, that represents a number whose value can change.

Example: In 
2
𝑥
+
3
=
9
2x+3=9, 
𝑥
x is the variable. Solving: 
2
𝑥
=
6
2x=6, so 
𝑥
=
3
x=3.

Note: Variables “vary.” They are placeholders until we define or calculate their value.

Constant

A fixed number that does not change.

Example: In 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
7
y=2x+7, the number 
7
7 is a constant.

Note: Constants anchor equations, giving them a stable reference.

Equation

A mathematical statement that two expressions are equal, connected by the symbol 
=
=.

Example: 
3
𝑥
+
2
=
11
3x+2=11. Solving gives 
3
𝑥
=
9
3x=9, then 
𝑥
=
3
x=3.

Note: The equals sign was first introduced in 1557 by Robert Recorde. He chose two parallel lines “because no two things can be more equal.”

Expression

A mathematical phrase made up of numbers, variables, and operations, but without an equals sign.

Example: 
4
𝑥
+
7
4x+7 is an expression.

Note: Expressions are like “incomplete thoughts.” Adding an equals sign turns an expression into an equation.

Order of Operations

The rules that tell us in what order to perform operations in an expression.

Rule: Parentheses → Exponents → Multiplication/Division → Addition/Subtraction (often remembered as PEMDAS).

Example: 
3
+
2
×
5
=
3
+
10
=
13
3+2×5=3+10=13 (not 25!).

Note: Following a consistent order ensures everyone gets the same result.

This gives you a tight, readable core (definition + example) plus room for your personality (notes, history, philosophy).

ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 Let’s keep building out the Arithmetic & Algebra Basics section in the same style. We left off at Order of Operations, so now we’ll move into Properties of Operations (commutative, associative, distributive, identity, inverse, etc.), then some foundational number concepts.

Arithmetic & Algebra Basics (continued)
Commutative Property

The order of addition or multiplication does not change the result.

Addition: 
𝑎
+
𝑏
=
𝑏
+
𝑎
a+b=b+a.

Multiplication: 
𝑎
×
𝑏
=
𝑏
×
𝑎
a×b=b×a.

Example: 
3
+
7
=
7
+
3
=
10
3+7=7+3=10. 
4
×
5
=
5
×
4
=
20
4×5=5×4=20.

Note: “Commutative” comes from commute (to move around). Subtraction and division are not commutative: 
8
−
3
≠
3
−
8
8−3

=3−8.

Associative Property

The way numbers are grouped (with parentheses) does not change the result for addition and multiplication.

Addition: 
(
𝑎
+
𝑏
)
+
𝑐
=
𝑎
+
(
𝑏
+
𝑐
)
(a+b)+c=a+(b+c).

Multiplication: 
(
𝑎
×
𝑏
)
×
𝑐
=
𝑎
×
(
𝑏
×
𝑐
)
(a×b)×c=a×(b×c).

Example: 
(
2
+
3
)
+
4
=
5
+
4
=
9
(2+3)+4=5+4=9. Also 
2
+
(
3
+
4
)
=
2
+
7
=
9
2+(3+4)=2+7=9.

Note: Subtraction and division are not associative.

Distributive Property

Multiplication distributes over addition or subtraction.

Rule: 
𝑎
(
𝑏
+
𝑐
)
=
𝑎
𝑏
+
𝑎
𝑐
a(b+c)=ab+ac.

Example: 
3
(
4
+
5
)
=
3
×
9
=
27
3(4+5)=3×9=27. Using distributive property: 
3
×
4
+
3
×
5
=
12
+
15
=
27
3×4+3×5=12+15=27.

Note: This property is a bridge between arithmetic and algebra—it lets us expand and simplify expressions.

Identity Property

Special numbers (called identities) leave other numbers unchanged when used in operations.

Addition Identity: 
𝑎
+
0
=
𝑎
a+0=a.

Multiplication Identity: 
𝑎
×
1
=
𝑎
a×1=a.

Example: 
6
+
0
=
6
6+0=6, 
9
×
1
=
9
9×1=9.

Note: Zero is the identity for addition; one is the identity for multiplication.

Inverse Property

Every number has an opposite (additive inverse) and, except zero, a reciprocal (multiplicative inverse).

Additive Inverse: 
𝑎
+
(
−
𝑎
)
=
0
a+(−a)=0.

Multiplicative Inverse: 
𝑎
×
1
𝑎
=
1
a×
a
1
	​

=1, for 
𝑎
≠
0
a


Example: The inverse of 
7
7 under addition is 
−
7
−7. The inverse of 
5
5 under multiplication is 
1
5
5
1
	​

.

Note: Inverses “undo” operations—this is the backbone of solving equations.

Numbers and Sets of Numbers

Numbers can be grouped into different sets depending on their properties.

Natural Numbers: 
1
,
2
,
3
,
…
1,2,3,… (counting numbers).

Whole Numbers: 
0
,

−
2

3
4
,
−
7
2
,
0.25
4
3
	​

,−
2
7
	​

,0.25).

Irrational Numbers: Numbers that cannot be written as fractions (e.g. 
𝜋
,
2
π,
2
	​

).

Real Numbers: All rational and irrational numbers combined.

Imaginary Numbers: Numbers involving 
𝑖
i, where 
𝑖
=
−
1
i=
−1
	​

.

Complex Numbers: Numbers of the form 
𝑎
+
𝑏
𝑖
a+bi with both real and imaginary parts.

Note: Each set “builds” on the previous one—natural numbers grow into whole numbers, then integers, rationals, and so on.

Absolute Value

The distance a number is from zero on the number line.

Definition: 
∣
𝑎
∣
=
𝑎
∣a∣=a if 
𝑎
≥
0
a≥0, and 
∣
𝑎
∣
=
−
𝑎
∣a∣=−a if 
𝑎
<
0
a<0.

Example: 
∣
5
∣
=
5
∣5∣=5, 
∣
−
5
∣
=
5
∣−5∣=5.

Note: Absolute value is always non-negative because distance cannot be negative.

✅ That gives us a solid block covering properties and basic number systems.

−4x+1 (cubic polynomial).

Note: “Poly” means many; “nomial” means terms. A polynomial is literally “many terms.”

Note: The degree helps classify polynomials:

Degree 1 → Linear

Degree 2 → Quadratic

Degree 3 → Cubic

Degree 4 → Quartic

Degree 5 → Quintic

Monomial, Binomial, Trinomial

Polynomials are often classified by the number of terms.

Monomial: 1 term (e.g. 
7
𝑥
3
7x
3
).

Binomial: 2 terms (e.g. 
𝑥
2
+
5
x
2
+5).

Trinomial: 3 terms (e.g. 
𝑥
2
+
3
𝑥
+
2
x
2
+3x+2).

Note: Polynomials with 4 or more terms are usually just called “polynomials.”

Adding and Subtracting Polynomials

Combine like terms (same variable, same exponent).

Example:

(
2
𝑥
2
+
3
𝑥
+
1
)
+
(

+3x+1)+(4x
2
−x+5)=6x

+2x+6

Note: Think of it as “merging families of like terms.”

Multiplying Polynomials

Use the distributive property (each term multiplies each term).

Example (Binomial × Binomial):

(
𝑥
+
2
)
(
𝑥
+
3
)
=

Factoring

The process of rewriting a polynomial as a product of simpler expressions.

Greatest Common Factor (GCF):
Factor out the largest common term.

Example: 
6
𝑥
2
+
9
𝑥
=
3
𝑥
(
2
𝑥
+
3
)
6x

25
=

)
(
𝑥
+
5
)
x

−25=(x−5)(x+5).

Trinomial Factoring:
Find two numbers that multiply to the constant and add to the middle coefficient.

Example: 
𝑥
2
+

𝑥
+
6
=
(
𝑥
+
2
)
(
𝑥

Grouping Method:
Rearrange and factor in pairs.

Note: Factoring “undoes” multiplication, and is essential for solving polynomial equations.

Solving Polynomial Equations

Set the polynomial equal to zero and solve for the variable.

Example:
Solve 
𝑥

+5x+6=0.
Factor:

x=−2,−3.

Note: This is called the Zero Product Property: if 
𝑎
𝑏
=

ab=0, then 
𝑎
=

a=0 or 
𝑏
=
0
b=0.

✅ At this point we’ve now built through Arithmetic → Properties → Number Systems → Exponents → Polynomials & Factoring.

Arithmetic & Algebra Basics (continued)
Linear Equation

An equation in which the highest power of the variable is 1. The graph of a linear equation is always a straight line.

General Form:

𝑦
=
𝑚
𝑥
+
𝑏
y=mx+b

where 
𝑚
m = slope and 
𝑏
b = y-intercept.

Example: 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
3
y=2x+3.

Note: “Linear” comes from “line” — it’s the simplest kind of equation to graph.

Slope

The measure of steepness of a line, represented by 
𝑚
m.

Formula:

m=
3−1

	​

=

4
	​

=2

Note: Positive slope = line rises left to right. Negative slope = line falls left to right. Zero slope = horizontal. Undefined slope = vertical.

Intercepts

y-intercept (b): The point where the line crosses the y-axis (
𝑥
=
0
x=0).

Example: In 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
3
y=2x+3, 
𝑏
=
3
b=3.

x-intercept: The point where the line crosses the x-axis (
𝑦
=
0
y=0).

Example: Solve 
0
=
2
𝑥
+
3
0=2x+3 → 
𝑥
=
−
1.5
x=−1.5.

Forms of Linear Equations

Solving Linear Equations

Goal: Isolate the variable using inverse operations.

Example:
Solve 
3
𝑥
+
5
=
11
3x+5=11.
Subtract 5: 
3
𝑥
=
6
3x=6.
Divide 3: 
𝑥
=
2
x=2.

Note: Always perform the same operation on both sides to keep balance.

Systems of Linear Equations

Two or more linear equations solved together.

Methods:

Graphing – Plot both lines, intersection = solution.

Substitution – Solve one equation for a variable, substitute into the other.

Elimination – Add/subtract equations to eliminate one variable.

Example (Substitution):
Solve:

𝑦
=
𝑥
+
2
y=x+2
2
𝑥
+
𝑦
=
8
2x+y=8

Substitute: 
2
𝑥
+
(
𝑥
+
2
)
=
8
2x+(x+2)=8.

3
𝑥
+
2
=
8
3x+2=8.

3
𝑥
=
6
3x=6.

𝑥
=
2
x=2.
Then 
𝑦
=
4
y=4.
Solution: 
(
2
,
4
)
(2,4).

Note: Systems can have one solution (intersecting lines), no solution (parallel lines), or infinitely many solutions (same line).

Linear Inequalities

Similar to linear equations but use inequality symbols instead of equals signs: 
>
,
<
,
≥
,
≤
>,<,≥,≤.

Example:
Solve 
2
𝑥
+
3
>
7
2x+3>7.
Subtract 3: 
2
𝑥
>
4
2x>4.
Divide 2: 
𝑥
>
2
x>2.

Graphing: Use shading on the number line or coordinate plane.

Solid line = inclusive (
≥
≥ or 
≤
≤).

Dashed line = strict (
>
> or 
<
<).

Note: Important Rule — when multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number, reverse the inequality sign.

Example: 
−
2
𝑥
>
6
−2x>6 → 
𝑥
<
−
3
x<−3.

✅ Now we’ve covered linear equations, slope, intercepts, forms, solving, systems, and inequalities.

Symmetrical about a vertical line called the axis of symmetry.

The highest or lowest point is called the vertex.

Parabolas may cross the x-axis at 0, 1, or 2 points (the real solutions).

Branched from Preface review and edit

You said:
we did that already: Preface

This book covers mathematics from high school algebra through fourth-year linear algebra. It blends foundational skills with advanced concepts, moving quickly while keeping explanations clear. We begin with algebra, introduce calculus early, and bring in just enough geometry and trigonometry to cover all essential topics. The goal is to prepare you not only for university placement exams but also for advanced study—up to the equivalent of a master’s level foundation.

Because this is an ambitious undertaking, emphasis is placed on building strong foundations through precise definitions, vocabulary, and cross-linked concepts. Rather than isolating topics, I weave them together so that you see mathematics as one connected whole. Every operation is thoroughly explained with definitions, illustrations, and step-by-step processes. The more you understand how math works, the less you will have to memorize or struggle with later.

My goal is to compress time: four years of high school math in one year, four years of undergraduate math in another—while also introducing abstraction. Exposure to advanced concepts early gives you a sense of how mathematics progresses and encourages creativity in building your own formulas and methods.

Formal logic and proof-writing will be included, but early definitions are written plainly so even younger readers are not overwhelmed. Explanations are intentionally short at first to preserve flow, then gradually grow in rigor. The book is based on my own experience, research, and synthesis of countless resources. If you ever feel you need more practice, I encourage you to pick up a used algebra or calculus book as a supplement—but my intention is to give you a self-contained reference.

In truth, you do not need endless repetition of the same problem. What you need is a clear overview of the mathematics and their relationships to each other. This book will equip you to create equations for real-life situations and solve them with increasing sophistication. You will also gain confidence to explore mathematics beyond this volume, engage with others online, and even contribute your own ideas.

Mathematics has two sides: pure and applied. Pure math defines the rules and logical framework; applied math uses those rules to solve real-world problems. If math is not enriching your life or helping solve problems, it has failed its purpose. Here, concepts are presented in a nontraditional but practical way, always with an eye toward usefulness.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

Audience – I wrote this book for everyone, regardless of age or skill level. Only basic arithmetic (+, −, ×, ÷) is assumed. Younger readers will encounter terms earlier than usual, giving them a head start. Adults will find gaps in their knowledge filled. Even if some material feels advanced, the book remains a valuable reference that prepares you for college and beyond.

Format – This book is part formal textbook, part upperclassman’s notes, and part conversation with a peer. Skip what you already know, pause where you need more clarity, and treat it like a guided dialogue. I wrote this at significant personal cost of time and resources because I believe access to complete, clear math instruction should not require endless subscriptions or piecemeal internet searches.

Style of Explanation – Definitions begin casually, then grow in rigor. Examples are sometimes long—not to waste time, but to ensure every step is illuminated. I refuse to leave gaps that might cause confusion later, especially when moving from one course or resource to another.

Beyond Basics – Many books stop at fundamentals. I take advanced concepts and make them understandable, then show how they apply to real-world situations. Instead of a detached teacher-student tone, I write as someone eager to share insights and clear approaches.

Order – We start with simple algebra and quickly incorporate higher-level concepts like functions and Greek notation. The problems are intentionally easy, so that the focus is on understanding the machinery behind the math. This allows you to walk into any course and recognize what to do.

Progression – After algebra, we move into calculus and then linear algebra. Once terminology and foundations are in place, math is applied directly to nearly 200 real-world problems.

Language – Every math term and symbol is explained thoroughly. If you can read English, you can use this book. Along the way, your reading and writing skills will improve alongside your math.

Enrichment – History, anecdotes, and side concepts are sprinkled in to make learning engaging, even when they aren’t strictly necessary for solving problems.

Scope – The most advanced fields are beyond this single volume. This book focuses on building foundations so that you can later approach engineering, physics, and other advanced sciences. A sequel will take on those challenges.

You’ll also find glossaries, reference tables, and data sets placed at the front and back of the book for convenience.


Arithmetic & Algebra Basics
Arithmetic

The branch of mathematics dealing with the basic operations of numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Example: 
7
+
3
=
10
7+3=10, 
9
−
4
=
5
9−4=5, 
6
×
8
=
48
6×8=48, 
20
÷
4
=
5
20÷4=5.

Note: These four operations are the foundation of all higher mathematics. Algebra, calculus, and beyond are essentially extensions and abstractions of these simple rules.

Algebra

A system of mathematics that uses letters and symbols (variables) to represent numbers and relationships. Algebra is about creating, manipulating, and solving equations.

Example: If 
𝑥
+
5
=
9
x+5=9, subtract 5 from both sides: 
𝑥
=
4
x=4.

Note: Algebra allows us to describe patterns, rules, and unknowns. It connects arithmetic with abstraction, letting us solve problems beyond simple computation.

Variable

A symbol, usually a letter, that represents a number whose value can change.

Example: In 
2
𝑥
+
3
=
9
2x+3=9, 
𝑥
x is the variable. Solving: 
2
𝑥
=
6
2x=6, so 
𝑥
=
3
x=3.

Note: Variables “vary.” They are placeholders until we define or calculate their value.

Constant

A fixed number that does not change.

Example: In 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
7
y=2x+7, the number 
7
7 is a constant.

Note: Constants anchor equations, giving them a stable reference.

Equation

A mathematical statement that two expressions are equal, connected by the symbol 
=
=.

Example: 
3
𝑥
+
2
=
11
3x+2=11. Solving gives 
3
𝑥
=
9
3x=9, then 
𝑥
=
3
x=3.

Note: The equals sign was first introduced in 1557 by Robert Recorde. He chose two parallel lines “because no two things can be more equal.”

Expression

A mathematical phrase made up of numbers, variables, and operations, but without an equals sign.

Example: 
4
𝑥
+
7
4x+7 is an expression.

Note: Expressions are like “incomplete thoughts.” Adding an equals sign turns an expression into an equation.

Order of Operations

The rules that tell us in what order to perform operations in an expression.

Rule: Parentheses → Exponents → Multiplication/Division → Addition/Subtraction (often remembered as PEMDAS).

Example: 
3
+
2
×
5
=
3
+
10
=
13
3+2×5=3+10=13 (not 25!).

Note: Following a consistent order ensures everyone gets the same result.




Arithmetic & Algebra Basics (continued)
Commutative Property

The order of addition or multiplication does not change the result.

Addition: 
𝑎
+
𝑏
=
𝑏
+
𝑎
a+b=b+a.

Multiplication: 
𝑎
×
𝑏
=
𝑏
×
𝑎
a×b=b×a.

Example: 
3
+
7
=
7

10
3+7=7+3=10. 
4
×
5
=
5
×
4
=
20
4×5=5×4=20.

Note: “Commutative” comes from commute (to move around). Subtraction and division are not commutative: 
8
−
3
≠
3
−
8
8−3

=3−8.

Associative Property

The way numbers are grouped (with parentheses) does not change the result for addition and multiplication.

Addition: 
(
𝑎
+
𝑏
)
+
𝑐
=
𝑎
+
(
𝑏
+
𝑐
)
(a+b)+c=a+(b+c).

Multiplication: 
(
𝑎
×
𝑏
)
×
𝑐
=
𝑎
×
(
𝑏
×
𝑐
)
(a×b)×c=a×(b×c).

Example: 
(
2
+
3
)
+
4
=
5
+
4
=
9
(2+3)+4=5+4=9. Also 
2
+
(
3
+
4
)
=
2
+
7
=
9
2+(3+4)=2+7=9.

Note: Subtraction and division are not associative.

Distributive Property

Multiplication distributes over addition or subtraction.

Rule: 
𝑎
(
𝑏
+
𝑐
)
=
𝑎
𝑏
+
𝑎
𝑐
a(b+c)=ab+ac.

Example: 
3
(
4
+
5
)
=
3
×
9
=
27
3(4+5)=3×9=27. Using distributive property: 
3
×
4
+
3
×
5
=
12
+
15
=
27
3×4+3×5=12+15=27.

Note: This property is a bridge between arithmetic and algebra—it lets us expand and simplify expressions.

Identity Property

Special numbers (called identities) leave other numbers unchanged when used in operations.

Addition Identity: 
𝑎
+
0
=
𝑎
a+0=a.

Multiplication Identity: 
𝑎
×
1
=
𝑎
a×1=a.

Example: 
6
+
0
=
6
6+0=6, 
9
×
1
=
9
9×1=9.

Note: Zero is the identity for addition; one is the identity for multiplication.

Inverse Property

Every number has an opposite (additive inverse) and, except zero, a reciprocal (multiplicative inverse).

Additive Inverse: 
𝑎
+
(
−
𝑎
)
=
0
a+(−a)=0.

Multiplicative Inverse: 
𝑎

𝑎

=1, for 
𝑎
≠
0
a


Example: The inverse of 
7
7 under addition is 
−
7
−7. The inverse of 
5
5 under multiplication is 
1
5
5
1
	​

.

Note: Inverses “undo” operations—this is the backbone of solving equations.

Numbers and Sets of Numbers

Numbers can be grouped into different sets depending on their properties.

Natural Numbers: 
1
,
2
,
3
,
…
1,2,3,… (counting numbers).

Whole Numbers: 
0
,

	​

,−

	​

,0.25).

Irrational Numbers: Numbers that cannot be written as fractions (e.g. 
𝜋
,
2
π,
2
	​

).

Real Numbers: All rational and irrational numbers combined.

Imaginary Numbers: Numbers involving 
𝑖
i, where 
𝑖
=
−
1
i=
−1
	​

.

Complex Numbers: Numbers of the form 
𝑎
+
𝑏
𝑖
a+bi with both real and imaginary parts.

Note: Each set “builds” on the previous one—natural numbers grow into whole numbers, then integers, rationals, and so on.

Absolute Value

The distance a number is from zero on the number line.

Definition: 
∣
𝑎
∣
=
𝑎
∣a∣=a if 
𝑎
≥
0
a≥0, and 
∣
𝑎
∣
=
−
𝑎
∣a∣=−a if 
𝑎
<
0
a<0.

Example: 
∣
5
∣
=
5
∣5∣=5, 
∣
−
5
∣
=
5
∣−5∣=5.

Note: Absolute value is always non-negative because distance cannot be negative.

=b if and only if 
𝑏
𝑛

Note: This makes switching between radical form and exponent form seamless.

Scientific Notation

A way of writing very large or very small numbers using powers of 10.

Definition: A number is in scientific notation if written as

𝑎
×
10
𝑛
where 
1
≤
∣
𝑎
∣
<
10
a×10

.

0.00045

0.00045=4.5×10
−4
.

Note: Used heavily in science, engineering, and data science to manage extreme values.

Order of Magnitude

The power of ten closest to a given number.

Example: The order of magnitude of 
43
,
000
43,000 is 
10
4

.

Note: Useful for quick comparisons—two values of the same order of magnitude are within about a factor of 10 of each other.

−4x+1 (cubic polynomial).

Note: “Poly” means many; “nomial” means terms. A polynomial is literally “many terms.”

Degree of a Polynomial

The highest exponent of the variable.

Example:

4
𝑥
5
+
2
𝑥
3
−
𝑥
+
7
4x
5
+2x
3
−x+7 has degree 5.

9
𝑥
2
+
6
9x
2
+6 has degree 2.

Note: The degree helps classify polynomials:

Degree 1 → Linear

Degree 2 → Quadratic

Degree 3 → Cubic

Degree 4 → Quartic

Degree 5 → Quintic

Monomial, Binomial, Trinomial

Polynomials are often classified by the number of terms.

Monomial: 1 term (e.g. 
7
𝑥
3
7x
3
).

Binomial: 2 terms (e.g. 
𝑥
2
+
5
x
2
+5).

Trinomial: 3 terms (e.g. 
𝑥
2
+
3
𝑥
+
2
x
2
+3x+2).

Note: Polynomials with 4 or more terms are usually just called “polynomials.”

Adding and Subtracting Polynomials

Combine like terms (same variable, same exponent).

Example:

(
2
𝑥
2
+
3
𝑥
+
1
)
+
(
4
𝑥

−
𝑥

𝑥
2
+
2
𝑥
+
6
(2x
2
+3x+1)+(4x
2
−x+5)=6x
2
+2x+6

Note: Think of it as “merging families of like terms.”

Multiplying Polynomials

Use the distributive property (each term multiplies each term).

Example (Binomial × Binomial):

(
𝑥
+
2
)
(
𝑥
+
3
)
=
𝑥
2

3
𝑥

6
(x+2)(x+3)=x
2
+3x+2x+6=x
2
+5x+6

Note: FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) is a shortcut for multiplying two binomials.

Factoring

The process of rewriting a polynomial as a product of simpler expressions.

Greatest Common Factor (GCF):
Factor out the largest common term.

Example: 
6
𝑥
2
+
9
𝑥
=
3
𝑥
(
2
𝑥

6
=
(
𝑥

Example:
Solve 
𝑥

Arithmetic & Algebra Basics (continued)
Linear Equation

An equation in which the highest power of the variable is 1. The graph of a linear equation is always a straight line.

General Form:

𝑦
=
𝑚
𝑥
+
𝑏
y=mx+b

where 
𝑚
m = slope and 
𝑏
b = y-intercept.

Example: 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
3
y=2x+3.

Note: “Linear” comes from “line” — it’s the simplest kind of equation to graph.

m=

=
2
4
	​

=2

Note: Positive slope = line rises left to right. Negative slope = line falls left to right. Zero slope = horizontal. Undefined slope = vertical.

Intercepts

y-intercept (b): The point where the line crosses the y-axis (
𝑥
=
0
x=0).

Example: In 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
3
y=2x+3, 
𝑏
=
3
b=3.

x-intercept: The point where the line crosses the x-axis (
𝑦
=
0
y=0).

Example: Solve 
0
=
2
𝑥
+
3
0=2x+3 → 
𝑥
=
−
1.5
x=−1.5.

Solving Linear Equations

Goal: Isolate the variable using inverse operations.

Example:
Solve 
3
𝑥
+
5
=
11
3x+5=11.
Subtract 5: 
3
𝑥
=
6
3x=6.
Divide 3: 
𝑥
=
2
x=2.

Note: Always perform the same operation on both sides to keep balance.

Systems of Linear Equations

Two or more linear equations solved together.

Methods:

Graphing – Plot both lines, intersection = solution.

Substitution – Solve one equation for a variable, substitute into the other.

Elimination – Add/subtract equations to eliminate one variable.

Example (Substitution):
Solve:

𝑦
=
𝑥
+
2
y=x+2
2
𝑥
+
𝑦
=
8
2x+y=8

Substitute: 
2
𝑥
+
(
𝑥
+
2
)
=
8
2x+(x+2)=8.

3
𝑥
+
2
=
8
3x+2=8.

3
𝑥
=
6
3x=6.

𝑥
=
2
x=2.
Then 
𝑦
=
4
y=4.
Solution: 
(
2
,
4
)
(2,4).

Note: Systems can have one solution (intersecting lines), no solution (parallel lines), or infinitely many solutions (same line).

Linear Inequalities

Similar to linear equations but use inequality symbols instead of equals signs: 
>
,
<
,
≥
,
≤
>,<,≥,≤.

Example:
Solve 
2
𝑥
+
3
>
7
2x+3>7.
Subtract 3: 
2
𝑥
>
4
2x>4.
Divide 2: 
𝑥
>
2
x>2.

Graphing: Use shading on the number line or coordinate plane.

Solid line = inclusive (
≥
≥ or 
≤
≤).

Dashed line = strict (
>
> or 
<
<).

Note: Important Rule — when multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number, reverse the inequality sign.

Example: 
−
2
𝑥
>
6
−2x>6 → 
𝑥
<
−
3
x<−3.

Quadratic Equations

a>0, downward if 
𝑎

0
a<0.

Symmetrical about a vertical line called the axis of symmetry.

The highest or lowest point is called the vertex.

Parabolas may cross the x-axis at 0, 1, or 2 points (the real solutions).

50
	​

=

Functions & Graphs
Definition of a Function

A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input.

Input → Output

Often written as f(x), read as “f of x.”

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
2
𝑥
+
3
f(x)=2x+3

Input 
𝑥
=
1
x=1 → 
𝑓
(
1
)
=
2
(
1
)
+
3
=
5
f(1)=2(1)+3=5

Input 
𝑥
=
4
x=4 → 
𝑓
(
4
)
=
2
(
4
)
+
3
=
11
f(4)=2(4)+3=11

Note: Each input has only one output. If a single input has multiple outputs, it is not a function.

Domain and Range

Domain: All possible input values 
𝑥
x for which the function is defined.

Range: All possible output values 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x).

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
−
1
f(x)=
x−1
	​


Domain: 
𝑥
−
1
≥
0
⇒
𝑥
≥
1
x−1≥0⇒x≥1

Range: 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
≥
0
f(x)≥0 because square roots are non-negative

Note: Domain and range define the limits of a function.

Function Notation

f(x) represents the output of the function for input 
𝑥
x.

To evaluate: replace 
𝑥
x with a number.

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
+
2
𝑥
f(x)=x
2
+2x
𝑓
(

+
2
(
3
)
=
9
+
6
=

f(3)=3
2
+2(3)=9+6=15

Note: Function notation helps distinguish the rule from an equation.

Q(x)

Graphs often have vertical/horizontal asymptotes

Graphing Functions

Steps to graph:

Identify domain and range.

Determine key points (intercepts, vertex, asymptotes).

Sketch graph smoothly through points.

Check symmetry (even/odd functions) if applicable.

Example: Graph 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥

f(0)=−4

Graph: Parabola opening upward with vertex at (0, -4).

Transformations of Functions

+
𝑘
f(x)+k → shift up by 
𝑘
k if 
𝑘
>
0
k>0, down if 
𝑘
<
0
k<0

Horizontal Shifts: 
𝑓
(
𝑥

ℎ
)
f(x−h) → shift right by 
ℎ
h if 
ℎ
>
0
h>0, left if 
ℎ
<
0
h<0

Reflections:

−
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
−f(x) → reflect over x-axis

𝑓
(
−
𝑥
)
f(−x) → reflect over y-axis

Stretches/Compressions:

𝑎
⋅
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
a⋅f(x) → vertical stretch if 
∣
𝑎
∣
>
1
∣a∣>1, compression if

Solving exponential and logarithmic equations
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Let’s build a clear, step-by-step guide for solving exponential and logarithmic equations, keeping it in the same style as your book.

📘 Solving Exponential & Logarithmic Equations
1. Exponential Equations

An exponential equation has a variable in the exponent:

𝑎
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑏
a
f(x)
=b
Step-by-Step Methods

Method 1: Same Base

If 
𝑎
𝑥
=
𝑎
𝑦
a
x
=a
y
, then 
𝑥
=
𝑦
x=y

Example:

2
3
𝑥
−
1
=
16
2
3x−1
=16

Step 1: Express both sides with the same base:

16
=
2
4
16=2
4

Step 2: Equate exponents:

3
𝑥
−
1
=
4
3x−1=4

Step 3: Solve for 
𝑥
x:

3
𝑥
=
5
⇒
𝑥
=
5
3
3x=5⇒x=
3
5
	​


Method 2: Logarithms

If bases are not the same or hard to match, take logarithms on both sides:

𝑎
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑏
⇒
ln
⁡
(
𝑎
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
=
ln
⁡
(
𝑏
)
a
f(x)
=b⇒ln(a
f(x)
)=ln(b)

Use the power law: 
ln
⁡
(
𝑎
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
=
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
ln
⁡
(
𝑎
)
ln(a
f(x)
)=f(x)ln(a)

Example:

3
2
𝑥
+
1
=
20
3
2x+1
=20

Step 1: Take natural log:

ln
⁡
(
3
2
𝑥
+
1
)
=
ln
⁡
(
20
)
ln(3
2x+1
)=ln(20)

Step 2: Bring exponent down:

(
2
𝑥
+
1
)
ln
⁡
(
3
)
=
ln
⁡
(
20
)
(2x+1)ln(3)=ln(20)

Step 3: Solve for 
𝑥
x:

2
𝑥
+
1
=
ln
⁡
(
20
)
ln
⁡
(
3
)
⇒
𝑥
=
ln
⁡
(
20
)
/
ln
⁡
(
3
)
−
1
2
2x+1=
ln(3)
ln(20)
	​

⇒x=
2
ln(20)/ln(3)−1
	​


Method 3: Graphical / Approximation

Sometimes equations cannot be solved exactly with simple logs.

Graph 
𝑦
=
𝑎
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
y=a
f(x)
 and 
𝑦
=
𝑏
y=b, intersection = solution.

Or use numerical methods (calculator or approximation).

2. Logarithmic Equations

A logarithmic equation has the variable inside a log:

log
⁡
𝑏
(
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
=
𝑐
log
b
	​

(f(x))=c
Step-by-Step Methods

Method 1: Convert to Exponential Form

log
⁡
𝑏
(
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
=
𝑐
⇒
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑏
𝑐
log
b
	​

(f(x))=c⇒f(x)=b
c

Example:

log
⁡
2
(
𝑥
−
1
)
=
3
log
2
	​

(x−1)=3

Step 1: Convert:

𝑥
−
1
=
2
3
x−1=2
3

Step 2: Solve for 
𝑥
x:

𝑥
−
1
=
8
⇒
𝑥
=
9
x−1=8⇒x=9

Method 2: Use Log Laws

Combine logs if needed using product, quotient, and power rules.

Then convert to exponential form to solve.

Example:

log
⁡
3
(
𝑥
)
+
log
⁡
3
(
𝑥
−
2
)
=
2
log
3
	​

(x)+log
3
	​

(x−2)=2

Step 1: Combine logs:

log
⁡
3
(
𝑥
(
𝑥
−
2
)
)
=
2
log
3
	​

(x(x−2))=2

Step 2: Convert to exponential form:

𝑥
(
𝑥
−
2
)
=
3
2
=
9
x(x−2)=3
2
=9

Step 3: Solve quadratic:

𝑥
2
−
2
𝑥
−
9
=
0
x
2
−2x−9=0

Step 4: Factor or use quadratic formula:

𝑥
=
1
±
10
x=1±
10
	​


Step 5: Check domain (log must be positive):

𝑥
>
0
 and 
𝑥
−
2
>
0
⇒
𝑥
>
2
x>0 and x−2>0⇒x>2

✅ Valid solution:

𝑥
=
1
+
10
≈
4.16
x=1+
10
	​

≈4.16

Method 3: Change of Base

If base is inconvenient, use natural log or log base 10:

log
⁡
𝑏
(
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
=
𝑐
⇒
ln
⁡
(
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
ln
⁡
(
𝑏
)
=
𝑐
log
b
	​

(f(x))=c⇒
ln(b)
ln(f(x))
	​

=c

Solve for 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) and then for the variable.

3. Important Tips

Domain check: Logarithms require positive arguments (
𝑥
>
0
x>0, 
𝑥
−
2
>
0
x−2>0, etc.).

One solution vs. multiple: Exponentials can have one solution; logarithms can be restricted.

Check for extraneous solutions: Squaring or combining logs may introduce invalid solutions.

Key Properties

Number of Roots (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra)
A polynomial of degree 
𝑛
n has exactly 
𝑛
n roots in the complex numbers (some may be repeated or complex).

End Behavior

Leading term 
𝑎

x
n
 dominates as 
∣
𝑥
∣
→

∣x∣→∞.

If 
𝑛
n is even: both ends → same direction.

If 
𝑛
n is odd: ends → opposite directions.

Leading coefficient positive → right end up; negative → right end down.

Multiplicity of Roots

If 
(
𝑥
−
𝑟
)
𝑘
(x−r)
k
 divides 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x), 
𝑟
r is a root of multiplicity 
𝑘
k.

Odd multiplicity → graph crosses x-axis.

Even multiplicity → graph touches x-axis.

x−r is a factor.

Repeat until polynomial is completely factored.

2.6 Solving Higher-Degree Equations

Steps:

Factor out GCF.

Look for special patterns (difference of squares, cubes, etc.).

Use Rational Root Theorem & synthetic division.

Factor resulting quadratic or cubic using standard methods.

Solve for all roots (real and complex).

3.1 Long Division of Polynomials

Polynomial long division works like numerical long division.

Steps:

Arrange both dividend and divisor in descending powers of 
𝑥
x.

Divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor → first term of quotient.

Multiply the divisor by this term → subtract from dividend.

Bring down the next term and repeat until the remainder has lower degree than the divisor.

3.2 Synthetic Division

Synthetic division is a shortcut for dividing by linear divisors of the form 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r. It is faster than long division.

Steps:

Write down coefficients of the dividend in order. Include 0 for missing powers.

Write 
𝑟
r (from divisor 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r) to the left.

Bring down the first coefficient.

Multiply it by 
𝑟
r, write under the next coefficient, and add.

Repeat until all coefficients are used.

The last number is the remainder; the other numbers are coefficients of the quotient.

Example:

Divide 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
=
2
𝑥
3

𝑥

r=−2

Step 1: Coefficients: 2, 3, -1, 5

Step 2: Setup:

-2 | 2   3   -1   5
       ↓


Step 3: Bring down 2 → 2

Step 4: Multiply 2 * -2 = -4 → add to 3 → -1

Step 5: Multiply -1 * -2 = 2 → add to -1 → 1

Step 6: Multiply 1 * -2 = -2 → add to 5 → 3 (remainder)

Result: Quotient coefficients: 2, -1, 1 →

✅ Tips

Use synthetic division for linear divisors (
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r) only.

Always check remainder: if remainder = 0 → 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r is a factor.

Can be used to test Rational Root Theorem candidates quickly.

For higher-degree polynomials, combine with factoring, special patterns, and substitutions.

If you want, I can make a worked examples section with 10+ advanced long division and synthetic division problems, including tricky divisors and testing rational roots. This is perfect for your advanced “Polynomials and Factoring” chapter.

4. Remainder and Factor Theorems

These theorems make testing and factoring polynomials much faster.

4.1 Remainder Theorem

Statement:

If a polynomial 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x) is divided by 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r, the remainder is 
𝑃
(
𝑟
)
P(r).

That means instead of doing full division, you can just substitute 
𝑥
=
𝑟
x=r into the polynomial.

This gives the remainder immediately.

Example 1:

Divide 
𝑃
(
𝑥

Remainder = 31

4.2 Factor Theorem

Statement:

If 
𝑃
(
𝑟
)
=
0
P(r)=0, then 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r is a factor of 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x).

Conversely, if 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r is a factor of 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x), then 
𝑃
(
𝑟
)
=
0
P(r)=0.

This is extremely useful for factoring higher-degree polynomials.

Example 1:

Check if 
𝑥

𝑃
(

)
=
𝑥

P(2)=(2)

−4(2)
2
+2+6=8−16+2+6=0

✅ So

x−2 is a factor.

We can then divide 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x) by 
𝑥
−
2
x−2 (using synthetic or long division) to find the other factor(s).

5. Solving Cubic and Quartic Equations

Cubic (degree 3) and quartic (degree 4) equations are more complex than quadratics, but the same principles apply: factor, use the remainder/factor theorem, or apply formulas if needed.

5.1 Solving Cubic Equations

A cubic equation has the general form:

Use the Rational Root Theorem: potential rational roots are of the form

𝑟
=
±
factors of constant term 
𝑑
factors of leading coefficient 
𝑎
r=±
factors of leading coefficient a
factors of constant term d
	​

Step 2: Test Roots Using Factor Theorem

Substitute candidates into the cubic. If 
𝑃
(
𝑟
)
=
0
P(r)=0, 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r is a factor.

Step 3: Factor Out a Linear Factor

Use synthetic or long division to divide the cubic by 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r, giving a quadratic.

Step 4: Solve the Quadratic

Solve the resulting quadratic using factoring, completing the square, or quadratic formula.

If a root 
𝑟
r is found:

𝑥

Tips for Cubic & Quartic

Always look for rational roots first; it simplifies factoring.

Repeated roots may occur. Check discriminant of quadratic factors.

Synthetic division is your friend—faster than long division.

If no rational roots exist, you may need numerical methods or cubic/quartic formulas.

If you want, I can create a full visual “flowchart” showing the process for solving cubic and quartic equations, combining rational root theorem, synthetic division, and factoring—this makes it very intuitive for readers.

📘 Polynomials and Factoring (Advanced)
6. Graph Behavior of Polynomials

Polynomials can have different shapes depending on their degree and leading coefficient. Understanding their end behavior and turning points helps in graphing.

6.1 End Behavior

The end behavior describes what happens to the graph of 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) as 
𝑥
→
∞
x→∞ or 
𝑥
→
−
∞
x→−∞.

For a polynomial:

𝑛
n → highest power of 
𝑥

Leading coefficient 
𝑎
𝑛

	​

 → coefficient of 
𝑥
𝑛

Rules for End Behavior
Degree (n)	Leading Coefficient (a_n)	End Behavior
Even	Positive	Both ends up
Even	Negative	Both ends down
Odd	Positive	Left down, right up
Odd	Negative	Left up, right down

Examples:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
2
𝑥
4
−
3
𝑥
3
+
…
f(x)=2x
4
−3x
3
+… → degree 4 (even), leading coefficient 2 (+) → both ends up.

+
5
𝑥
2
−

f(x)=−x
3
+5x
2
−1 → degree 3 (odd), leading coefficient -1 → left up, right down.

6.2 Turning Points

A turning point is where the graph changes direction (local maxima or minima).

Maximum Number of Turning Points

A polynomial of degree 
𝑛
n can have at most 
𝑛
−
1
n−1 turning points.

Examples:

Linear (
𝑛
=
1
n=1) → 0 turning points

Quadratic (
𝑛
=
2
n=2) → 1 turning point

Cubic (
𝑛
=
3
n=3) → at most 2 turning points

Quartic (
𝑛
=
4
n=4) → at most 3 turning points

6.3 Graph Shape and Multiplicity of Roots

Multiplicity of a root affects the graph at 
𝑥
=
𝑟
x=r:

Odd multiplicity → graph crosses the x-axis

Even multiplicity → graph touches but doesn’t cross the x-axis

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
(
𝑥
−
1
)
2
(
𝑥
+
2
)
f(x)=(x−1)
2
(x+2)

Root 
𝑥
=
1
x=1, multiplicity 2 → graph touches x-axis at 1

Root 
𝑥
=
−
2
x=−2, multiplicity 1 → graph crosses x-axis at -2

6.4 Summary Steps to Sketch Polynomial Graphs

Find degree and leading coefficient → determine end behavior.

Factor polynomial → find roots and their multiplicities.

Determine turning points → max 
𝑛
−
1
n−1.

Plot x-intercepts (with multiplicities) and y-intercept (
𝑓
(
0
)
f(0)).

Sketch smooth curve through intercepts according to end behavior.

If you want, I can make a visual cheat sheet showing the typical shapes of polynomials by degree and multiplicity, which is super useful for teaching or studying.

📘 Rational Functions and Asymptotes
1. Definition of Rational Functions

A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials:

𝑅
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
R(x)=
Q(x)
P(x)

where 
𝑃
(

P(x) and 
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
Q(x) are polynomials, and 
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
≠
0
Q(x)

=0.

Examples:

Note: Rational functions are undefined where the denominator is zero.

2. Vertical Asymptotes

Vertical asymptotes occur where the function approaches infinity because the denominator is zero (and the numerator is non-zero).

Rule:
If

Q(x)=0 at 
𝑥

x=a and 
𝑃
(
𝑎

0
P(a)

=0, then 
𝑥

𝑎
x=a is a vertical asymptote.

Example:

𝑓

⟹
  
𝑥
=
2
 is a vertical asymptote
f(x)=

⟹x=2 is a vertical asymptote

4. Oblique (Slant) Asymptotes

When 
deg
⁡
(
𝑃
)
=
deg
⁡
(
𝑄
)
+
1
deg(P)=deg(Q)+1, the rational function has a slant asymptote.

How to find it: Use polynomial long division:

𝑃

𝑥
)
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
=
quotient
+
remainder
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
Q(x)
P(x)
	​

=quotient+
Q(x)
remainder
	​


The quotient gives the slant asymptote.

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
+
𝑥
+
1
𝑥
−
1
f(x)=
x−1
x
2
+x+1
	​


Divide 
𝑥

+
𝑥

x

+x+1 by 
𝑥

x−1:

𝑥

𝑥

)
(
𝑥

)

+x+1=(x+2)(x−1)+3

So slant asymptote: 
𝑦

y=x+2

5. Intercepts

𝑥
x

y-intercept: Set 
𝑥
=

x=0, compute 
𝑓

f(0)

Example:

𝑥

f(x)=

6. Sketching Rational Functions

Steps:

Find vertical asymptotes (denominator = 0).

Find horizontal/slant asymptotes (end behavior).

Find x- and y-intercepts.

Check signs between asymptotes and intercepts.

Sketch the curve approaching asymptotes, passing through intercepts.

Applications of Rational Functions:

Physics: Resistance, pressure, optics (inverse square laws).

Engineering: Flow rates, gear ratios.

Economics: Supply/demand curves, cost/revenue functions.

Biology: Population models, enzyme kinetics.

I can continue next with Polynomial and Rational Function Graphing combined, which shows behavior near asymptotes and turning points—very useful for exam preparation.

Vertical and horizontal asymptotes
ChatGPT said:

Sure! Let’s focus specifically on vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

📘 Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
1. Vertical Asymptotes

Definition:
A vertical asymptote is a vertical line 
𝑥
=
𝑎
x=a where the function grows without bound (
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
→
∞
f(x)→∞ or 
−
∞
−∞).

How to find them:

Take a rational function 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
f(x)=
Q(x)
P(x)
	​

.

Set the denominator equal to zero: 
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
=
0
Q(x)=0.

Solve for 
𝑥
x.

Any solution where the numerator is not also zero is a vertical asymptote.

Example:

𝑓

𝑥

f(x)=
x−3

(Check the sign of numerator and denominator on each side.)

2. Horizontal Asymptotes

Definition:
A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line 
𝑦

y=c that the function approaches as 
𝑥
→
∞
x→∞ or 
𝑥

Vertical asymptotes: where the function is undefined (denominator = 0).

Horizontal asymptotes: long-term behavior as 
𝑥
→
∞
x→∞ or 
𝑥
→
−
∞
x→−∞.

A rational function can have multiple vertical asymptotes but at most one horizontal asymptote.

If you want, I can make a simple step-by-step method with a diagram showing both vertical and horizontal asymptotes so it’s super clear visually.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Holes in graphs
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Let’s cover holes in graphs—they’re closely related to vertical asymptotes.

📘 Holes in Graphs of Rational Functions
Definition:

A hole is a point on the graph where the function is undefined, but the discontinuity is removable. In other words, the graph “skips” that point instead of going to infinity.

Holes occur when a factor cancels from both numerator and denominator.

How to Find Holes

Factor the numerator and denominator completely.

Look for common factors that appear in both numerator and denominator.

Set the common factor equal to zero to find the x-coordinate of the hole.

Plug this x-value into the simplified function (after canceling the factor) to find the y-coordinate.

Example 1:
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
(
𝑥
−
2
)
(
𝑥
+

)
(
𝑥

)
(

f(x)=
(x−2)(x−5)
(x−2)(x+3)
	​


Step 1: Factor check

Common factor: 
𝑥

x−2 appears in numerator and denominator.

Step 2: Identify x-coordinate

Set 
𝑥

Key Points:

Holes only occur where factors cancel.

Vertical asymptotes occur where factors remain in the denominator after simplification.

Always simplify the function first before identifying holes.

If you want, I can combine vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and holes into one visual diagram so it’s easy to see all types of discontinuities on one graph.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
Domain restrictions
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Domain restrictions are closely tied to what we just discussed about vertical asymptotes and holes. Let’s go through it carefully.

📘 Domain Restrictions of Rational Functions
Definition:

The domain of a function is the set of all possible x-values for which the function is defined (does not break or become undefined).

For rational functions 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
f(x)=
Q(x)
P(x)
	​

:

The function is undefined wherever the denominator 
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
=
0
Q(x)=0.

These points may result in vertical asymptotes or holes depending on whether the factor cancels.

Steps to Find Domain Restrictions

Factor the denominator completely.

Set denominator ≠ 0.

Solve for x-values that must be excluded from the domain.

Check for cancelled factors:

If a factor cancels with the numerator → hole.

If a factor remains → vertical asymptote.

Example 1:
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
−
4
𝑥
2
−
𝑥
−
6
f(x)=
x
2
−x−6
x

	​


Step 1: Factor numerator and denominator

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
(
𝑥
−
2
)
(
𝑥
+
2
)
(
𝑥
−
3
)
(
𝑥
+
2
)
f(x)=
(x−3)(x+2)
(x−2)(x+2)
	​


Step 2: Denominator = 0

(
𝑥
−
3
)
(
𝑥
+
2
)
=
0
  
⟹
  
𝑥
=
3
 or 
𝑥
=
−
2
(x−3)(x+2)=0⟹x=3 or x=−2

Step 3: Identify holes vs vertical asymptotes

𝑥
=
−
2
x=−2 → cancels → hole

𝑥
=
3
x=3 → remains → vertical asymptote

⟹

𝑥
∈
𝑅
,
  
𝑥
≠
−
3
,

Domain: x∈R,x

Key Points:

Always check the denominator: any x that makes it zero is excluded.

Canceled factors → holes, uncanceled → vertical asymptotes.

Domain is all real numbers except restricted x-values.

If you like, the next step could be graphing rational functions with domain restrictions, holes, and asymptotes all labeled, which visually ties everything together.

Do you want me to do that next?

Applications in real-world modeling
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Rational functions with domain restrictions, vertical asymptotes, and holes are not just abstract—they show up in many real-world scenarios. Here’s a structured overview:

📘 Applications of Rational Functions in Real-World Modeling
1. Physics – Motion and Resistance

Example: Velocity of a falling object with air resistance can be modeled as:

𝑣
(
𝑡
)
=
𝑚
𝑔
𝑏
(
1
−
𝑒
−
𝑏
𝑚
𝑡
)
v(t)=
b
mg
	​

(1−e
−
m
b
	​

t
)

Here, the denominator often represents resistance factors. Domain restrictions arise because certain time values may be physically impossible (e.g., negative time).

Vertical asymptotes can indicate situations where velocity approaches infinity theoretically (like singularities in idealized models).

2. Chemistry – Reaction Rates

Michaelis-Menten Equation for enzyme kinetics:

𝑣
=
𝑉
max
⁡
[
𝑆
]
𝐾
𝑚
+
[
𝑆
]
v=
K
m
	​

+[S]
V

	​

[S]
	​


Domain restriction: Substrate concentration 
[
𝑆

−
𝐾
𝑚
[S]

=−K
m
	​

 (though in practice 
[
𝑆
]
>
0
[S]>0)

Interpretation: The reaction rate can never reach infinite values because the denominator ensures a horizontal asymptote at 
𝑣
=
𝑉
max
⁡
v=V
max
	​

.

3. Economics – Cost and Revenue Models

Example: Average cost per unit:

𝐶
(
𝑥
)
=
𝐹
+
𝑉
𝑥
𝑥
=
𝐹
𝑥
+
𝑉
C(x)=
x
F+Vx
	​

=
x
F
	​

+V

𝐹
F = fixed costs, 
𝑉
V = variable cost per unit, 
𝑥
x = number of units produced.

Domain restriction: 
𝑥
>
0
x>0 (cannot produce zero or negative items).

Asymptotic behavior: As production increases, 
𝐹
𝑥
→
0
x
F
	​

→0, showing economies of scale.

4. Engineering – Structural Stress

Stress on a beam under load can sometimes be modeled as:

𝜎
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑃
𝐴
−
𝑘
𝑥
σ(x)=
A−kx
P
	​


𝑃
P = load, 
𝐴
A = cross-sectional area, 
𝑘
k = material constant, 
𝑥
x = position along beam

Domain restriction: 
𝐴
−
𝑘
𝑥
≠
0
  
⟹
  
𝑥
≠
𝐴
𝑘
A−kx

=0⟹x

=
k
A
	​


Interpretation: Vertical asymptote signals a theoretical failure point of the material.

5. Population Dynamics – Ecology

Rational functions can model population growth with limiting factors:

𝑃
(
𝑡
)
=
𝐾
1
+
𝐴
𝑒
−
𝑟
𝑡
P(t)=
1+Ae
−rt
K
	​


𝐾
K = carrying capacity, 
𝐴
A = constant, 
𝑟
r = growth rate

Domain: 
𝑡
∈
𝑅
t∈R (time)

Horizontal asymptote: Population approaches carrying capacity 
𝐾
K.

Key Takeaways

Domain restrictions correspond to impossible or undefined real-world situations (like division by zero).

Vertical asymptotes often represent thresholds, failure points, or singularities.

Holes usually indicate temporary exclusions or values that cancel out in real-world formulas.

Rational functions are powerful tools in physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and engineering.

If you want, the next natural topic is Exponential and Logarithmic Functions in Growth and Decay, which often pairs beautifully with rational functions in modeling.

Do you want me to move to that next?

B. Elimination Method

Choose two equations and eliminate the same variable.

Repeat with a different pair to eliminate the same variable.

Infinitely Many Solutions – planes intersect along a line or coincide.

Check:

If determinant of coefficient matrix 
𝐴
≠
0
A

=0 → unique solution.

If determinant 
=
0
=0 → check consistency for no/infinite solutions.

4. Applications

Engineering: Forces in 3 directions, statics problems.

Economics: Solve supply-demand models with 3 products.

Physics: Motion with 3 simultaneous constraints.

Chemistry: Reaction stoichiometry with 3 unknowns.

I can continue with nonlinear systems, word problems, and applications as the next step if you like.

Do you want me to go there?

6. Advantages of Cramer’s Rule

Systematic and easy for small systems (2×2 or 3×3).

Gives exact solution using determinants.

Note: For larger systems, Gaussian elimination or matrix inverses are more practical.

If you want, I can create a visual step-by-step example with determinants expanded for clarity—it really makes Cramer’s Rule intuitive.

Applications to word problems and optimization
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Let’s extend systems of equations to real-world applications and optimization problems. I’ll break it down step by step.

1. Word Problems

Word problems often translate a real-world scenario into a system of equations.

Example:

A farmer has chickens and cows. There are 20 animals in total, and they have 56 legs altogether. How many chickens and cows are there?

Step 1: Define variables

Let 
𝑥
=
x= number of chickens

Let 
𝑦
=
y= number of cows

Step 2: Translate into equations

Total animals:

𝑥
+
𝑦
=
20
x+y=20

Total legs:

2
𝑥

2. Optimization Problems Using Systems

Sometimes you want to maximize or minimize a quantity subject to constraints. Systems of equations often appear in linear programming problems.

Example:

A factory makes two products, A and B.

Each unit of A takes 2 hours of labor and 3 kg of material.

Each unit of B takes 1 hour of labor and 2 kg of material.

Total labor available: 100 hours

Total material available: 120 kg

Profit per unit: A = $30, B = $20

Goal: Maximize profit.

Step 1: Define variables

Let 
𝑥
=
x= units of A

Let 
𝑦
=
y= units of B

Step 2: Write constraints as equations/inequalities

Labor: 
2
𝑥
+
𝑦
≤
100
2x+y≤100

Material: 
3
𝑥
+
2
𝑦
≤
120
3x+2y≤120

Non-negative: 
𝑥
≥
0
,
𝑦
≥
0
x≥0,y≥0

Step 3: Write objective function
𝑃
=
30
𝑥
+
20
𝑦
P=30x+20y
Step 4: Solve

Solve the inequalities system to find feasible region (graphically or via substitution).

Check the vertices of the feasible region to find maximum profit (this is standard linear programming).

This is a direct application of systems of equations to real-world optimization.

I can make a full solved example with graphing the feasible region and picking the optimal solution—it’s really visual and helps students see exactly how systems + optimization interact.

6. Inequalities and Absolute Value (Extended)

Compound inequalities
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Let’s expand Inequalities and Absolute Value with compound inequalities.

1. Compound Inequalities

A compound inequality combines two simple inequalities using and or or.

a) “And” Inequalities

Both conditions must be true.

Solution is the overlap of the two inequalities.

Example:

2
<
𝑥
+
1
≤
5
2<x+1≤5

Step 1: Solve each part

2
<
𝑥
+
1
  
⟹
  
𝑥
>
1
2<x+1⟹x>1
𝑥
+
1
≤
5
  
⟹
  
𝑥
≤
4
x+1≤5⟹x≤4

Step 2: Combine

1
<
𝑥
≤
4
1<x≤4

✅ Solution: All numbers between 1 and 4, not including 1 but including 4.

Graphically: Open circle at 1, closed circle at 4, shading in between.

b) “Or” Inequalities

Either condition can be true.

Solution is the union of the two inequalities.

Example:

𝑥
−
3
<
−
1
or
𝑥
+
2
>
5
x−3<−1orx+2>5

Step 1: Solve each inequality

𝑥
−
3
<
−
1
  
⟹
  
𝑥
<
2
x−3<−1⟹x<2
𝑥
+
2
>
5
  
⟹
  
𝑥
>
3
x+2>5⟹x>3

Step 2: Combine

𝑥
<
2
or
𝑥
>
3
x<2orx>3

✅ Solution: Numbers less than 2 or greater than 3.

Graphically: Shade left of 2 and right of 3, leaving a gap in between.

2. Absolute Value Inequalities

Absolute value represents distance from 0, so inequalities involve two cases.

a) “Less than”
∣
𝑥
∣
<
𝑎
  
⟹
  
−
𝑎
<
𝑥
<
𝑎
∣x∣<a⟹−a<x<a

Example:

∣
𝑥
−
2
∣
<
5
∣x−2∣<5

Step 1: Remove absolute value

−
5
<
𝑥
−
2
<
5
−5<x−2<5

Step 2: Solve for 
𝑥
x

−
3
<
𝑥
<
7
−3<x<7

✅ Solution: Numbers between -3 and 7 (not including endpoints if < sign).

b) “Greater than”
∣
𝑥
∣
>
𝑎
  
⟹
  
𝑥
<
−
𝑎
or
𝑥
>
𝑎
∣x∣>a⟹x<−aorx>a

Example:

∣
2
𝑥
+
1
∣
>
7
∣2x+1∣>7

Step 1: Remove absolute value

2
𝑥
+
1
<
−
7
or
2
𝑥
+
1
>
7
2x+1<−7or2x+1>7

Step 2: Solve each part

2
𝑥
<
−
8
  
⟹
  
𝑥
<
−
4
2x<−8⟹x<−4
2
𝑥
>
6
  
⟹
  
𝑥
>
3
2x>6⟹x>3

✅ Solution: 
𝑥
<
−
4
x<−4 or 
𝑥
>
3
x>3

3. Applications

Distance problems: |x - a| < b → x is within b units of a.

Tolerance problems: Measurements must be within a certain range.

Finance: Maximum/minimum thresholds, e.g., budgets or allowable error margins.

Next, we could extend this to graphing compound absolute value inequalities on a number line or coordinate plane—it’s very visual and makes solutions intuitive.

Do you want me to include that next?

You said:
Graphing regions in the coordinate plane
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Let’s extend Inequalities and Absolute Value to graphing regions in the coordinate plane.

Graphing Inequalities in the Coordinate Plane

An inequality in two variables, like 
𝑦
<
2
𝑥
+
3
y<2x+3, represents a region of the plane rather than a single line.

1. Steps to Graph a Linear Inequality

Take 
𝑦
≤
2
𝑥
+
3
y≤2x+3 as an example:

Step 1: Graph the boundary line

Replace the inequality with an equals sign: 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
3
y=2x+3.

This is a straight line.

Step 2: Choose solid or dashed line

≤ or ≥ → solid line (points on the line are included).

< or > → dashed line (points on the line are not included).

Step 3: Test a point

Pick a point not on the line, e.g., 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0).

Substitute into the inequality:

0
≤
2
(
0
)
+
3
  
⟹
  
0
≤
3
 ✅ true
0≤2(0)+3⟹0≤3 ✅ true

Shade the region containing the test point.

Step 4: Shade the correct half-plane

All solutions of the inequality lie in the shaded region.

2. Graphing Compound Inequalities

“And” inequalities: Shade the overlap of the two regions.

Example:

𝑦
≥
𝑥
+
1
and
𝑦
<
3
𝑥
−
2
y≥x+1andy<3x−2

Graph both lines (solid for ≥, dashed for <).

Shade the region where the two shaded areas intersect.

“Or” inequalities: Shade any region that satisfies at least one of the inequalities.

3. Absolute Value Inequalities in 2D

Absolute value inequalities form V-shaped regions or bands.

Example 1:

∣
𝑦
−
𝑥
∣
≤
2
∣y−x∣≤2

Rewrite as a compound inequality:

−
2
≤
𝑦
−
𝑥
≤
2
  
⟹
  
𝑥
−
2
≤
𝑦
≤
𝑥
+
2
−2≤y−x≤2⟹x−2≤y≤x+2

Graph the boundary lines: 
𝑦
=
𝑥
−
2
y=x−2 (solid), 
𝑦
=
𝑥
+
2
y=x+2 (solid).

Shade between the two lines.

Example 2:

∣
𝑥
∣
+
∣
𝑦
∣
≤
4
∣x∣+∣y∣≤4

Forms a diamond-shaped region.

Represents all points within distance 4 from the origin along axes.

4. Applications

Feasible regions in optimization (linear programming).

Physical constraints: e.g., area where an object can move.

Tolerance zones: e.g., manufacturing limits for x and y dimensions.

If you want, I can draw a few sample graphs for linear and absolute value inequalities so it’s perfectly visual—very handy for students.

You said:
Applications in real-world constraints
ChatGPT said:

Here’s how inequalities and absolute value in the coordinate plane connect to real-world constraints:

Applications of Inequalities and Absolute Value in Real-World Constraints

Inequalities often describe limits, boundaries, and feasible solutions. Absolute value adds the idea of distance or deviation from a target.

1. Budget and Resource Limits

Scenario: A company produces chairs and tables.

Let 
𝑥
=
x= chairs, 
𝑦
=
y= tables.

Budget limits:

50
𝑥
+
80
𝑦
≤
2000
50x+80y≤2000

Graph the inequality. The shaded region shows all production combinations that stay under budget.

Note: This is a feasible region for planning.

2. Distance Constraints

Scenario: A delivery drone must stay within 10 km of a warehouse.

Let 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y) be the drone’s location relative to the warehouse at (0,0).

𝑥
2
+
𝑦
2
≤
10
x
2
+y
2
	​

≤10

Graphing: A circle of radius 10 shows the area the drone can operate in.

Absolute value variations:

∣
𝑥
∣
+
∣
𝑦
∣
≤
10
∣x∣+∣y∣≤10

Forms a diamond-shaped area—used in grid-based navigation.

3. Manufacturing Tolerances

Scenario: Parts must be within ±0.5 mm of a target size:

∣
𝑥
−
10
∣
≤
0.5
∣x−10∣≤0.5

All acceptable sizes are in the interval [9.5, 10.5].

Visualized as a band or strip if plotting two variables.

4. Environmental and Safety Constraints

Example: Pollution levels:

Let 
𝑥
=
x= chemical A, 
𝑦
=
y= chemical B.

Safety limits:

𝑥
+
2
𝑦
≤
100
x+2y≤100

The feasible region shows safe combinations of chemical levels.

5. Optimization and Linear Programming

Inequalities define feasible regions for maximizing or minimizing objectives.

Example: Maximize profit subject to:

𝑥
≥
0
,
𝑦
≥
0
,
3
𝑥
+
2
𝑦
≤
120
x≥0,y≥0,3x+2y≤120

The intersection of these inequalities is where solutions are allowed.

✅ Key Takeaways:

Inequalities = limits or constraints.

Absolute value = tolerance, distance, or deviation.

Graphing regions = visualizing all possible solutions.

Essential for engineering, economics, logistics, and physics.

Here’s a structured explanation of De Moivre’s Theorem for advanced algebra/trigonometry:

De Moivre’s Theorem

De Moivre’s Theorem gives a powerful way to raise complex numbers to powers or extract roots using their polar form.

1. Statement of the Theorem

If 
𝑧
=
𝑟
(
cos
⁡
𝜃
+
𝑖
sin
⁡
𝜃
)
z=r(cosθ+isinθ), then for any integer

Simplifying Radical Expressions

A radical expression involves a root, usually a square root (
  
	​

) or higher (
  
𝑛
n
	​

). Simplifying means rewriting it in its simplest form.

1. Simplifying Square Roots
Step 1: Factor the radicand (number inside the root)

Break the number into perfect squares and other factors.

72
=
36
⋅
2
72
	​

=
36⋅2
	​

Step 2: Separate the root
36

2
=
36
⋅
2
=
6
2
36⋅2

	​


✅ Simplest form:

2. Key Parameters

Amplitude (
𝑎
a)

The maximum distance from the midline.

∣
𝑎
∣
∣a∣ determines how “tall” the wave is.

Sine/Cosine only. Tangent has no amplitude.

Period (
𝑇
T)

The length of one full cycle.

Sine/Cosine: 
𝑇
=
2
𝜋
𝑏
T=
b
2π
	​


Tangent/Cotangent: 
𝑇
=
𝜋
𝑏
T=
b
π
	​


Phase Shift (
𝑐
/
𝑏
c/b)

Horizontal shift left/right.

Vertical Shift (
𝑑
d)

Moves the midline up or down.

3. Sine and Cosine Graphs

Sine: Starts at midline, rises to maximum, falls to minimum, returns to midline.

Cosine: Starts at maximum (or minimum if 
𝑎
<
0
a<0), then falls/rises like a wave.

Example:

𝑦
=
2
sin
⁡
(
3
𝑥
−
𝜋
/
4
)
+
1
y=2sin(3x−π/4)+1

Amplitude = 2

Period = 
2
𝜋
/
3
2π/3

Phase shift = 
𝜋
/
12
π/12 right

Midline = 
𝑦
=
1
y=1

4. Tangent Graph

Repeats every 
𝜋
/
𝑏
π/b units.

Vertical asymptotes where 
cos
⁡
(
𝑏
𝑥
−
𝑐
)
=
0
cos(bx−c)=0 (denominator of 
tan
⁡
=
sin
⁡
/
cos
⁡
tan=sin/cos)

Crosses midline at the origin of the cycle.

Steep slope near asymptotes.

5. Steps to Graph

Identify amplitude, period, phase shift, vertical shift.

Draw the midline (for sine/cosine).

Mark key points for one period: max, min, midline crossings.

Sketch the wave smoothly.

For tangent: plot asymptotes first, then midline crossing.

Repeat for additional periods if needed.

[

−
∣
𝑎
∣
,
𝑑
+
∣
𝑎
∣
]
[d−∣a∣,d+∣a∣].

Tangent and Cotangent: Repeats every 
𝜋
/
𝑏
π/b, asymptotes where function undefined.

Secant and Cosecant: Reciprocal of cosine/sine → curves “shoot up/down” at asymptotes.

Quick Sketch Tips

Step 1: Draw midline 
𝑦
=
𝑑
y=d.

Step 2: Mark amplitude (for sine/cosine).

Step 3: Calculate period → divide for key points.

Step 4: Add phase shift.

Step 5: Sketch wave or reciprocal curves.

If you want, I can draw an actual visual diagram of all six functions on one coordinate plane, labeled with midlines, amplitudes, asymptotes, and one full period each—so you’ll have a single-page cheat sheet.

4. Applications in Real Life

Engineering: Vibrations of bridges, buildings, or machinery.

Physics: Pendulums, oscillating springs, circuits with AC current.

Sound & Light: Modeling waves and harmonics.

Navigation: Circular motion in orbits.

I can also draw a visual diagram showing the unit circle, sine/cosine waves, and oscillation graphs together—it really helps students see the connection.

Do you want me to make that visual next?
