Preface

This book covers mathematics from high school algebra through fourth-year linear algebra. It blends foundational skills with advanced concepts, moving quickly while keeping explanations clear. We begin with algebra, introduce calculus early, and bring in just enough geometry and trigonometry to cover all essential topics. The goal is to prepare you not only for university placement exams but also for advanced study—up to the equivalent of a master’s level foundation.

Because this is an ambitious undertaking, emphasis is placed on building strong foundations through precise definitions, vocabulary, and cross-linked concepts. Rather than isolating topics, I weave them together so that you see mathematics as one connected whole. Every operation is thoroughly explained with definitions, illustrations, and step-by-step processes. The more you understand how math works, the less you will have to memorize or struggle with later.

My goal is to compress time: four years of high school math in one year, four years of undergraduate math in another—while also introducing abstraction. Exposure to advanced concepts early gives you a sense of how mathematics progresses and encourages creativity in building your own formulas and methods.

Formal logic and proof-writing will be included, but early definitions are written plainly so even younger readers are not overwhelmed. Explanations are intentionally short at first to preserve flow, then gradually grow in rigor. The book is based on my own experience, research, and synthesis of countless resources. If you ever feel you need more practice, I encourage you to pick up a used algebra or calculus book as a supplement—but my intention is to give you a self-contained reference.

In truth, you do not need endless repetition of the same problem. What you need is a clear overview of the mathematics and their relationships to each other. This book will equip you to create equations for real-life situations and solve them with increasing sophistication. You will also gain confidence to explore mathematics beyond this volume, engage with others online, and even contribute your own ideas.

Mathematics has two sides: pure and applied. Pure math defines the rules and logical framework; applied math uses those rules to solve real-world problems. If math is not enriching your life or helping solve problems, it has failed its purpose. Here, concepts are presented in a nontraditional but practical way, always with an eye toward usefulness.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

Audience – I wrote this book for everyone, regardless of age or skill level. Only basic arithmetic (+, −, ×, ÷) is assumed. Younger readers will encounter terms earlier than usual, giving them a head start. Adults will find gaps in their knowledge filled. Even if some material feels advanced, the book remains a valuable reference that prepares you for college and beyond.

Format – This book is part formal textbook, part upperclassman’s notes, and part conversation with a peer. Skip what you already know, pause where you need more clarity, and treat it like a guided dialogue. I wrote this at significant personal cost of time and resources because I believe access to complete, clear math instruction should not require endless subscriptions or piecemeal internet searches.

Style of Explanation – Definitions begin casually, then grow in rigor. Examples are sometimes long—not to waste time, but to ensure every step is illuminated. I refuse to leave gaps that might cause confusion later, especially when moving from one course or resource to another.

Beyond Basics – Many books stop at fundamentals. I take advanced concepts and make them understandable, then show how they apply to real-world situations. Instead of a detached teacher-student tone, I write as someone eager to share insights and clear approaches.

Order – We start with simple algebra and quickly incorporate higher-level concepts like functions and Greek notation. The problems are intentionally easy, so that the focus is on understanding the machinery behind the math. This allows you to walk into any course and recognize what to do.

Progression – After algebra, we move into calculus and then linear algebra. Once terminology and foundations are in place, math is applied directly to nearly 200 real-world problems.

Language – Every math term and symbol is explained thoroughly. If you can read English, you can use this book. Along the way, your reading and writing skills will improve alongside your math.

Enrichment – History, anecdotes, and side concepts are sprinkled in to make learning engaging, even when they aren’t strictly necessary for solving problems.

Scope – The most advanced fields are beyond this single volume. This book focuses on building foundations so that you can later approach engineering, physics, and other advanced sciences. A sequel will take on those challenges.

You’ll also find glossaries, reference tables, and data sets placed at the front and back of the book for convenience.

Arithmetic & Algebra Basics
Arithmetic

The branch of mathematics dealing with the basic operations of numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Example: 
7
+
3
=
10
7+3=10, 
9
−
4
=
5
9−4=5, 
6
×
8
=
48
6×8=48, 
20
÷
4
=
5
20÷4=5.

Note: These four operations are the foundation of all higher mathematics. Algebra, calculus, and beyond are essentially extensions and abstractions of these simple rules.

Algebra

A system of mathematics that uses letters and symbols (variables) to represent numbers and relationships. Algebra is about creating, manipulating, and solving equations.

Example: If 
𝑥
+
5
=
9
x+5=9, subtract 5 from both sides: 
𝑥
=
4
x=4.

Note: Algebra allows us to describe patterns, rules, and unknowns. It connects arithmetic with abstraction, letting us solve problems beyond simple computation.

Variable

A symbol, usually a letter, that represents a number whose value can change.

Example: In 
2
𝑥
+
3
=
9
2x+3=9, 
𝑥
x is the variable. Solving: 
2
𝑥
=
6
2x=6, so 
𝑥
=
3
x=3.

Note: Variables “vary.” They are placeholders until we define or calculate their value.

Constant

A fixed number that does not change.

Example: In 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
7
y=2x+7, the number 
7
7 is a constant.

Note: Constants anchor equations, giving them a stable reference.

Equation

A mathematical statement that two expressions are equal, connected by the symbol 
=
=.

Example: 
3
𝑥
+
2
=
11
3x+2=11. Solving gives 
3
𝑥
=
9
3x=9, then 
𝑥
=
3
x=3.

Note: The equals sign was first introduced in 1557 by Robert Recorde. He chose two parallel lines “because no two things can be more equal.”

Expression

A mathematical phrase made up of numbers, variables, and operations, but without an equals sign.

Example: 
4
𝑥
+
7
4x+7 is an expression.

Note: Expressions are like “incomplete thoughts.” Adding an equals sign turns an expression into an equation.

Order of Operations

The rules that tell us in what order to perform operations in an expression.

Rule: Parentheses → Exponents → Multiplication/Division → Addition/Subtraction (often remembered as PEMDAS).

Example: 
3
+
2
×
5
=
3
+
10
=
13
3+2×5=3+10=13 (not 25!).

Note: Following a consistent order ensures everyone gets the same result.




Arithmetic & Algebra Basics (continued)
Commutative Property

The order of addition or multiplication does not change the result.

Addition: 
𝑎
+
𝑏
=
𝑏
+
𝑎
a+b=b+a.

Multiplication: 
𝑎
×
𝑏
=
𝑏
×
𝑎
a×b=b×a.

Example: 
3
+
7
=
7

10
3+7=7+3=10. 
4
×
5
=
5
×
4
=
20
4×5=5×4=20.

Note: “Commutative” comes from commute (to move around). Subtraction and division are not commutative: 
8
−
3
≠
3
−
8
8−3

=3−8.

Associative Property

The way numbers are grouped (with parentheses) does not change the result for addition and multiplication.

Addition: 
(
𝑎
+
𝑏
)
+
𝑐
=
𝑎
+
(
𝑏
+
𝑐
)
(a+b)+c=a+(b+c).

Multiplication: 
(
𝑎
×
𝑏
)
×
𝑐
=
𝑎
×
(
𝑏
×
𝑐
)
(a×b)×c=a×(b×c).

Example: 
(
2
+
3
)
+
4
=
5
+
4
=
9
(2+3)+4=5+4=9. Also 
2
+
(
3
+
4
)
=
2
+
7
=
9
2+(3+4)=2+7=9.

Note: Subtraction and division are not associative.

Distributive Property

Multiplication distributes over addition or subtraction.

Rule: 
𝑎
(
𝑏
+
𝑐
)
=
𝑎
𝑏
+
𝑎
𝑐
a(b+c)=ab+ac.

Example: 
3
(
4
+
5
)
=
3
×
9
=
27
3(4+5)=3×9=27. Using distributive property: 
3
×
4
+
3
×
5
=
12
+
15
=
27
3×4+3×5=12+15=27.

Note: This property is a bridge between arithmetic and algebra—it lets us expand and simplify expressions.

Identity Property

Special numbers (called identities) leave other numbers unchanged when used in operations.

Addition Identity: 
𝑎
+
0
=
𝑎
a+0=a.

Multiplication Identity: 
𝑎
×
1
=
𝑎
a×1=a.

Example: 
6
+
0
=
6
6+0=6, 
9
×
1
=
9
9×1=9.

Note: Zero is the identity for addition; one is the identity for multiplication.

Inverse Property

Every number has an opposite (additive inverse) and, except zero, a reciprocal (multiplicative inverse).

Additive Inverse: 
𝑎
+
(
−
𝑎
)
=
0
a+(−a)=0.

Multiplicative Inverse: 
𝑎
×
1
𝑎
=

a×
a
1
	​

=1, for 
𝑎
≠
0
a


Example: The inverse of 
7
7 under addition is 
−
7
−7. The inverse of 
5
5 under multiplication is 
1
5
5
1
	​

.

Note: Inverses “undo” operations—this is the backbone of solving equations.

Numbers and Sets of Numbers

Numbers can be grouped into different sets depending on their properties.

Natural Numbers: 
1
,
2
,
3
,
…
1,2,3,… (counting numbers).

Whole Numbers: 
0
,

	​

,−

	​

,0.25).

Irrational Numbers: Numbers that cannot be written as fractions (e.g. 
𝜋

2
π,
2
	​

).

Real Numbers: All rational and irrational numbers combined.

Imaginary Numbers: Numbers involving 
𝑖
i, where 
𝑖
=
−
1
i=
−1
	​

.

Complex Numbers: Numbers of the form 
𝑎
+
𝑏
𝑖
a+bi with both real and imaginary parts.

Note: Each set “builds” on the previous one—natural numbers grow into whole numbers, then integers, rationals, and so on.

Absolute Value

The distance a number is from zero on the number line.

Definition: 
∣
𝑎
∣
=
𝑎
∣a∣=a if 
𝑎
≥
0
a≥0, and 
∣
𝑎
∣
=
−
𝑎
∣a∣=−a if 
𝑎
<
0
a<0.

Example: 
∣
5
∣
=
5
∣5∣=5, 
∣
−
5
∣
=
5
∣−5∣=5.

Note: Absolute value is always non-negative because distance cannot be negative.

Exponents represent repeated multiplication of the same number.

Definition:

Note: This makes switching between radical form and exponent form seamless.

Scientific Notation

A way of writing very large or very small numbers using powers of 10.

Definition: A number is in scientific notation if written as

𝑎
×
10
𝑛
where 
1
≤
∣
𝑎
∣
<
10
a×10

.

Note: Used heavily in science, engineering, and data science to manage extreme values.

Order of Magnitude

The power of ten closest to a given number.

Example: The order of magnitude of 
43
,
000
43,000 is 
10

−4x+1 (cubic polynomial).

Note: “Poly” means many; “nomial” means terms. A polynomial is literally “many terms.”

Degree of a Polynomial

The highest exponent of the variable.

Example:

4
𝑥
5
+
2
𝑥
3
−
𝑥

7
4x
5
+2x
3
−x+7 has degree 5.

9

+
6
9x
2
+6 has degree 2.

Note: The degree helps classify polynomials:

Degree 1 → Linear

Degree 2 → Quadratic

Degree 3 → Cubic

Degree 4 → Quartic

Degree 5 → Quintic

Monomial, Binomial, Trinomial

Polynomials are often classified by the number of terms.

Monomial: 1 term (e.g. 
7
𝑥
3
7x
3
).

Binomial: 2 terms (e.g. 
𝑥
2
+
5
x
2
+5).

Trinomial: 3 terms (e.g. 
𝑥
2
+
3
𝑥
+
2
x
2
+3x+2).

Note: Polynomials with 4 or more terms are usually just called “polynomials.”

Adding and Subtracting Polynomials

Combine like terms (same variable, same exponent).

Example:

(
2
𝑥
2
+
3
𝑥
+
1
)
+
(
4
𝑥

−
𝑥

𝑥
2
+
2
𝑥
+
6
(2x
2
+3x+1)+(4x
2
−x+5)=6x
2
+2x+6

Note: Think of it as “merging families of like terms.”

Multiplying Polynomials

Use the distributive property (each term multiplies each term).

Example (Binomial × Binomial):

(
𝑥
+
2
)
(
𝑥
+
3
)
=
𝑥
2

3
𝑥

𝑥
+
6
(x+2)(x+3)=x
2
+3x+2x+6=x
2
+5x+6

Note: FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) is a shortcut for multiplying two binomials.

Factoring

The process of rewriting a polynomial as a product of simpler expressions.

Greatest Common Factor (GCF):
Factor out the largest common term.

Example: 
6
𝑥
2
+
9
𝑥
=
3
𝑥
(
2
𝑥
+
3

6
=
(
𝑥
+
2
)
(
𝑥

Grouping Method:
Rearrange and factor in pairs.

Example: 
𝑥

2
+2)(x+3).

Note: Factoring “undoes” multiplication, and is essential for solving polynomial equations.

Solving Polynomial Equations

Set the polynomial equal to zero and solve for the variable.

Example:
Solve 
𝑥
2

5
𝑥

x
2
+5x+6=0.
Factor:

(x+2)(x+3)=0.
Solutions:

a=0 or 
𝑏

Arithmetic & Algebra Basics (continued)
Linear Equation

An equation in which the highest power of the variable is 1. The graph of a linear equation is always a straight line.

General Form:

𝑦
=
𝑚
𝑥
+
𝑏
y=mx+b

where 
𝑚
m = slope and 
𝑏
b = y-intercept.

Example: 
𝑦

Note: Positive slope = line rises left to right. Negative slope = line falls left to right. Zero slope = horizontal. Undefined slope = vertical.

Intercepts

y-intercept (b): The point where the line crosses the y-axis (
𝑥
=
0
x=0).

Example: In 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
3
y=2x+3, 
𝑏
=
3
b=3.

x-intercept: The point where the line crosses the x-axis (
𝑦
=
0
y=0).

Example: Solve 
0
=
2
𝑥
+
3
0=2x+3 → 
𝑥
=
−
1.5
x=−1.5.

Forms of Linear Equations

−2x+y=3.

Solving Linear Equations

Goal: Isolate the variable using inverse operations.

Example:
Solve 
3
𝑥
+
5
=
11
3x+5=11.
Subtract 5: 
3
𝑥
=
6
3x=6.
Divide 3: 
𝑥
=
2
x=2.

Note: Always perform the same operation on both sides to keep balance.

Systems of Linear Equations

Two or more linear equations solved together.

Methods:

Graphing – Plot both lines, intersection = solution.

Substitution – Solve one equation for a variable, substitute into the other.

Elimination – Add/subtract equations to eliminate one variable.

Example (Substitution):
Solve:

𝑦
=
𝑥
+
2
y=x+2
2
𝑥
+
𝑦
=
8
2x+y=8

Substitute: 
2
𝑥
+
(
𝑥
+
2
)
=
8
2x+(x+2)=8.

3
𝑥
+
2
=
8
3x+2=8.

3
𝑥
=
6
3x=6.

𝑥
=
2
x=2.
Then 
𝑦
=
4
y=4.
Solution: 
(
2
,
4
)
(2,4).

Note: Systems can have one solution (intersecting lines), no solution (parallel lines), or infinitely many solutions (same line).

Linear Inequalities

Similar to linear equations but use inequality symbols instead of equals signs: 
>
,
<
,
≥
,
≤
>,<,≥,≤.

Example:
Solve 
2
𝑥
+
3
>
7
2x+3>7.
Subtract 3: 
2
𝑥
>
4
2x>4.
Divide 2: 
𝑥
>
2
x>2.

Graphing: Use shading on the number line or coordinate plane.

Solid line = inclusive (
≥
≥ or 
≤
≤).

Dashed line = strict (
>
> or 
<
<).

Note: Important Rule — when multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number, reverse the inequality sign.

Example: 
−
2
𝑥
>
6
−2x>6 → 
𝑥
<
−
3
x<−3.

Quadratic Equations
Definition

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2, meaning the highest exponent is 2.

General Form:

𝑎
𝑥
2
+
𝑏
𝑥

𝑐
=
0
ax

+bx+c=0

where 
𝑎
,
𝑏
,
𝑐
a,b,c are constants and 
𝑎
≠

a

=0.

Examples:

𝑥

Note: The graph of a quadratic is called a parabola.

The Parabola

Opens upward if 
𝑎
>
0
a>0, downward if 
𝑎
<
0

Symmetrical about a vertical line called the axis of symmetry.

The highest or lowest point is called the vertex.

Parabolas may cross the x-axis at 0, 1, or 2 points (the real solutions).

✅ Now we’ve covered definition, graph, solving methods, quadratic formula, discriminant, vertex form, and applications.

The natural next step is Radicals & Rational Expressions (since solving quadratics often introduces square roots and fractions).

Functions & Graphs
Definition of a Function

A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input.

Input → Output

Often written as f(x), read as “f of x.”

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
2
𝑥
+
3
f(x)=2x+3

Input 
𝑥
=
1
x=1 → 
𝑓
(
1
)
=
2
(
1
)
+
3
=
5
f(1)=2(1)+3=5

Input 
𝑥
=
4
x=4 → 
𝑓
(
4
)
=
2
(
4
)
+
3
=
11
f(4)=2(4)+3=11

Note: Each input has only one output. If a single input has multiple outputs, it is not a function.

Domain and Range

Domain: All possible input values 
𝑥
x for which the function is defined.

Range: All possible output values 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x).

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
−
1
f(x)=
x−1
	​


Domain: 
𝑥
−
1
≥
0
⇒
𝑥
≥
1
x−1≥0⇒x≥1

Range: 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
≥
0
f(x)≥0 because square roots are non-negative

Note: Domain and range define the limits of a function.

Function Notation

f(x) represents the output of the function for input 
𝑥
x.

To evaluate: replace 
𝑥
x with a number.

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥

📘 Solving Exponential & Logarithmic Equations
1. Exponential Equations

An exponential equation has a variable in the exponent:

𝑎
𝑓

Step-by-Step Methods

Method 1: Same Base

If 
𝑎
𝑥
=
𝑎
𝑦
a
x
=a
y
, then 
𝑥
=
𝑦
x=y

Example:

2
3
𝑥
−
1
=
16
2
3x−1
=16

Step 1: Express both sides with the same base:

16
=
2
4
16=2
4

Step 2: Equate exponents:

3
𝑥
−
1
=
4
3x−1=4

Step 3: Solve for 
𝑥
x:

3
𝑥
=
5
⇒
𝑥
=
5
3
3x=5⇒x=
3
5
	​


Method 2: Logarithms

If bases are not the same or hard to match, take logarithms on both sides:

𝑎
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑏
⇒
ln
⁡
(
𝑎
𝑓

)
a
f(x)
=b⇒ln(a
f(x)
)=ln(b)

Method 3: Graphical / Approximation

Sometimes equations cannot be solved exactly with simple logs.

Graph 
𝑦
=
𝑎
𝑓

𝑥
)
y=a
f(x)
 and 
𝑦
=
𝑏
y=b, intersection = solution.

Or use numerical methods (calculator or approximation).

2. Logarithmic Equations

A logarithmic equation has the variable inside a log:

log
⁡
𝑏
(
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
=
𝑐
log
b
	​

(f(x))=c
Step-by-Step Methods

Method 1: Convert to Exponential Form

log
⁡
𝑏
(
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
=
𝑐
⇒
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑏
𝑐
log
b
	​

(f(x))=c⇒f(x)=b
c

Example:

log
⁡
2
(
𝑥
−
1
)
=
3
log
2
	​

(x−1)=3

Step 1: Convert:

𝑥
−
1
=
2
3
x−1=2
3

Step 2: Solve for 
𝑥
x:

𝑥
−
1
=
8
⇒
𝑥
=
9
x−1=8⇒x=9

Method 2: Use Log Laws

Combine logs if needed using product, quotient, and power rules.

Then convert to exponential form to solve.

Example:

log
⁡
3
(
𝑥
)
+
log
⁡
3
(
𝑥
−
2
)
=
2
log
3
	​

(x)+log
3
	​

(x−2)=2

Step 1: Combine logs:

log
⁡
3
(
𝑥
(
𝑥
−
2
)
)
=
2
log
3
	​

(x(x−2))=2

Step 2: Convert to exponential form:

𝑥
(
𝑥
−
2
)
=
3
2
=
9
x(x−2)=3
2
=9

Step 3: Solve quadratic:

𝑥
2
−
2
𝑥
−
9
=
0
x
2
−2x−9=0

Step 4: Factor or use quadratic formula:

𝑥
=
1
±
10
x=1±
10
	​


Step 5: Check domain (log must be positive):

𝑥
>
0
 and 
𝑥
−
2
>
0
⇒
𝑥
>
2
x>0 and x−2>0⇒x>2

✅ Valid solution:

𝑥
=
1
+
10
≈
4.16
x=1+
10
	​

≈4.16

Method 3: Change of Base

If base is inconvenient, use natural log or log base 10:

log
⁡
𝑏
(
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
=
𝑐
⇒
ln
⁡
(
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
)
ln
⁡
(
𝑏
)
=
𝑐
log
b
	​

(f(x))=c⇒
ln(b)
ln(f(x))
	​

=c

Solve for 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) and then for the variable.

3. Important Tips

Domain check: Logarithms require positive arguments (
𝑥
>
0
x>0, 
𝑥
−
2
>
0
x−2>0, etc.).

One solution vs. multiple: Exponentials can have one solution; logarithms can be restricted.

Check for extraneous solutions: Squaring or combining logs may introduce invalid solutions.

If 
𝑛
n is even: both ends → same direction.

If 
𝑛
n is odd: ends → opposite directions.

Leading coefficient positive → right end up; negative → right end down.

Multiplicity of Roots

x−r is a factor.

Repeat until polynomial is completely factored.

2.6 Solving Higher-Degree Equations

Steps:

Factor out GCF.

Look for special patterns (difference of squares, cubes, etc.).

Use Rational Root Theorem & synthetic division.

Factor resulting quadratic or cubic using standard methods.

3. Long Division and Synthetic Division

These are methods to divide polynomials, similar to numerical division. They are useful to:

Factor polynomials

Simplify expressions

Solve polynomial equations

3.1 Long Division of Polynomials

Polynomial long division works like numerical long division.

Steps:

Arrange both dividend and divisor in descending powers of 
𝑥
x.

Divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor → first term of quotient.

Multiply the divisor by this term → subtract from dividend.

Bring down the next term and repeat until the remainder has lower degree than the divisor.

Example:

Divide

3.2 Synthetic Division

Synthetic division is a shortcut for dividing by linear divisors of the form 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r. It is faster than long division.

Steps:

Write down coefficients of the dividend in order. Include 0 for missing powers.

Write 
𝑟
r (from divisor 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r) to the left.

Bring down the first coefficient.

Multiply it by 
𝑟
r, write under the next coefficient, and add.

Repeat until all coefficients are used.

The last number is the remainder; the other numbers are coefficients of the quotient.

Example:

Divide 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
=
2
𝑥
3
+
3
𝑥
2
−
𝑥

P(x)=2x

+3x
2
−x+5 by 
𝑥

2
x+2 → 
𝑟
=

r=−2

Step 1: Coefficients: 2, 3, -1, 5

Step 2: Setup:

-2 | 2   3   -1   5
       ↓


Step 3: Bring down 2 → 2

Step 4: Multiply 2 * -2 = -4 → add to 3 → -1

Step 5: Multiply -1 * -2 = 2 → add to -1 → 1

Step 6: Multiply 1 * -2 = -2 → add to 5 → 3 (remainder)

Result: Quotient coefficients: 2, -1, 1 →

✅ Tips

Use synthetic division for linear divisors (
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r) only.

Always check remainder: if remainder = 0 → 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r is a factor.

Can be used to test Rational Root Theorem candidates quickly.

For higher-degree polynomials, combine with factoring, special patterns, and substitutions.

4. Remainder and Factor Theorems

These theorems make testing and factoring polynomials much faster.

4.1 Remainder Theorem

Statement:

If a polynomial 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x) is divided by 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r, the remainder is 
𝑃
(
𝑟
)
P(r).

That means instead of doing full division, you can just substitute 
𝑥
=
𝑟
x=r into the polynomial.

This gives the remainder immediately.

Example 1:

Divide 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)

Remainder = 31

4.2 Factor Theorem

Statement:

If 
𝑃
(
𝑟
)
=
0
P(r)=0, then 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r is a factor of 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x).

Conversely, if 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r is a factor of 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x), then 
𝑃
(
𝑟
)
=
0
P(r)=0.

This is extremely useful for factoring higher-degree polynomials.

Example 1:

Check if 
𝑥
−
2
x−2 is a factor of 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥

−
4

P(2)=(2)
3
−4(2)
2
+2+6=8−16+2+6=0

✅ So 
𝑥
−
2
x−2 is a factor.

We can then divide 
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x) by 
𝑥
−
2
x−2 (using synthetic or long division) to find the other factor(s).

5. Solving Cubic and Quartic Equations

Cubic (degree 3) and quartic (degree 4) equations are more complex than quadratics, but the same principles apply: factor, use the remainder/factor theorem, or apply formulas if needed.

5.1 Solving Cubic Equations

A cubic equation has the general form:

𝑏
𝑥
2
+
𝑐
𝑥

𝑑
=
0
,
𝑎

Step 1: Look for Rational Roots

Use the Rational Root Theorem: potential rational roots are of the form

𝑟
=
±
factors of constant term 
𝑑
factors of leading coefficient 
𝑎
r=±
factors of leading coefficient a
factors of constant term d
	​

Step 2: Test Roots Using Factor Theorem

Substitute candidates into the cubic. If 
𝑃
(
𝑟
)
=
0
P(r)=0, 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r is a factor.

Step 3: Factor Out a Linear Factor

Use synthetic or long division to divide the cubic by 
𝑥
−
𝑟
x−r, giving a quadratic.

Solve the resulting quadratic using factoring, completing the square, or quadratic formula.

Step 5: Special Cubic Formulas (Optional)

If the cubic cannot be factored easily, Cardano’s formula can solve any cubic, but it’s rarely used in basic algebra; factoring is usually sufficient.

Step 1: Try Rational Roots

Apply Rational Root Theorem as before.

Step 2: Factor Out Linear or Quadratic Factors

If a root 
𝑟
r is found:

𝑥
−
𝑟
 is a factor, divide to get cubic
x−r is a factor, divide to get cubic

If two roots are found:

6. Graph Behavior of Polynomials

Polynomials can have different shapes depending on their degree and leading coefficient. Understanding their end behavior and turning points helps in graphing.

6.1 End Behavior

The end behavior describes what happens to the graph of 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) as 
𝑥
→
∞
x→∞ or 
𝑥
→
−
∞
x→−∞.

Rules for End Behavior
Degree (n)	Leading Coefficient (a_n)	End Behavior
Even	Positive	Both ends up
Even	Negative	Both ends down
Odd	Positive	Left down, right up
Odd	Negative	Left up, right down

Examples:

𝑓
(

)
=
2
𝑥
4
−
3
𝑥
3
+
…
f(x)=2x
4
−3x

𝑥
2
−

f(x)=−x
3
+5x

−1 → degree 3 (odd), leading coefficient -1 → left up, right down.

6.2 Turning Points

A turning point is where the graph changes direction (local maxima or minima).

Maximum Number of Turning Points

A polynomial of degree 
𝑛
n can have at most 
𝑛
−
1
n−1 turning points.

Examples:

Linear (
𝑛
=
1
n=1) → 0 turning points

Quadratic (
𝑛
=
2
n=2) → 1 turning point

Cubic (
𝑛
=
3
n=3) → at most 2 turning points

Quartic (
𝑛
=
4
n=4) → at most 3 turning points

6.3 Graph Shape and Multiplicity of Roots

Multiplicity of a root affects the graph at 
𝑥
=
𝑟
x=r:

Odd multiplicity → graph crosses the x-axis

Even multiplicity → graph touches but doesn’t cross the x-axis

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
(
𝑥
−
1
)
2
(
𝑥
+
2
)
f(x)=(x−1)
2
(x+2)

Root 
𝑥
=
1
x=1, multiplicity 2 → graph touches x-axis at 1

Root 
𝑥
=
−
2
x=−2, multiplicity 1 → graph crosses x-axis at -2

6.4 Summary Steps to Sketch Polynomial Graphs

Find degree and leading coefficient → determine end behavior.

Factor polynomial → find roots and their multiplicities.

Determine turning points → max 
𝑛
−
1
n−1.

Plot x-intercepts (with multiplicities) and y-intercept (
𝑓
(
0
)
f(0)).

Sketch smooth curve through intercepts according to end behavior.

📘 Rational Functions and Asymptotes
1. Definition of Rational Functions

A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials:

𝑅
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
R(x)=
Q(x)
P(x)
	​


where 
𝑃
(

P(x) and 
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
Q(x) are polynomials, and 
𝑄
(

Note: Rational functions are undefined where the denominator is zero.

2. Vertical Asymptotes

Vertical asymptotes occur where the function approaches infinity because the denominator is zero (and the numerator is non-zero).

Rule:
If

Q(x)=0 at 
𝑥

𝑎
x=a and 
𝑃

P(a)

x=a is a vertical asymptote.

Example:

⟹
  
𝑥
=

 is a vertical asymptote
f(x)=

4. Oblique (Slant) Asymptotes

When 
deg
⁡
(
𝑃
)
=
deg
⁡
(
𝑄
)
+
1
deg(P)=deg(Q)+1, the rational function has a slant asymptote.

How to find it: Use polynomial long division:

𝑃

𝑥
)
𝑄

𝑥
)
=
quotient
+
remainder
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
Q(x)
P(x)
	​

=quotient+
Q(x)
remainder
	​


The quotient gives the slant asymptote.

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
+
𝑥
+
1
𝑥
−
1
f(x)=
x−1
x
2
+x+1
	​


Divide 
𝑥

+
𝑥
+
1
x
2
+x+1 by 
𝑥
−
1
x−1:

𝑥

𝑥

)
(
𝑥

)

+x+1=(x+2)(x−1)+3

So slant asymptote: 
𝑦

y=x+2

5. Intercepts

𝑥
x

y-intercept: Set 
𝑥

𝑓

📘 Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
1. Vertical Asymptotes

Definition:
A vertical asymptote is a vertical line 
𝑥
=
𝑎
x=a where the function grows without bound (
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
→
∞
f(x)→∞ or 
−
∞
−∞).

How to find them:

Take a rational function 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
f(x)=
Q(x)
P(x)
	​

.

Set the denominator equal to zero: 
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
=
0
Q(x)=0.

Solve for 
𝑥
x.

Any solution where the numerator is not also zero is a vertical asymptote.

Example:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
+
1
𝑥
−
3
f(x)=
x−3
x+1
	​


Denominator:

(Check the sign of numerator and denominator on each side.)

2. Horizontal Asymptotes

Definition:
A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line 
𝑦
=
𝑐
y=c that the function approaches as 
𝑥
→
∞
x→∞ or 
𝑥
→
−

A rational function can have multiple vertical asymptotes but at most one horizontal asymptote.


📘 Holes in Graphs of Rational Functions
Definition:

A hole is a point on the graph where the function is undefined, but the discontinuity is removable. In other words, the graph “skips” that point instead of going to infinity.

Holes occur when a factor cancels from both numerator and denominator.

How to Find Holes

Factor the numerator and denominator completely.

Look for common factors that appear in both numerator and denominator.

Set the common factor equal to zero to find the x-coordinate of the hole.

Plug this x-value into the simplified function (after canceling the factor) to find the y-coordinate.

Example 1:
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
(
𝑥
−
2
)
(
𝑥
+
3
)
(
𝑥
−
2
)
(
𝑥
−

)
f(x)=
(x−2)(x−5)
(x−2)(x+3)
	​


Step 1: Factor check

Common factor: 
𝑥
−

x−2 appears in numerator and denominator.

Step 2: Identify x-coordinate

Set 
𝑥

⟹
  
𝑥

x−2=0⟹x=2

Always simplify the function first before identifying holes.


📘 Domain Restrictions of Rational Functions
Definition:

The domain of a function is the set of all possible x-values for which the function is defined (does not break or become undefined).

For rational functions 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑃
(
𝑥
)
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
f(x)=
Q(x)
P(x)
	​

:

The function is undefined wherever the denominator 
𝑄
(
𝑥
)
=
0
Q(x)=0.

These points may result in vertical asymptotes or holes depending on whether the factor cancels.

Steps to Find Domain Restrictions

Factor the denominator completely.

Set denominator ≠ 0.

Solve for x-values that must be excluded from the domain.

Check for cancelled factors:

If a factor cancels with the numerator → hole.

If a factor remains → vertical asymptote.

Example 1:
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
−
4
𝑥
2
−
𝑥
−
6
f(x)=
x
2
−x−6
x
2
−4
	​


Step 1: Factor numerator and denominator

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
(
𝑥
−
2
)
(
𝑥
+
2
)
(
𝑥
−
3
)
(
𝑥
+
2
)
f(x)=
(x−3)(x+2)
(x−2)(x+2)
	​


Step 2: Denominator = 0

(
𝑥
−
3
)
(
𝑥
+
2
)
=
0
  
⟹
  
𝑥
=
3
 or 
𝑥
=
−
2
(x−3)(x+2)=0⟹x=3 or x=−2

Step 3: Identify holes vs vertical asymptotes

𝑥
=
−
2
x=−2 → cancels → hole

𝑥
=
3
x=3 → remains → vertical asymptote

Step 4: Domain

Domain: 
𝑥
∈
𝑅
,
  
𝑥

−

(
𝑥
−
3
)
(
𝑥
+
3
)
g(x)=
(x−3)(x+3)
x+5
	​


Step 2: Denominator ≠ 0

⟹
  
𝑥





Step 3: No cancellation

No common factors → both are vertical asymptotes.

Step 4: Domain

Domain: 
𝑥
∈
𝑅
,
  
𝑥
≠
−
3
,
3
Domain: x∈R,x

=−3,3
Key Points:

Always check the denominator: any x that makes it zero is excluded.

Canceled factors → holes, uncanceled → vertical asymptotes.

Domain is all real numbers except restricted x-values.


📘 Applications of Rational Functions in Real-World Modeling
1. Physics – Motion and Resistance

Example: Velocity of a falling object with air resistance can be modeled as:

𝑣
(
𝑡
)
=
𝑚
𝑔
𝑏
(
1
−
𝑒
−
𝑏
𝑚
𝑡
)
v(t)=
b
mg
	​

(1−e
−
m
b
	​

t
)

Here, the denominator often represents resistance factors. Domain restrictions arise because certain time values may be physically impossible (e.g., negative time).

Vertical asymptotes can indicate situations where velocity approaches infinity theoretically (like singularities in idealized models).

2. Chemistry – Reaction Rates

Michaelis-Menten Equation for enzyme kinetics:

𝑣
=
𝑉
max
⁡
[
𝑆
]
𝐾
𝑚
+
[
𝑆
]
v=
K
m
	​

+[S]
V

[S]
	​


Domain restriction: Substrate concentration 
[
𝑆

−
𝐾
𝑚
[S]

=−K
m
	​

 (though in practice 
[
𝑆
]
>
0
[S]>0)

Interpretation: The reaction rate can never reach infinite values because the denominator ensures a horizontal asymptote at 
𝑣
=
𝑉
max
⁡
v=V
max
	​

.

3. Economics – Cost and Revenue Models

Example: Average cost per unit:

𝐶
(
𝑥
)
=
𝐹
+
𝑉
𝑥
𝑥
=
𝐹
𝑥
+
𝑉
C(x)=

F+Vx
	​

=
x
F
	​

+V

𝐹
F = fixed costs, 
𝑉
V = variable cost per unit, 
𝑥
x = number of units produced.

Domain restriction: 
𝑥
>
0
x>0 (cannot produce zero or negative items).

Asymptotic behavior: As production increases, 
𝐹
𝑥
→
0
x
F
	​

→0, showing economies of scale.

4. Engineering – Structural Stress

Stress on a beam under load can sometimes be modeled as:

𝜎
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑃
𝐴
−
𝑘
𝑥
σ(x)=
A−kx
P
	​


𝑃
P = load, 
𝐴
A = cross-sectional area, 
𝑘
k = material constant, 
𝑥
x = position along beam

Domain restriction: 
𝐴
−
𝑘
𝑥
≠
0
  
⟹
  
𝑥
≠
𝐴
𝑘
A−kx

=0⟹x

=
k
A
	​


Interpretation: Vertical asymptote signals a theoretical failure point of the material.

5. Population Dynamics – Ecology

Rational functions can model population growth with limiting factors:

𝑃
(
𝑡
)
=
𝐾
1
+
𝐴
𝑒
−
𝑟
𝑡
P(t)=
1+Ae
−rt
K
	​


𝐾
K = carrying capacity, 
𝐴
A = constant, 
𝑟
r = growth rate

Domain: 
𝑡
∈
𝑅
t∈R (time)

Horizontal asymptote: Population approaches carrying capacity 
𝐾
K.

Key Takeaways

Domain restrictions correspond to impossible or undefined real-world situations (like division by zero).

Vertical asymptotes often represent thresholds, failure points, or singularities.

Holes usually indicate temporary exclusions or values that cancel out in real-world formulas.

Rational functions are powerful tools in physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and engineering.

6. Advantages of Cramer’s Rule

Systematic and easy for small systems (2×2 or 3×3).

Gives exact solution using determinants.

1. Word Problems

Word problems often translate a real-world scenario into a system of equations.

Example:

A farmer has chickens and cows. There are 20 animals in total, and they have 56 legs altogether. How many chickens and cows are there?

Step 1: Define variables

Let 
𝑥
=
x= number of chickens

Let 
𝑦
=
y= number of cows

Step 2: Translate into equations

Total animals:

𝑥
+
𝑦
=
20
x+y=20

Total legs:

2
𝑥
+
4
𝑦
=
56
2x+4y=56
Step 3: Solve the system

We can use substitution or elimination.

From 
𝑥
+
𝑦
=
20
x+y=20, we have 
𝑥
=
20
−
𝑦
x=20−y

Substitute into 
2
𝑥
+
4
𝑦
=
56
2x+4y=56:

2
(
20
−
𝑦
)
+
4
𝑦
=
56
40
−
2
𝑦
+
4
𝑦
=
56
2
𝑦
=
16
𝑦
=
8
2(20−y)+4y=56
40−2y+4y=56
2y=16
y=8

Then 
𝑥
=
20
−
8
=
12
x=20−8=12

✅ Answer: 12 chickens, 8 cows

2. Optimization Problems Using Systems

Sometimes you want to maximize or minimize a quantity subject to constraints. Systems of equations often appear in linear programming problems.

Example:

A factory makes two products, A and B.

Each unit of A takes 2 hours of labor and 3 kg of material.

Each unit of B takes 1 hour of labor and 2 kg of material.

Total labor available: 100 hours

Total material available: 120 kg

Profit per unit: A = $30, B = $20

Goal: Maximize profit.

Step 1: Define variables

Let 
𝑥
=
x= units of A

Let 
𝑦
=
y= units of B

Step 2: Write constraints as equations/inequalities

Labor: 
2
𝑥
+
𝑦
≤
100
2x+y≤100

Material:

Step 4: Solve

Solve the inequalities system to find feasible region (graphically or via substitution).

Check the vertices of the feasible region to find maximum profit (this is standard linear programming).

This is a direct application of systems of equations to real-world optimization.


1. Compound Inequalities

A compound inequality combines two simple inequalities using and or or.

a) “And” Inequalities

Both conditions must be true.

Solution is the overlap of the two inequalities.

Example:

2
<
𝑥
+
1
≤
5
2<x+1≤5

Step 1: Solve each part

2
<
𝑥
+
1
  
⟹
  
𝑥
>
1
2<x+1⟹x>1
𝑥
+
1
≤
5
  
⟹
  
𝑥
≤
4
x+1≤5⟹x≤4

Step 2: Combine

1
<
𝑥
≤
4
1<x≤4

✅ Solution: All numbers between 1 and 4, not including 1 but including 4.

Graphically: Open circle at 1, closed circle at 4, shading in between.

b) “Or” Inequalities

Either condition can be true.

Solution is the union of the two inequalities.

Example:

𝑥
−
3
<
−
1
or
𝑥
+
2
>
5
x−3<−1orx+2>5

Step 1: Solve each inequality

𝑥
−
3
<
−
1
  
⟹
  
𝑥
<
2
x−3<−1⟹x<2
𝑥
+
2
>
5
  
⟹
  
𝑥
>
3
x+2>5⟹x>3

Step 2: Combine

𝑥
<
2
or
𝑥
>
3
x<2orx>3

✅ Solution: Numbers less than 2 or greater than 3.

Graphically: Shade left of 2 and right of 3, leaving a gap in between.

2. Absolute Value Inequalities

Absolute value represents distance from 0, so inequalities involve two cases.

a) “Less than”
∣
𝑥
∣
<
𝑎
  
⟹
  
−
𝑎
<
𝑥
<
𝑎
∣x∣<a⟹−a<x<a

Example:

∣
𝑥
−
2
∣
<
5
∣x−2∣<5

Step 1: Remove absolute value

−
5
<
𝑥
−
2
<
5
−5<x−2<5

Step 2: Solve for 
𝑥
x

−
3
<
𝑥
<
7
−3<x<7

✅ Solution: Numbers between -3 and 7 (not including endpoints if < sign).

b) “Greater than”
∣
𝑥
∣
>
𝑎
  
⟹
  
𝑥
<
−
𝑎
or
𝑥
>
𝑎
∣x∣>a⟹x<−aorx>a

Example:

∣
2
𝑥
+
1
∣
>
7
∣2x+1∣>7

Step 1: Remove absolute value

2
𝑥
+
1
<
−
7
or
2
𝑥
+
1
>
7
2x+1<−7or2x+1>7

Step 2: Solve each part

2
𝑥
<
−
8
  
⟹
  
𝑥
<
−
4
2x<−8⟹x<−4
2
𝑥
>
6
  
⟹
  
𝑥
>
3
2x>6⟹x>3

✅ Solution: 
𝑥
<
−
4
x<−4 or 
𝑥
>
3
x>3

3. Applications

Distance problems: |x - a| < b → x is within b units of a.

Tolerance problems: Measurements must be within a certain range.

Finance: Maximum/minimum thresholds, e.g., budgets or allowable error margins.


Graphing Inequalities in the Coordinate Plane

An inequality in two variables, like 
𝑦
<
2
𝑥
+
3
y<2x+3, represents a region of the plane rather than a single line.

1. Steps to Graph a Linear Inequality

Take 
𝑦
≤
2
𝑥
+
3
y≤2x+3 as an example:

Step 1: Graph the boundary line

Replace the inequality with an equals sign: 
𝑦
=
2
𝑥
+
3
y=2x+3.

This is a straight line.

Step 2: Choose solid or dashed line

≤ or ≥ → solid line (points on the line are included).

< or > → dashed line (points on the line are not included).

Step 3: Test a point

Pick a point not on the line, e.g., 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0).

Substitute into the inequality:

0
≤
2
(
0
)
+
3
  
⟹
  
0
≤
3
 ✅ true
0≤2(0)+3⟹0≤3 ✅ true

Shade the region containing the test point.

Step 4: Shade the correct half-plane

All solutions of the inequality lie in the shaded region.

2. Graphing Compound Inequalities

“And” inequalities: Shade the overlap of the two regions.

Example:

𝑦
≥
𝑥
+
1
and
𝑦
<
3
𝑥
−
2
y≥x+1andy<3x−2

Graph both lines (solid for ≥, dashed for <).

Shade the region where the two shaded areas intersect.

“Or” inequalities: Shade any region that satisfies at least one of the inequalities.

3. Absolute Value Inequalities in 2D

Absolute value inequalities form V-shaped regions or bands.

Example 1:

∣
𝑦
−
𝑥
∣
≤
2
∣y−x∣≤2

Rewrite as a compound inequality:

−
2
≤
𝑦
−
𝑥
≤
2
  
⟹
  
𝑥
−
2
≤
𝑦
≤
𝑥
+
2
−2≤y−x≤2⟹x−2≤y≤x+2

Graph the boundary lines: 
𝑦
=
𝑥
−
2
y=x−2 (solid), 
𝑦
=
𝑥
+
2
y=x+2 (solid).

Shade between the two lines.

Example 2:

∣
𝑥
∣
+
∣
𝑦
∣
≤
4
∣x∣+∣y∣≤4

Forms a diamond-shaped region.

Represents all points within distance 4 from the origin along axes.

4. Applications

Feasible regions in optimization (linear programming).

Physical constraints: e.g., area where an object can move.

Tolerance zones: e.g., manufacturing limits for x and y dimensions.

Applications of Inequalities and Absolute Value in Real-World Constraints

Inequalities often describe limits, boundaries, and feasible solutions. Absolute value adds the idea of distance or deviation from a target.

1. Budget and Resource Limits

Scenario: A company produces chairs and tables.

Let 
𝑥
=
x= chairs, 
𝑦
=
y= tables.

Budget limits:

50
𝑥
+
80
𝑦
≤
2000
50x+80y≤2000

Graph the inequality. The shaded region shows all production combinations that stay under budget.

Note: This is a feasible region for planning.

2. Distance Constraints

Scenario: A delivery drone must stay within 10 km of a warehouse.

Let 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y) be the drone’s location relative to the warehouse at (0,0).

𝑥
2
+
𝑦
2
≤
10
x
2
+y
2
	​

≤10

Graphing: A circle of radius 10 shows the area the drone can operate in.

Absolute value variations:

∣
𝑥
∣
+
∣
𝑦
∣
≤
10
∣x∣+∣y∣≤10

Forms a diamond-shaped area—used in grid-based navigation.

3. Manufacturing Tolerances

Scenario: Parts must be within ±0.5 mm of a target size:

∣
𝑥
−
10
∣
≤
0.5
∣x−10∣≤0.5

All acceptable sizes are in the interval [9.5, 10.5].

Visualized as a band or strip if plotting two variables.

4. Environmental and Safety Constraints

Example: Pollution levels:

Let 
𝑥
=
x= chemical A, 
𝑦
=
y= chemical B.

Safety limits:

𝑥
+
2
𝑦
≤
100
x+2y≤100

The feasible region shows safe combinations of chemical levels.

5. Optimization and Linear Programming

Inequalities define feasible regions for maximizing or minimizing objectives.

Example: Maximize profit subject to:

𝑥
≥
0
,
𝑦
≥
0
,
3
𝑥
+
2
𝑦
≤
120
x≥0,y≥0,3x+2y≤120

The intersection of these inequalities is where solutions are allowed.

✅ Key Takeaways:

Inequalities = limits or constraints.

Absolute value = tolerance, distance, or deviation.

Graphing regions = visualizing all possible solutions.

Essential for engineering, economics, logistics, and physics.

Simplifying Radical Expressions

A radical expression involves a root, usually a square root (
  
	​

) or higher (
  
𝑛
n
	​

). Simplifying means rewriting it in its simplest form.

1. Simplifying Square Roots
Step 1: Factor the radicand (number inside the root)

Break the number into perfect squares and other factors.

72
=
36
⋅
2
72
	​

=
36⋅2
	​

Step 2: Separate the root
36
⋅
2
=
36
⋅
2
=
6
2
36⋅2
	​

=
36
	​

⋅
2
	​

=6
2
	​


✅ Simplest form: 
6

	​


Step 3: Apply the same to variables

For example:

50
𝑥

𝑦
3
=
25
⋅

2. Key Parameters

Amplitude (
𝑎
a)

The maximum distance from the midline.

∣
𝑎
∣
∣a∣ determines how “tall” the wave is.

Sine/Cosine only. Tangent has no amplitude.

Period (
𝑇
T)

The length of one full cycle.

Sine/Cosine: 
𝑇

π
	​


Phase Shift (
𝑐
/
𝑏
c/b)

Horizontal shift left/right.

Vertical Shift (
𝑑
d)

Moves the midline up or down.

3. Sine and Cosine Graphs

Sine: Starts at midline, rises to maximum, falls to minimum, returns to midline.

Cosine: Starts at maximum (or minimum if 
𝑎
<
0
a<0), then falls/rises like a wave.

Example:

𝑦
=
2
sin
⁡
(
3

12
π/12 right

Midline = 
𝑦
=
1
y=1

4. Tangent Graph

Repeats every 
𝜋
/
𝑏
π/b units.

Vertical asymptotes where 
cos
⁡
(
𝑏
𝑥
−
𝑐
)
=
0
cos(bx−c)=0 (denominator of 
tan
⁡
=
sin
⁡
/
cos
⁡
tan=sin/cos)

Crosses midline at the origin of the cycle.

Steep slope near asymptotes.

5. Steps to Graph

Identify amplitude, period, phase shift, vertical shift.

Draw the midline (for sine/cosine).

Mark key points for one period: max, min, midline crossings.

Sketch the wave smoothly.

For tangent: plot asymptotes first, then midline crossing.

Repeat for additional periods if needed.
