when was the number i as the square root of -1 invented?
ChatGPT said:

The concept of 
𝑖
=
−
1
i=
−1
	​

 didn’t appear fully formed—it evolved over several centuries. Here’s the historical progression:

16th Century (1500s) – Italian mathematicians like Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) were solving cubic equations and sometimes encountered square roots of negative numbers. Cardano treated them as “impossible” or formal symbols without real meaning.

17th Century (1600s) – Mathematicians like Rafael Bombelli (1526–1572) began to systematize rules for working with these “imaginary numbers,” treating them more formally in algebra. Bombelli even gave rules for manipulating expressions like 
−
1
−1
	​

.

18th Century (1700s) – Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) introduced the notation 
𝑖
i for 
−
1
−1
	​

 explicitly and showed how it could be used in formulas like 
𝑒
𝑖
𝜃
e
iθ
, linking it to trigonometry.

19th Century (1800s) – Carl Friedrich Gauss and others developed the complex plane, giving 
𝑖
i a clear geometric interpretation as a 90° rotation in the plane. This made imaginary numbers widely accepted in mathematics.

So, the symbol 
𝑖
i and its rigorous use as 
−
1
−1
	​

 really became standard in the 1700s with Euler, although the “idea” had been floating around since the 1500s.

If you want, I can make a short timeline of the key milestones for 
𝑖
i—it’s pretty fascinating. Do you want me to do that?

The mathematicians who first encountered 
𝑖
=
−
1
i=
−1
	​

 weren’t trying to invent imaginary numbers for fun—they stumbled on them while solving very concrete algebra problems. Here’s the story:

1. Solving Cubic Equations (16th century)

Mathematicians involved: Gerolamo Cardano, Scipione del Ferro, Niccolò Tartaglia

Problem: Find solutions to cubic equations of the form

𝑥
3
+
𝑝
𝑥
+
𝑞
=
0
x
3
+px+q=0

Why 
−
1
−1
	​

 appeared:
When using the formula for the roots of a cubic, sometimes you end up taking the square root of a negative number even if the final solution is a real number. For example:

𝑥
3
=
15
𝑥
+
4
x
3
=15x+4

Using Cardano’s formula leads to an expression like:

𝑥
=
2
+
−
121
3
+
2
−
−
121
3
x=
3
2+
−121
	​

	​

+
3
2−
−121
	​

	​


Here, 
−
121
−121
	​

 has no real value—but the sum of these two cube roots actually gives a real number. This was baffling at the time.

2. Algebraic completeness

Mathematicians involved: Rafael Bombelli

Problem: Bombelli wanted to make algebra rules consistent. If you allow subtraction and division freely, negative numbers appear, and then “imaginary” numbers appear in certain calculations. He developed rules to manipulate 
−
1
−1
	​

 so you could still get correct answers.

Impact: This let mathematicians handle all possible roots of polynomials, not just the real ones.

3. Trigonometry and exponential relationships

Mathematicians involved: Euler (18th century)

Problem: Understanding relationships between exponential functions and trigonometry. Euler discovered that 
−
1
−1
	​

 was deeply connected to rotations in the plane and to formulas like:

𝑒
𝑖
𝜃
=
cos
⁡
𝜃
+
𝑖
sin
⁡
𝜃
e
iθ
=cosθ+isinθ

This allowed for elegant solutions in physics, engineering, and later electrical circuits.

4. Geometry and complex numbers

Mathematicians involved: Gauss (19th century)

Problem: How to represent all solutions of polynomials geometrically. Gauss introduced the complex plane, showing that 
𝑖
i corresponds to a 90° rotation—turning something that was “imaginary” into something visually meaningful.

In short:

Cardano and others stumbled upon 
𝑖
i while solving real cubic equations.

Bombelli formalized rules to calculate reliably with negative square roots.

Euler and Gauss made 
𝑖
i a powerful tool in trigonometry, geometry, and analysis.


Perfect! Let’s look at a classic example from Cardano that shows why 
−
1
−1
	​

 appeared even when the final solution is real.

Problem:

Solve the cubic equation:

𝑥
3
=
15
𝑥
+
4
x
3
=15x+4

We want real solutions.

Step 1: Use Cardano’s formula

For a cubic of the form 
𝑥
3
+
𝑝
𝑥
+
𝑞
=
0
x
3
+px+q=0, Cardano’s formula says:

𝑥
=
𝑞
2
+
𝑞
2
4
−
𝑝
3
27
3
+
𝑞
2
−
𝑞
2
4
−
𝑝
3
27
3
x=
3
2
q
	​

+
4
q
2
	​

−
27
p
3
	​

	​

	​

+
3
2
q
	​

−
4
q
2
	​

−
27
p
3
	​

	​

	​


Here, 
𝑝
=
−
15
p=−15 and 
𝑞
=
4
q=4 (rearranging 
𝑥
3
−
15
𝑥
−
4
=
0
x
3
−15x−4=0).

𝑥
=
2
+
(
−
121
)
3
+
2
−
(
−
121
)
3
x=
3
2+
(−121)
	​

	​

+
3
2−
(−121)
	​

	​

Step 2: Encounter 
−
121
−121
	​


−
121
=
11
𝑖
−121
	​

=11i, where 
𝑖
=
−
1
i=
−1
	​

.

So the expression becomes:

𝑥
=
2
+
11
𝑖
3
+
2
−
11
𝑖
3
x=
3
2+11i
	​

+
3
2−11i
	​


At first glance, this looks like nonsense—how can a sum of two imaginary cube roots be real?

Step 3: Cube roots of complex numbers

Using Euler’s formula or De Moivre’s theorem:

2
+
11
𝑖
=
𝑟
(
cos
⁡
𝜃
+
𝑖
sin
⁡
𝜃
)
2+11i=r(cosθ+isinθ)

𝑟
=
2
2
+
11
2
=
125
=
5
5
r=
2
2
+11
2
	​

=
125
	​

=5
5
	​


𝜃
=
arctan
⁡
(
11
2
)
θ=arctan(
2
11
	​

)

Then taking the cube root:

2
+
11
𝑖
3
=
𝑟
3
[
cos
⁡
𝜃
3
+
𝑖
sin
⁡
𝜃
3
]
3
2+11i
	​

=
3
r
	​

[cos
3
θ
	​

+isin
3
θ
	​

]

Similarly for 
2
−
11
𝑖
3
3
2−11i
	​

.

Step 4: Add them together

When you add 
2
+
11
𝑖
3
+
2
−
11
𝑖
3
3
2+11i
	​

+
3
2−11i
	​

, the imaginary parts cancel out, leaving a perfectly real number:

𝑥
=
4
x=4

✅ So the solution is real, but you had to pass through “imaginary territory” to calculate it.

This example shows why mathematicians needed 
𝑖
i: without imaginary numbers, you couldn’t consistently compute the roots of all cubics.


why did they need to compute the roots of all cubics?
ChatGPT said:

Ah! Now we’re getting to the why behind the math—this isn’t just abstract curiosity; it was deeply practical and tied to the evolution of algebra.

Here’s the reasoning step by step:

1. Polynomials were central in algebra

By the 1500s, mathematicians were studying equations systematically:

𝑥
2
+
𝑝
𝑥
+
𝑞
=
0
(quadratic)
x
2
+px+q=0(quadratic)
𝑥
3
+
𝑝
𝑥
+
𝑞
=
0
(cubic)
x
3
+px+q=0(cubic)
𝑥
4
+
𝑝
𝑥
+
𝑞
=
0
(quartic)
x
4
+px+q=0(quartic)

Quadratics were already solved in the ancient world, but cubic and quartic equations were harder. The goal was to find formulas that could solve all possible equations of these types.

2. Solving all cubics = completeness

Completeness principle: Mathematicians wanted every algebraic equation to have a solution (at least in some extended number system).

Even if you only cared about real numbers in the physical world, the formulas for roots sometimes forced you into “imaginary” numbers as intermediate steps.

If they ignored these intermediate steps, the formulas would fail sometimes, making algebra inconsistent.

3. Practical applications

Even in the 1500s, solving cubics had practical uses in:

Land measurement and architecture: Cubic equations came up when calculating volumes of irregular solids.

Commerce and finance: Problems like “If I invest this amount at this rate, how long until it triples?” could reduce to cubic equations.

Astronomy: Calculating planetary positions sometimes required solving polynomials.

So mathematicians weren’t just chasing abstract puzzles—they were developing tools to solve real-world problems, and this forced them to handle cases where negative square roots appeared.

4. Algebraic theory and elegance

Once Bombelli, Euler, and others realized that imaginary numbers could make algebra work consistently, they could:

Solve every cubic systematically

Develop a unified algebraic framework (later extended to complex numbers)

Lay the foundation for modern mathematics, including analysis and geometry

In short: They needed to compute all cubic roots to make algebra reliable and complete, even if some of those roots looked “impossible” at first. Imaginary numbers were the tool that made the system work.

Perfect! Here’s a timeline of cubic-solving breakthroughs showing exactly how 
𝑖
i came into play. I’ll keep it chronological and highlight the “aha!” moments.
