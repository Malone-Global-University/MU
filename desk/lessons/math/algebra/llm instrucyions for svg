Good grief you are confused and have it backwards. The distance is 15 city blocks. From the beginning you are the furthest away. The further away you are the more options to go right or go up. this gives more paths not less. As you get closer to the end there are less routes availible because there are less options to go right or pivot.  



I with try to explain with clear instructions.






1.The green diamond is the starting point, the red diamond is the finish. 

2. Do you see how colored line segments end? They end in the middle of an intersection where they have a choice of up or down. 

3. There are nine colored lines that travel in this order: blue, purple, yellow, orange, green, pink, red, gray, and black. 

4. Each colored line tries to follow as closely as possible the path of the line that went before it without using the same exact path and without backtracking.


5. Blue is first "traveler". It goes from 0,0 to 8,0 to 8,7. It only has 1 route. 

6. Purple is second traveler. It goes from 0,0 to 7,0 to 7,1. From there it has 7 possible routes.

7. Yellow is 3rd traveler. It goes from 0,0 to 6,0 to 6,1. From there it has 28 possible routes. Hint: "Because yellow goes from 6,1 to 7,1 is gets every route that purple had from 7,1. Every Color crosses the main interstion point for the color that traveled before it so it will get that colors number of routes plus it's own."    

8. Orange has 84 routes.

9. Green has 210.

10. Pink has 462.

11. Red has 924. 

12. Gray 1716.

13. Black 3003.


14. Adding the total number of routes the answer is: 1 + 7 + 28 + 84 + 210 + 462 + 924 + 1716 + 3003 = 6435. This is the same as 15C8 or 15C7 (8 by 7 blocks or 7 by 8 blocks both give 6435 as the correct number of routes.)
