Lesson: Understanding PEMDAS (Order of Operations)
Objective

Students will be able to correctly evaluate mathematical expressions using the order of operations (PEMDAS).

1. Introduction: Why Order Matters

Imagine youâ€™re given this math problem:
8 + 2 Ã— 5

If you add first: (8 + 2) Ã— 5 = 10 Ã— 5 = 50

If you multiply first: 8 + (2 Ã— 5) = 8 + 10 = 18

ðŸ‘‰ The same problem gave two different answers!
Math needs rules so everyone gets the same answer. Thatâ€™s where PEMDAS comes in.

2. What is PEMDAS?

PEMDAS is a way to remember the order of operations:

P â†’ Parentheses

E â†’ Exponents

M â†’ Multiplication

D â†’ Division

A â†’ Addition

S â†’ Subtraction

ðŸ”‘ Rule: Work from left to right for multiplication & division, and also left to right for addition & subtraction.

3. The Steps

Parentheses first: Solve anything inside ( ).

Exponents next: Handle powers and roots.

Multiply & Divide (from left to right).

Add & Subtract (from left to right).

4. Guided Examples
Example 1

3 + 6 Ã— 2

Parentheses? None.

Exponents? None.

Multiplication? Yes â†’ 6 Ã— 2 = 12

Addition: 3 + 12 = 15

âœ… Answer: 15

Example 2

(8 âˆ’ 3)Â²

Parentheses first â†’ (8 âˆ’ 3) = 5

Exponent â†’ 5Â² = 25
âœ… Answer: 25

Example 3

20 Ã· 5 Ã— 2

Parentheses? None

Exponents? None

Multiplication & Division â†’ work left to right
â†’ 20 Ã· 5 = 4
â†’ 4 Ã— 2 = 8
âœ… Answer: 8

5. Practice Problems

Try these on your own:

5 + (4 Ã— 3)

(12 Ã· 3) + 2Â²

18 Ã· (3 Ã— 2)

(7 + 3) Ã— (5 âˆ’ 2)

4Â² + 6 Ã— 3

6. Wrap-Up

PEMDAS makes sure everyone solves problems the same way.

Remember: Parentheses â†’ Exponents â†’ Multiply/Divide â†’ Add/Subtract.

Always work left to right for multiplication/division and addition/subtraction.
