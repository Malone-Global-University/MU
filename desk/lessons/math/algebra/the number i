What is i and where does it come from?

The symbol i is defined as

𝑖
=
−
1
i=
−1
	​


which means it is a number whose square equals –1:

𝑖
2
=
−
1
i
2
=−1

No real number has this property, since the square of any real number is always nonnegative. Mathematicians introduced i as a new kind of number to solve equations that otherwise had no solutions, such as

𝑥
2
+
1
=
0
x
2
+1=0

which becomes solvable if we allow 
𝑥
=
±
𝑖
x=±i.

Why do we use i?

Convenience in algebra: It lets us find roots of polynomials that would otherwise be impossible (e.g., quadratics with negative discriminants).

Complex numbers: Any number of the form 
𝑎
+
𝑏
𝑖
a+bi (with real numbers 
𝑎
,
𝑏
a,b) is called a complex number. These can be represented on the complex plane, where the horizontal axis is real numbers and the vertical axis is multiples of i.

Geometry & rotations: Multiplying by 
𝑖
i corresponds to a 90° rotation on the complex plane. Repeated powers of 
𝑖
i cycle every four steps:

Applications: Complex numbers appear everywhere in science and engineering — in electrical circuits, quantum mechanics, wave analysis, and computer graphics.

👉 In short: i was “invented” to make algebra more complete, giving us a way to handle square roots of negative numbers. What began as an imaginary convenience turned out to be an indispensable tool for mathematics and physics.
