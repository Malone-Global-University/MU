<li> Oval track= πh+2l.       Circumference of circle plus perimeter of rectangle.<br><br><br>

Example using 60 for height and 120 for length, round to appropriate number of digits:
Perimeter of track:       π·60+2(120)   → π60+240 →   188.49+240  →  428.496 meters</li>


<li> πr2. Measure the widest part of the circle to find the diameter then divide it in half to find the radius. Take the radius and square it then multiply by π.<br><br><br>


For entire area of track:      lw+ πr2  → 60·120+ π302  → 7200+π900 → ≈ 10,027.43 
You only have to find area of the whole circle not two individual halves, (area of rectangle +area of circle).</li></ol>

<!-- Operators -->
<div class="glossary-entry" id="operators-entry">
  <h2 class="term" onclick="toggleDefinition('operators-def')">Operators/Operations</h2>
  <div class="definition" id="operators-def">
    <p>There are six operators + – ÷ ∙ ^ √ used to perform arithmetic. 

<p>
Operators are the symbols used to indicate the operation to be performed. Operations the method of increasing or decreasing a quantity or number. Operation signs are called addition (+), subtraction (-), times or multiply (×  or ·), divide (÷), power (^ or write as exponents using superscripts), and radical (√). 
</p>
<p>
There are six main operations, each corresponding to it's own unique symbol telling how to proceed with determining a solution to a given problem. More symbols can and do exist for the same operations so there is some redundancy. These other symbols exist as a convenience so that they make reading an equation easier to do. Often the (×) is replaced in algebra with the center dot (·) so that the × sign is not confused with the variable “x”.</p>

<p>
Most if not all math symbols (called operator signs or math signs) come from earlier and archaic sources. Many times these symbols have been repurposed for many different uses. They have variant sizing, patterns, and different names. Sometimes there are different names for the different versions. Mostly used for annotating literature these older names and versions are not likely appropriate for math or proofreading anymore. They are obsolete and many people would not understand them or their purpose making them only acceptable for private use and not public consumption. You are not expected to know these or learn them. You are however expected to learn the Greek letters and symbols commonly used in math, physics, and engineering. Using archaic and obsolete symbolism will make notes messier and hard to read so their use is discouraged. In addition to learning math operators and signs it is also useful to learn keyboard shortcuts to put them in computer text software programs. These signs do not appear on modern keyboards so you but to insert them using alt shortcuts. Alt shortcuts only work on keyboards with a 10 key numerical pad so you need to invest in one if you want to be productive. Learning to insert them onto your documents and websites is handy. They can even be used in search bars and comments. To embed them in a webpage you have to use html codes and they are different but same idea as alt shortcuts. Warning: Some courses have different meanings for use!</p>

  <div class="definition" id="equation-def">
    <p>Equations are expressions containing an equals sign. If it has an equal sign it is an equation. A set or string of terms with operations that requires working to derive a solution. In Algebra equations are balanced so that two sides, a left and right, or separated by an equation sign (=). To keep the equation true you have to perform equal actions on either side or your equation will become unbalanced and therefore false.

<!-- Set -->
<div class="glossary-entry" id="set-entry">
  <h2 class="term" onclick="toggleDefinition('set-def')">Set</h2>
  <div class="definition" id="set-def">
    <p>Sets group numbers or objects together so that they are listed using parentheses to differentiate them from other data. Using parentheses like this is called set notation and is mainly a study of set theory. Set theory uses an elongated version (∈ ) of the Greek letter epsilon (ε) to denote members of a set. Members of a set are also called elements. This is used in computer science for object orientated programming (oop), writing strings, arrays, and other places where programming code deals with nested items. Sets also show up in algebra when dealing with simple linear equations and plotting coordinates on a linear graph. Groups of points, called ordered pairs [(0,1)], can be collected and placed inside set notation to display what valves are relevant or appearing for a given function or chart.</p>

<p>
For example if we have the points (0,1), (1,2), (2,3),(…), we would nest them like  {(0,1); (1,2); (2,3);(...)}. The ε means that each pair is a “member” of this set.  
</p><p>
Sets are also used in number theory and many other places in math. In spreadsheets the Greek letter sigma (Σ) is used to add. We call this summation or the summing of values inside the nested parentheticals. For example if we had Σ={1,2,3,} it would read as “the summation of {1,2,3,}” and that means that we add and get “6”.  Whether actually adding or just knowing that the values inside are to be treated as a singular value this is how sigma is used.</p><p>


Greek letters vary in meaning from branch of one mathematics to another. Uppercase epsilon looks just like the English letter E. To avoid confusion exaggerated versions are used to illustrate the meaning better. This is why ∈  is used instead of E or the regular Greek letters. Uppercase epsilon is usually for elements of a set and lower case epsilon (ε) is for denoting a small quantity. There are many uses for the Greek letters and I have included as many of them and their alt codes that I know but sometimes there will be contradictions in terms so you will have to substitute whatever you can and just improvise. If you are using eccentric notation that a reader is likely to be unfamiliar with make that clear before using ambiguous terms. It really only matters that you and your intended audience can understand what notation you are using not anybody else.

<!-- Subset -->
<div class="glossary-entry" id="subset-entry">
  <h2 class="term" onclick="toggleDefinition('subset-def')">subset</h2>
  <div class="definition" id="subset-def">
    <p> A set with a set. Infinity (∞) is the set of all numbers. All even numbers are a subset of ∞. All even numbers ending with zero are a subset of that set. All even numbers ending with zero under 100 are a deeper nested subset still. A subset would be a level below a superset. <br><br>


For example: ∈ {+∞ (2,4,6...(10,20,30...100,110,120...(10,20...90)))}. 
<br><br>

This shows that within positive infinity (as denoted by the +) a subset exists that contains the set of infinite positive even numbers (as denoted by the ellipsis (…)). Then exists all positive even tens, finally there exists a set of even tens that ends at 90.  </p>

To remove parenthetical terms you must use multiplication by the factor outside the parentheses, in this case “a”. If there is no factor then multiply by “1” to cancel the parentheses. If there is a minus sign infront of the parenthetical then you must multiply every term inside by –1. This inverts all signs of the terms (sign flipping) changing them to there additive inverses: 5(x+2) = 5x+10   –5(x+2) = –5x – 2     –(5x+3x–4) becomes –5x–3x+4.</p>

In arguments a point is a logical conclusion. Two or more points that co-linear creates a “line of thought”. 
If points are not colinear then the person is “going off on a tangent”. A tangent line touches another line forming a 90° vertex so that a tangent is going off track from the original direction at the fastest rate possible (∞). If two lines of thought intersect at a vertex that point called the “solution” to a “system of equations”. In conflict two opposing lines of thought that intersect have a solution that represents compromise both parties can and will agree to. A parabola is a curved line forming an elliptical vertex given x2. There are different symbolic interpretations but either building a base for your case using x2 to represent area in 2 dimensions or approaching a problem from two different angles which share symmetry and meet at the vertex as a conclusion. The former is easy to apply the latter represents teamwork or independently coming to the same conclusion from different points or using proof to confirm a suspected idea. A cubic is 3d so is a solid block of evidence. Giving someone the third degree involves invasive questioning to gather as much evidence as possible. Depending on the quantity and quality of the evidence a verdict is reached. Side note a vertex represents a corner of 90° – θ where theta can be 0°<θ<90°. </p><p>


Verdict and vertex share Latin roots. Ver-dict is “90° diction” of a decision meaning two points of view of complete opposite rotation meet at a single conclusion: yes or no, guilty or innocent. Start at the meeting point and work backwards. You have two rays forming a 90° angle and extend to – ∞ for x and ∞ for y. These are complete opposite axes at there furthest points, one a positive and the other a negative corresponding to yes~innocent or no~guilty. Ver-tex is lesser important but refers to the crossing of lines to make letters of the alphabet stemming from Phoenician cuneiform the precursor to Latin. Versed is 90° and tex is text meaning writing as in context which means “with text” or the other writing that goes with previous writing to explain it. Context is always the definition as it defines or illustrates the picture,  which is a graph made from points. On a different note a song has “verses” which is “rounds” of singing representing a rotation in degrees from end of line to end of line making an arc angle till angles added to 360°, the Greeks represented music mathematically in their cults, too much to surmise here. Note here is a double ontaundre (french for tangent because I am going off on a tangent completely changing points) because note can refer to music or prose) Compare verses with the homophone versus. Verses means lyrics referring to bullion writing which turns and twists down the page and versus is two competing objects, in math versus is the battle between the ratio x:y of a function. Ratios rotate like gear ratios or credit/debit ratios i.e. revolving credit and capitalizing versus expensing.) Explore more subjects like foreign language, engineering, music theory, and finance. </p><p>

You have a “overturned verdict” which is a complex rotation of degree 4 meaning an inverse function where x and y are swapped making no~guilty becomes yes~innocent and vise versa. A “snap verdict” where a line of thought P1→P2→P4 = A→B→D where you have a hole in your argument at point C. Holes in your argument (also called logic) are gaps or leaps of faith that lead to illogical rational and bad policy. Of course a hole in a function is given by dividing by 0 creating a domain error at that point. There are many other figures of speech using verdict that are logical in directly mathematical way because that is how legal terminology originated. </p><p>

Compare with “sur” which means to cover as in a surjective function (many-to-one). Verse is to turn sur is to cover, as in surreptitiously (cover a topic exhaustively).

<!-- Operators -->
<div class="glossary-entry" id="Operators/Operations-entry">
  <h2 class="term" onclick="toggleDefinition('-def')">Operators/Operations</h2>
  <div class="definition" id="Operators/Operations-def">
    <p>There are six operators + – ÷ ∙ ^ √ used to perform arithmetic.</p> 

<p>
Operators are the symbols used to indicate the operation to be performed. Operations the method of increasing or decreasing a quantity or number. Operation signs are called addition (+), subtraction (-), times or multiply (×  or ·), divide (÷), power (^ or write as exponents using superscripts), and radical (√). 
</p>
<p>
There are six main operations, each corresponding to it's own unique symbol telling how to proceed with determining a solution to a given problem. More symbols can and do exist for the same operations so there is some redundancy. These other symbols exist as a convenience so that they make reading an equation easier to do. Often the (×) is replaced in algebra with the center dot (·) so that the × sign is not confused with the variable “x”.
</p>
<p>
Most if not all math symbols (called operator signs or math signs) come from earlier and archaic sources. Many times these symbols have been repurposed for many different uses. They have variant sizing, patterns, and different names. Sometimes there are different names for the different versions. Mostly used for annotating literature these older names and versions are not likely appropriate for math or proofreading anymore. They are obsolete and many people would not understand them or their purpose making them only acceptable for private use and not public consumption. You are not expected to know these or learn them. You are however expected to learn the Greek letters and symbols commonly used in math, physics, and engineering. Using archaic and obsolete symbolism will make notes messier and hard to read so their use is discouraged. In addition to learning math operators and signs it is also useful to learn keyboard shortcuts to put them in computer text software programs. These signs do not appear on modern keyboards so you but to insert them using alt shortcuts. Alt shortcuts only work on keyboards with a 10 key numerical pad so you need to invest in one if you want to be productive. Learning to insert them onto your documents and websites is handy. They can even be used in search bars and comments. To embed them in a webpage you have to use html codes and they are different but same idea as alt shortcuts. Warning: Some courses have different meanings for use!
