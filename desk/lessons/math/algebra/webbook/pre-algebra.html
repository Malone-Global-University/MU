<h2>operations</h2>

<p>There are four operations in pre-algebra called addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Algebra adds two more operations called exponentiation, radicalization. Together these six operations are called arithmetic. Arithmetic means adding numbers. It is the beginning of all math. Algebra does more than add numbers, it takes numbers and organizes them by using variables, performing functions, graphing, and using formulas.</p>

<p>The six operations have symbols called operators telling you what operation to do. Every operation has an opposite operation called its reciprocal operation. The word reciprocal and inverse almost mean the same thing but are used slightly differently depending on context. In general all math from arithmetic to calculus is just adding numbers. Here is a table to show some language and what symbol to use:</p>

<p>Every operation has an inverse operation that takes the answer and works backwards to get the starting number. This can be used to check your work. Checking your work can be used to prove you are correct. Later in geometry you will be asked to show formal proofs. </p>

<p>Addition is adding numbers: 2+3 = 5<br>   
Multiplication is adding groups of numbers: 2∙3 = 3+3 = 6 <br>
Powering is adding groups of groups of the same numbers:  23= 2∙2∙2 = 2+2+2+2 = 8<br><br><br>

Subtraction is adding negative numbers to  positive or negative numbers: –2+7 = 7–2   and –2–7 = –7–2<br>
Division is subtracting numbers by groups:   35/7 = 5   because   35–5–5–5–5–5–5–5 = 5.<br>
Rooting is dividing by groups:    2√9=3    because    9÷3=3   while    3√27 = 3    because    27÷3÷3 = 3

<h2>The numberline</h2>

<p>The numberline is the most important tool in math for counting. It is used to build other counting tools late like the Cartesian plane, unit circle and others. A number line has numbers on it evenly spaced like a ruler. The little lines that point to the number are called “tick marks” or “graduations”. A number line can have as many or as few numbers as you want. Since we can have negative numbers they can be on the line as well. A number line showing numbers from –7 to 7 is shown below: </p>

<p>If we are adding numbers like 2 + 3 = 5 we use plus sign “+”. The numbers being added are called addends or sums, the number is called the sum or total. The opposite of addition is called subtraction. Addition and subtraction are reciprocal operations of each other. Here is a short proof: 2+2 =4 because 4 – 2 = 2. Teachers call this “proving your work”. When we work backwards from the answer to the starting number this is called “working backwards”. </p>

<p>We use the reciprocal operation to work backwards. Starting with the answer 4 use the opposite of “+” sign and instead use “–” sign. We subtract 2 away instead of add 2. This can be shown on a number line:</p>

<p>There is a red dot at 2 and blue dot at 4. The curve shows we added “+2” units.
A number can be negative or positive. If negative we use a minus sign like this –2. 
Negative numbers are called “signed numbers” because they have a minus sign.
This shows adding in blue and subtracting in red. Adding and subtraction are inverses of each other.</p>

<p>Numbers never end so we can make a number line shorter or longer. We can even go all the way to infinity if we use a symbol for it. When we add we place a dot on the starting number and move the dot by the addend to the answer. The addend is the number we are adding. If we add 2+2=4 we place a dot at 2 and move 2 units to 4. We count until we are at the right place. Sometimes we draw a curve from the first dot to the second dot. 
There are many ways to use a number line: </p>

<section id="numberline">
<h2>Pemdas and the order of operations</h2>

<p>The basics of arithmetic are the operations, the order of operations called Pemdas, and the property laws. The acronym Pemdas states the “order of operations”. Operations must be performed in a specific order or else answers will vary. The letters stand for Parentheses, exponents, multiply and divide, addition and subtraction. Parentheses are used to group numbers to show in what order steps should be taken. Equations are solved doing the operations from Pemdas in the order stated. Math is done starting with the most left number then moving right. Something inside parentheses should be done first followed by exponents then multiplication and division, with addition and subtraction at the end. </p>


<p>Some equations have only one or all operator signs and following the correct order means that two different people will get the same answer. If there were not these rules nobody would agree on the answer. This is the same as how people agree on the order of numbers. If they didn't one person would think 7 or 4 can after 1 in counting. These rules are rules because everybody agreed on the order of numbers and the order of operations.
What is “7 –4∙2” ? The correct answer is – 1 not 6 because multiplication comes before subtraction.</p>

See how following a different order gives different answers? This is why it is important to follow correct process or your answer will be different than everybody else's, like your friends or the answers in a teacher's book. 
Please follow the order so that we all are in agreement. Addition and subtraction can always be done  interchangeably as long as you use the correct sign for negative numbers. In rare cases so can multiplication and division:

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Multiply first: (2∙3÷4)</th>
      <th>This time divide: (2∙3÷4)</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Now divide: 6÷4</td>
      <td>2∙¾ = 6/4</td>

      <td>This is correct: 1.5</td>

      <td>5 + 2    now add</td>
    </tr>

    </tbody>
      <tr>
      <td>7   this is right</td>
      <td>7   the answers are the same.</td>
    </thead>
    </tr>
     </tbody>
</table>



<p>Why does a different order work this time? Because adding and subtracting are reciprocal, that is they share reciprocity. Changing this order does not matter because they are inverses which means they act like almost the same operation. We see that subtracting a positive is the same as adding a negative like 3–1 = 3+(–1); and that dividing a whole number is the same as multiplying by a fraction such as 10/2 = 10∙½. To be clear 3–1 does not equal 1–3. This will give additive inverses 2, –2. What is implied is 3 – 1 = –1+3 = 2. This is clarified further under Counting Basics.   </p>


<p>Because + and – are inverse operations order doesn't matter. The are considered the same level. Because  ∙ and ÷ are inverse operations order doesn't matter. The are considered the same level. But we still have to do ∙ and ÷ before + and – . We state this rule as “Multiplication does not share reciprocity with addition”. The problems occur with three or more terms and you alternate level operations. Consider add and subtract as level one and multiply divide as level two. If different levels of operations are involved then you must follow Pemdas left to right.    </p>


<p>For the example 10/2 = 10∙½ dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by ½ because of fraction laws:</p>

<p>
10÷2 = 5    10∙ ½ = 10/1 ∙½ = (10∙1)/(1∙2) = 10/2 = 5   both equal 5 
</p>
<p>
In algebra rewriting an equation is called algebraic manipulation. We do this almost every problem. Four important points: </p>

<ol>
<li>If a number is outside parentheses without an operator you multiply</li>
<li>If a number is in front of a radical you multiply </li>
<li>Rooting is done during “E” in Pemdas</li>
<li>If “ – ”  is outside parentheses you flip all signs inside parentheses</li>
</ol>

<p>Point 1: For exponents radicals are obvious when to perform because they act like a grouping symbol.</p>

<p>3√4 –1    Note that 3√4 = 3∙√4.<br>
3(2) – 1    Note that √4 = 2 such that 3√4 = 3∙(2) a radical is really a ().<br>
6 – 1     Note that – 1 was not under the radical or it would have been grouped leaving 3√3<br>
5</p>


<p>Point 2: </p>

<p>Although the radical symbol “√” means to root  a number, is really a parentheses in disguise. Taking the square root of 4 gave us 2. Since a 3 was in front of √4 we needed to write 3(2). Something like 3(2) means 3∙2. If a number is outside parentheses without an operator you multiply: 3√4 = 3∙√4 = 3(2) = 3∙2 = 6.</p>



<p>Point 3: </p>


<p>There are many rules for exponents. Although Pemdas does not explicitly state when to root it is done during exponents because rooting is the reciprocal operation of powering. In fact rooting uses exponents to determine which root to take be it the square, cube, or higher root. Here is one of the parentheses rules for roots:</p>


<p>3√4 3   =   3(2)3   =   3∙43   =   3(2∙2∙2)   =    3(8)   =   3∙8   =   24</p>


<p>First find the root. Then if an exponent is outside of the parentheses power the root before doing anything else.  </p>


<p>Point 4: </p>


<p>–1∙any number = –that number.</p>


<p>This is true: – 1∙4 =  –4     Multiplying by a negative inverts the sign of the number <br>
This is true: –1(7) =  –7       The parentheses here imply multiplication<br>
This is true: –(52) =  –52      A sign outside parentheses inverts the sign of the number<br>
This is true: –(2+3–4 )  = ( –2–3+4)      The additive inverse of   2+3–4    is    –2–3+4 </p>

<p>Additive inverse means change all plus signs to minus signs and all minus signs to plus signs. We are inverting the operations and this means to reverse them so we are taking its inverse. The operations were additive so we call this type of inverse “additive inverse”.
The slang term for taking an additive inverse is “flipping signs”.</p>


<p>Multiplying a number n  by –1 creates the additive inverse for that n.<br>
We write a rule, called a formula, that uses the script letter n be mean any number.<br>
We write this rule as an equation and apply it by replacing n  the actual number we want to take the inverse of. The formula for additive inverse is:  n∙ –1 = –n. </p>


<p>Using letters to represent numbers is called variables. Variables are used to write rules called formulas. Formulas appear in algebra and every branch of math after that.</p> 
</section>

<section id="property laws">
<h2>Property Laws</h2>


<p>The Property Laws use letters like a or b or c to mean any three numbers that are not the same. Using letters in place of numbers is called using variables. Variables are very important in used in every algebra problem. In fact variables is what separates algebra from arithmetic. These laws are taken directly from the glossary at the beginning of the book.</p>


<p>Negation: Negation means reversing an operation or taking the opposite of something. Subtraction negates or is the negation of addition. By multiplying by a -1 we can negate terms of equations (indeed the entire equation itself) to be the opposite of sign of what it already is. This is useful simplifying and reducing equations to make them cleaner looking or easier to solve.</p>


<p>Properties: Properties are rules that dictate how order of operations should behave and what is permissible when reordering terms to restructure an equation. Properties show an how the numbers behave and interact with each other on a foundational level as opposed to simply solving for an answer. Understanding and having innate sense of properties shows an advanced mastery of mathematics and goes beyond superficial plugging in of values to get a result. You know how the numbers behave conceptually rather then mechanically.</p>


<p>Additive identity property: For any number a,  a+0 = a. This states that 0 does not change the value.</p>


<p>Multiplicative identity property: For any number a, a·1 = 1·a. A number times 1 is itself.</p>
<p>Multiplicative property of zero:  For any number a, a·0 = 0. This states number times zero is zero. </p>
<p>Division of zero: Division by zero is undefined. It is undefined since dividing by zero does not give us a singular value but potentially infinite values. Whereas “definition of a number” means that a number is unique, “undefined” means such a unique number either does not exist or a domain error has occurred.</p>


<h3>Properties of equality: The following properties are true for any a, b, or c. </h3>

<ul>
<li>Reflexive:  a = a. This is similar to the identity of a number.</li>
<li>Symmetric: if a = b then b = a. This just restates substitutive property twice.</li>
<li>Transitive: if a = b and b = c then a = c. Two numbers are equal if they both equal a third number</li>
<li>Substitutive: if a = b then a may be replaced by b. This allows known values to replace given variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Distributive property: For any numbers a, b, c:</p>


<p>a (b + c) = ab + ac   and    (b + c) a = ba + ca <br>
a (b – c) = ab – ac   and    (b – c) a = ba – ca     </p>



<p>To remove parenthetical terms you must use multiplication by the factor outside the parentheses, in this case “a”. If there is no factor then multiply by “1” to cancel the parentheses. If there is a minus sign in front of the parenthetical then you must multiply every term inside by –1. This inverts all signs of the terms (sign flipping) changing them to there additive inverses: 5(x+2) = 5x+10  –5(x+2) = –5x – 2     –(5x+3x–4) becomes –5x–3x+4.</p>


<p>Commutative property:  This states that the order of terms is irrelevant and moving them around does not change the answer for addition and multiplication. 2∙3/4 is same as 3∙2/4 , 2∙¾ , 3∙½.   </p>


<p>Associative property: For any numbers a, b, c (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (ab) c = a (bc). It says that if you change the grouping for + or ÷ the result is the same.</p>


<p>Addition principle: If a = b then a+c = b+c. This says if we add something to one side of an equation we must must add same amount on the other. This is main concept of algebra. What follows is any operation done on one side must be done on the other. The addition principle is shorthand for all these other instances of balancing an equation.</p>


<section id="law powers">
<h2>Law of powers</h2>

<ul>
<li>30 = 1      Any numbers raised to zero equals 1.</li>
<li>31 = 3      Any number raised by 1 equals itself.</li>
<li>32 = 9      A number squared is itself times itself. 3·3 = 9. There are two base factors.</li>
<li>33 = 27     A number cubed is three factors of itself multiplied.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>31  =  3        The exponent tells how many bases to multiply.</li>
<li>32  =  3 · 3        </li>
<li>33   =  3 · 3 ·3     </li>
<li>34  =  3 · 3 · 3 · 3  </li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes the exponent is blank and has a empty box to fill in or nth for the exponent. 2nth means number like “1st  2nd …nth” . We are saying a number in a series. If 34 = bnth and plug in b=3 and nth= 4.</p>
</section>

<section id="formula for powers">
<h3>Formula for powers:</h3>


<p>“bnth = b raised this number of times” where b is the base and nth is the power. Write b nth times and multiply to find the power of b. Power can mean either the exponent or value of b raised to the power of nth. </p>


<p>Example: If 34 = 81 then 4 is “the power 3 is raised to” or “the exponent of  3 is 4” . 81 is “the power of 34”.  </p>

<p>Using power to describe both the result and exponent is confusing; nonetheless:<br><br>
(23 · 3) =  3·2·2·2= 24 because (3,6,12,24) are multiples of 3. A multiple is repeated addition of a base number.<br>
33  =  3·3·3·3= 81 because (3,9,27,81) are powers of 3. <br>
Powers are repeated multiplication</p>


<p>Power can mean the base, exponent, entire term, or the total answer. This is ambiguous but how it is. When multiples of a number are the result of a power operation they are called powers of the base. Sometimes we say things like “100 is the square of 10” but we also say “100 is the second power of 10”.  We say 9 is a power of 3, 27 is a power of 3, 81 is a power of 3. My preference for this text:</p>


<p>34 = 81 where the base is 3, the exponent is 4, the exponential term is 34, and the power or product is 81.</p>
</section>

<section id="law of reciprocals">
<h2>The law of reciprocals</h2>


<p>For any non zero number a,   a/1 · 1/a = 1 and -a,  -a/1 · -1/a = 1. A reciprocal the number that multiplies to 1. Very generally if a number is whole then it can be written as number/1. Five can be written as 5, 5/1, or 5/1. Whole number are called integers. Integers can be written as fractions by writing them with a denominator of 1. Since this means divide by 1 we do not change the value because any number divided by 1 equals itself. The reciprocal of an integer always has a numerator of 1 since an integer always has a denominator of 1. We can say ½ is the reciprocal of 2 and 2 is the reciprocal of ½.  We are flipping the top and bottom numbers.</p>


<p>Fractions are called rationals. They are not integers so not whole numbers. The have numbers different than 1 in them. Fractions have the form numerator/denominator. The reciprocal of a fraction is denominator/numerator.</p>


<p>The reciprocal of   2/3   is   3/2. This can be generalized to a/b becomes b/a. 
To generalize means to write a formula using variables to represent all numbers that can be used. Lastly an exponent of –1 will create a reciprocal and invert your number such as  (3/2)-1 = 2/3.</p>   </section>

<section id="law of negative powers">
<h2>Law of negative powers</h2>


<p>An exponential term with positive exponent has the form base^exponent = p/1. 
If we have a negative exponent the form is base^–exponent = 1/p.
A positive exponent creates an answer. A negative exponent creates the reciprocal of this answer. A negative exponent will create a reciprocal of positive version of exponential term and  be written as 1/product.</p>


<p>You write the that the answer is written negative sign in front of the power negates the multiplication by inducing division of 1 using the the power as the divisor.  To find a negative power, write the power as a denominator with one as the numerator.   34 = ⅓-4  and 3-4 = ⅓4 as they are reciprocal.</p>


<h3>Writing exponents as the denominator with 1 as the numerator: </h3>

<p>
2-2 =   1/22    = ¼ <br>
3-1 = ⅓ <br>
3-2 = ⅑<br>
3-3 = ⅟27</p>

<p>
Negative powers are the negation of positive powers. Negation here means reversing an operation. We are not multiplying by a negative number. Powering a number means multiplying by groups, then it's negation must mean dividing by groups. This is why no power can be a negative number unless it is imaginary. ( i2 = -1).</p>
</section>


<section id="laws of negation">
<h2>Laws of negation</h2>


<p>Multiplication negates division and visa versa. A negation is an “undoing”; adding is the negation of  subtraction.</p>


<p>2· 3 = 6<br>
6 ÷ 3 = 2  or   Division undoes multiplication<br>
6 · ⅓ = 2       Multiplying by the reciprocal divides (undoing multiplication)
</p>


<p>27+3= 30<br>
30- 3 = 27 or 30 + (-3) = 27    Subtraction undoes addition or negating by adding a negative sum
</p>

<p>10+1= 11         A positive sum<br>
-(10+1) = -11       Negating a positive sum by multiplying by -1  
</p>

<p>Usually we simplify math by negating negative sums so we can add the difference. This gives the absolute value. Absolute value is always positive. Use as a positive or negative as situation warrants.</p>


<p>0–10–1 = ?     A negative series<br>
-1(0+10+1)        Writing in () to isolate negation sign on the outside<br>
0+10+1(-)         Flipping signs by multiplying each term by -1<br>
    11(-)         Summation of terms<br>
   –11            Negating the positive back to a negative so sign is not lost</p>


<p>It is important when negating problems using absolute value for ease calculation you put the minus sign in parentheses so that you do not forget the original sign of the equation. If you want to use a positive value you stop at 11(-) but you must have the sign there. If you need to convert the answer back it's original form having the sign properly isolated so you can keep track of your negations is critical.</p>


<p>93 – 100          a negative sum<br>
–(93 –100)   =  (– 93 +100)(–1)     distributing the sum out flips the signs<br>
(100 – 93)(–1)   = 7(–1)      writing as (100 – 7)(–1)  </p>


<p>Negation is useful for removing negative operators so that equations can be simplified. When all like terms are combined you change the sign of the answer to show the actual value.</p>
</section>
<section id="negagation of negative powers">
<h2>The negation of negative powers</h2>


<p>Negating a power means to turn a power into it's reciprocal. A reciprocal is what ever multiplied to it makes it equal one. The reciprocal of any whole number is it's fractional opposite. 5 shares reciprocity with ⅕ because  5 · 0.2 = 1. Written fractionally it is  5/1 · 1/5  = 5/5. Reducing by dividing by 5 makes it   1/1.  both 5/5   and  1/1  equal 1. any number divided by itself equals 1. </p>


<p>If we are undoing the negative of a power we have to use its reciprocal:</p>

<p>

1/81                    the reciprocal of  81/1
</p>


<p>81 · 1/81 = 1 so they are  reciprocal. Also note that (81/1 · 1/81) = 1. This is true for any number.</p>

<section id="law of negative factors">
<h2>The law of negative factors</h2>


<p>Negative sums having an even number of terms multiplied equals a positive sum always. For any non zero numbers -a · -b = ab. Negative sums having an odd number of terms multiplied equals a negative sum always. For any non zero numbers -a · b = -ab.</p>


<p>If you have three terms all with negative signs the two negative signs cancel out making the sum positive but the third sign negates it and your sum is negative. </p>


<p>If you have four terms with all negative signs they all cancel out making the sum positive. When two numbers have a negative sign it cancels out leaving the product positive. Each pair of negative terms cancel out their (-) so if you have an even number of negative terms the sum will always be positive. If you have an odd number of terms the sum will be negative because the last term is negating it. </p>

<section id="two neagatives">
<h2>Two negatives equal a positive</h2>

<p>You can only multiply two numbers at a time. With 5 numbers to be multiplied You start at the left of the expression and multiply the first two terms creating a new product with four left over. You multiply that with the third term creating a newer product leaving fourth and fifth term. You multiply your product with the fourth term and the product of that with the last term. This is the full meaning of the above.</p>

<p>We performed four multiplication operations using five terms which created four products. Our products were (– 3, 9, -27, 81, – 243). The first two terms canceled out the signs. Each additional operation changed the sign from positive to negative. Since we had an odd number of terms the first four canceled out the signs and the last term negated it making it a negative. The pattern alternates. Even negatives are positive, odd are negative.</p>

<h3>Do Not Multiply Different Bases By Adding Exponents</h3>


<p>4a<sup>2</sup> · 4b<sup>2</sup>  can not be simplified any further adding exponents since a  b. Since the base is different you would be grouping together different groups of groups.  4a<sup>2</sup>·4b<sup>2</sup>   = 4<sup>2</sup>a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> = 4(32) · 4(22)    not   16(ab<sup>4</sup>)   because   a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> ≠ ab<sup>4</sup>. The mistake is adding exponents of base a to base b. 4(32) · 4(22)  = 4(3∙3) · 4(2∙2) = 4(9) · 4(4) </p>

<p>
3n2 · 7n2  can simplified further since they have the same variable. If bases are different you would be grouping together different groups of groups. If the variables same they are called like terms. </p><p>


4x+4 can not be simplified further. We can write them to have the same variable but its power is 0 and it cancels making it unusable. Hence   4x1 +4x0   ≠   4x1   because 4x+4≠ 4x.   Any constant has a variable base raised to a power of 0 which makes the variable equal 1, which makes the term any constant times 1, which cancels and you are left with the original constant.

<section id="communtative property">
<h2>Commutative Property</h2>

<p>
You can rewrite equations by changing the order in which the number is listed without changing result.The commutative property for addition and subtraction:</p>

<p>
1+2+3 = 1+3+2 = 2+1+3 = 2+3+1 = 3+1+2 = 3+2+1<br>
1–2–3 = 1–3–2 = 2–1–3 = 2–3–1 = 3–1–2 = 3–2–1<br>
1∙2∙3 = 1∙3∙2   =   2∙1∙3 =   2∙3∙1 =   3∙1∙2 =   3∙2∙1</p>


<h3>Division is not commutative as changing order effects result:</h3>


1 ÷ 2 ÷ 3 ≠ 1 ÷3 ÷ 2 ≠  2 ÷1 ÷ 3 =  2 ÷ 3 ÷1 ≠  3 ÷ 1 ÷ 2 = 3 ÷ 2 ÷1
½ ÷ 3      ≠       1/3 ÷ 2    ≠ 2 ÷ 3   = 2/3 ÷ 1    ≠  3 ÷ 2       =       1.5 ÷1
1/6        =         1/6      ≠        2/3           =  2/3         ≠        1.5        =        1.5

<p>
Of the six combinations we get three different answers. Because 1 cancels out  when used as a denominator using a number other than 1 will give six different answers. Using 0 or 1 in proofs often is a bad way to check validity of an answer. Use numbers 2 and higher. You can commute exponential terms and radicals  because they are simplified as constants, unless division operators come into conflict. If the division operator is present nothing can be moved to the left or right of it but anything on the left can be moved anywhere on the left and anything on the right can be moved on the right:</p>

<ul>
<li>2∙ √3 + 82 ÷ 4 – 23 ∙ 5       We have all operators present </li>
<li>2∙ √3 + 82 ÷ 4 – 23 ∙ 5       The blue is left and the red is right of the obelus </li>
<li>(2∙ √3 + 82 )÷ (4 – 23 ∙ 5)   Group using parentheses</li>
<li>2∙ √3 + 8^2 / 4 – 2^3 ∙ 5     Or write as a fraction</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a fraction everything left is the numerator and everything right is the denominator. It is easier to perform this calculation using parentheses but writing as a fraction shows you how division keeps things separate. The numerator (or LH) can be rewritten in different orders up to 3 ways : </p>


2 ∙ √3 + 82 = √3 ∙ 2 + 82 = 82 + √3∙ 2    

<p>
Because PEMA still applies we must do multiplication before the addition, as such there is no other way to re-order the terms. If we only had multiplication or addition only then we could have 6 re-orderings.</p>


(2√3) ∙ 82 =  2 ∙ 82 ∙ √3 =   64 ∙ 2 ∙ √3 = 128√3   


<p>Find 82, multiply by 2, write as coefficient of √3. Changing order does nothing to change the order of operations. </p>


<h2>The Associative Property </h2>

<p>
The associative property says you can perform the operations in different orders and still get same answer.</p>

<p>
1. The associative property of addition says you can add in any order<br>
2. The associative property of multiplication says you can multiply in any order
</p>

2+3+4           
(2+3)+4 we can group the first two numbers or      2+(3+4)  we can group the last two numbers 
5+4                     2+7   
9                     9 

<p>
Whether we group the first two or last two numbers the answer is still the same. <br>
This will be true for any addition problem in that how you group terms does not change the result. Because of this addition is said be to associative. </p>


<h3>Multiplication is also associative:  2∙3∙4 can be (2∙3)∙4 or 2∙(3∙4)      </h3>


2∙3∙4    =    2∙3∙4     
(2∙3)∙4  =    2∙(3∙4)
6∙4       =    2∙12
24        =    24   


<p>In general the associative property says that how you group addition or multiplication does not change result. The reason being deals with PEMDAS and the order of operations. For any operation and it's reciprocal operation math is associative. Math is not associative when you have operations that are not reciprocal such + or –  with ∙ or </p>

<ul>
<li>Addition is reciprocal with subtraction</li>
<li>Multiplication is reciprocal with division</li>
<li>Exponentiation is reciprocal with radicalization</li>
</ul>

<p>PEMDAS says order matters, associativity appears to say order does not matter. 
More correctly associativity should use the word “group or grouping” rather than the word “order”. PEMDAS out ranks any property law, its order must be strictly adhered.
The only time PEMDAS appears to be broken is when performing a reciprocal operation.
We can't really talk about associative property without talking about PEMDAS and order of operations. </p>

<p>PEMDAS lists the order of operations, the discreet separate operations. Parentheses are always the first operation to do. What associativity does is not say order does not matter but that you can change how things are grouped. In other words parentheses always come first (according to PEMDAS) but you can change where the parentheses are ( according to associativity).Some people politely point out that sometimes it is okay to break the order of PEMDAS like 2∙3÷4 where they state you can divide first instead of multiplying. Well done. They are reciprocal operations and therefore both multiplication.</p>


<p>[2] Using PEMA over PEMDAS is preferred by some teachers because illustrates the reciprocity of same level operations. PEMA is superior but PEMDAS is what is easier to learn. PEMA is necessary because it teaches reciprocal operations and does so in a concise manner. </p>


<ul>
<li>Parentheses</li>
<li>Exponents and radicals</li>
<li>Multiply and divide</li>
<li>Add and subtract </li>
</ul>

<p>PEMDAS uses six letters to state five operations and does not show reciprocity while PEMA uses four letters to state six operations and does show reciprocity. PEMA uses to less letters, includes radicals[4], and shows reciprocity. This makes PEMA better than PEMDAS for three reasons.</p>


<p>Always do parentheses first (or any other grouping symbol).Consider a operation and its reciprocal “on the same level” and essentially to be the same operation therefore you can do them in alternate orders (not “any” order). Saying “any order” tends to confuse people and lose track of the correct order of operations. Without order of operations complex equations would have more than one answer, which is incorrect, and people would differ on the result leading to math being nonfunctional[5]. How should we do this problem: 2∙3÷4</p>


2∙3÷4   2∙3÷4
6÷4     2∙¾   
1.5     1.5


<p>There are two operation “∙” and  “÷”, whichever one we perform first we get the same result.
A dumb way to say this is “because ∙ and ÷ are the same operation. Close but inaccurate. This is the same inaccuracy as saying taking a square root is the same as exponents[6] in that is shows a lack of fundamental understanding. A more accurate response is that ∙ and ÷ are reciprocal and alternate orders of performing them are possible because reciprocity allows it. A closer look:</p>


2∙3÷4     2∙3÷4     2∙3÷4
2∙3∙¼     2∙¾       6/4
2∙¾       2∙3/2∙2   3/2
6/4       3/2       1.5
1.5
1.5



<p>There are different ways to perform this but all follow the same order of operations whether you call it PEMDAS BODMAS, BIDMAS, PEMA or whatever. The point is the result is the same. Calling multiplication the same as division is an inaccuracy because it isn't the “same” it is the reciprocal and reciprocal means the “opposite”. Same does not mean opposite. Reciprocal operations are antonyms NOT synonyms. Likewise exponents are NOT the same as radicals. Defining them as such is a gross inaccuracy. PEMDAS and BODMAS/BIDMAS does not explicitly state radicals but only exponents/indices. They only list five operations and group exponents and radicals under a singular title. This lacks consistency. Using the same logic they should also group multiply with divide and add with subtract but don't. PEMA does and therefore is more logical and concise and more instructive. Calling five or more different things merely “power” or “powers” is confusing and lacks specificy. You might as well just say “number” as you are not differentiating one part of an equation or another. This leads to much pointing to an object to illustrate it rather than simply referring to it by a well defined name and being completely understood. </p>


<p>Ideally all equations should have well defined labels for each part of the equation. Consider that in a binary operation there are three numbers, two numbers are combined using an operator and a third number left as the result. Even in long equations with many terms only two numbers can be operated at a time. Of the six operations the four basic operations are well understood and defined, it is only when reaching higher math such as powering and rooting there is less definition and a greater lack of clarity as to what is what. At any time up to five things can be referred to as a “power” under PEMDAS.  This is sloppy and does not provide enough clarity. Math should be well defined by clarifying terms with unique designations as to eliminate confusion when referring to a specific term. The following diagram lists the six operations with an unambiguous naming convention. </p>


<p>The picture does not completely give details how to pronounce but is drawn from that perspective, further explanation is required namely with radicals. Also a fraction is considered division here but special attention is given to renaming the dividend and divisor as numerator and denominator respectively. There may be more ways to write these operations but this is as far as I got. Not everyone is going to talk like an egghead all the time but if they do this is the proposed method to do it. Anything else is considered slang or inaccuracies for casual discussion (which is okay). </p>


<p>The number left of the operator (or top in the case of fractions) is considered the first term and is in blue.<br>
The number right of the operator (or bottom in the case of fractions) is considered the second term and is in red.<br>
The number right of the equals sign is considered the result and is in green. All math consists of a binary operation in which three numbers are involved; the first number to the left of the operator, the second number to the right of the operator, the third number right of the equals/equality sign as the answer. Most only refer to the left hand or right hand of the equation this takes things farther.
</p><p>

This is all for now. This shows how the associative property fits with Pemdas and reciprocity to form a more complete picture rather than teaching individually and leaving students to connect the dots themselves. The hope is that students connect the dots in a triangle and understand these concepts and use them together as a working unit rather than individual concepts that are scattered across math.

<section id="inverses">
<h2>Inverses, Reciprocals, Identities, and Canceling</h2>


Inverse means the opposite. In general it means to invert or flip something vertically. Inverse and invert both have 'vers' in it which means to rotate. A book has chapters that are made of verses. You turn the page, you 'vers' it. Very old latin. You will learn that verse means to rotate in trigonometry.  In math there are three types of inverses, the inverse of an operation, the inverse of a function, the inverse of a number:</p><p>


Inverse operations: These are called the reciprocal operations. They are the reverse operation that cancels another. An inverse operation works backwards from the answer to find the starting number. This can be used to check your answers. When working backwards if you arrive at the starting number then you have the right answer.</p><p>


Inverse of a function: Functions are equations with many operations. The inverse of a function cancels another function. When two functions cancel what happens is they are multiplied and the answer is 1. 1 itself cancels when it is a factor in a multiplication operation, as we will see.
</p><p>

Inverse of a number: The inverse of a number is the multiplicative reciprocal of a number. The reciprocal of a number is when you write a number as a fraction and then invert the numerator with the denominator. In multiplication when two number multiplied result to 1 as the answer they are reciprocals. A reciprocal is the number you multiply to equal one. The purpose of this is to cancel the number or term in the equation.</p><p>


When you cancel a number it is erased from the equation. There are three ways to cancel something:</p><p>


Additive inverses: Additive inverses are zero sums. If two numbers are added together and the total is 0 then the numbers used are additive inverses. Adding opposite numbers cancels them both. Although canceling is not the proper term this is the easiest way to explain it. If   8+10–8   then we can change the order to    8–8+10   =   0+10. We see that 8 and –8 are opposite of each other. These are called additive inverses. Additive inverses are used in inverse operations. Additive means adding but can also mean adding a negative number like 4 + (–1) = 4 – 1. Likewise an additive inverse we can have 4 + (–4) = 4 – 4, or simply –4+4. In either case both –4+4 and 4–4 both equal zero. This cancels them out, or more properly sums to 0.</p><p>


Reciprocals: This is the proper usage of canceling. When you multiply a number, be it an integer or a rational, and the product is 1 and the number is said to be canceled. Informally canceling is the act of reducing a fraction so that its quotient is 1.  This is better explained under the fractions section. Reciprocals deal heavily with multiplication. Under property laws there exists the law of reciprocal multiplication. </p><p>


Division: You can divide a number, term or entire equation by itself and the answer is 1. This is obvious for simple problems like 3÷3 = 1 but not more complicated problems like   √2/√2 = 1   or   (3x2+4x+7)/(3x2+4x+7) = 1.</p><p>


Identities: Identities are formulas that make canceling easier. They are used in long equations with many parts to simplify the problem before or as you work.</p></section>





<section id="operations">
<h2>Counting Basics</h2>


<p>Counting basics introduces variables using set theory. From there we move on to property laws and better examples of algebra. Math after arithmetic is called “higher math”. In higher math we categorize numbers by type into groups called sets. The study of this is called set theory. “Counting basics” uses a simple introduction to set theory.</p>


<p>Before 0 or negative numbers were recognized by western, math numbers began at 1 and counted upwards. We call this system the “natural numbers”. Natural numbers are counting numbers of the set (1,2,3...). When you see numbers in a set they are written in either set notation or as a series. A series is a pattern of numbers separated by commas inside parentheses to group them together as a set. Set notation uses brackets [] and () to show what numbers are in a set. The numbers that are in the set are called the domain. Numbers that are not in the set are not in the domain.</p>


<p>The set of counting numbers are whole positive numbers that start at 1.<br> 
Remember that 0 is neither positive nor negative so it is not included.</p>


<p>The set of whole numbers is: (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9…) The three dots are called “an ellipsis mark” or “ellipsis”. It means that the numbers go on forever. If we continue the series the numbers go forever by adding +1 to then number before the ellipsis.</p>


<p>If we start at 0 we have a different set called the “whole numbers”. Whole numbers are positive whole numbers. The set of natural numbers is: (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9…)  </p>


<p>If we start and 0 and either add 1 forever or subtract one forever we have all the positive and negative whole numbers. This set is called “integers”. Integers are whole numbers that can be positive or negative. This is the set we use most often in math. Because the numbers go in both direction forever we put ellipsis in the beginning to show that the series continues backwards forever. We are interested only in set integers and reals.
The set of integers uses two ellipsis: (…–4,–3,–2,–1,0,1,2,3,4…)  </p>


<p>The next set is fractions also called “quotients” because a fraction bar is a division bar. Fractions are made by taking a whole number and dividing it by a whole number to get a fractional number that is not whole. Fractions can be negative like –¼, mixed like 22½ or improper like 5/4. A fraction can be written like a fraction or a decimal or even a percent. The mixed fraction 22½ can be decimal like 22.5 or improper like 45/2 .</p>


<p>There are proper fractions, improper fractions, mixed fractions, and decimal fractions. 
All can be negative and all can be converted back and forth from a fraction to a decimal or percentage. </p>


<p>A proper fraction: two whole numbers divided using a “/” that is less than “±1”. <br>
An improper fraction: a mixed fraction written as a fraction instead of a decimal. <br>
A mixed fraction: an improper fraction written as a decimal.<br>
¼ and –¼ are proper fractions because they are part of a number.<br>
45/2 and 5/4 are improper because they are mixed. <br>
We could say “mixed improper fractions” but that is redundant.<br>
The set of fractions is: (all whole or negative fractions). There are fancy ways to write this that come up later.</p>


<p>The next set is “irrationals”. These are square roots and other radicals. Names like irrationals, radicals, roots, or even surds imply a rooting operation; we call these radicals for the radical symbol √. A surd can be considered an irrational square root that has been operated on by another number such as √2 – 1 = 0.414213... . This isolates the  irrational part from the integer. We call decimals either decimals or the mantissa.</p>


<p>There are the “real numbers” called the “reals” and they are all numbers except a unusual one called “complex numbers”. Finally the last set is call complex numbers which uses the letter i = √–1.   Complex numbers are not used until last part of Algebra for graphing and conics or hyperbolas. There are important ways to write the sets but that requires a study of set theory. Sets can be written dozens of way. Some more useful than others depending on what you want to convey. Instead of defining sets using formal logic I want to present a more informal definition using blackboard letters.</p>


<p>Blackboard letters are also called “double struck” letters because they have double lines. 
On blackboards they were written this way so that people did not mistake them for variables or other letters. The blackboard letters are the capital funny looking letters. Every set is a superset of the subset before it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set ℕ=  Natural numbers. Starts at 1 ends at infinity.</li>
<li>Set 𝕎 = Whole positive numbers The same set as ℤ but 0 is included. W-hole is “With hole” fills in 0 on graph.</li>
<li>Set ℤ =  Integers which called Zahlen in German. This and reals are used in Algebra.</li>
<li>Set ℚ = Quotients is another name for fractions. Fractions are p/q where both p and q are integers.</li>
<li>Set 𝕀= Irrationals: roots taken from non-index-able numbers like √2 or constants like π or e.</li>
<li>Set ℝ =  Reals are all numbers except imaginary ones like √–1 or any of the form a+bi. </li>
<li>Set ℂ =  Complex numbers are the set of imaginary ones like √–1 or any of the form a+bi.</li>
 </ul>

<p>The colored letters match the colored word in either meaning and/or show why that letter is chosen. The blackboard letters are the first letters of the word they represent. These 7 groups are basic and all the groups that exist unless somebody makes up there own group and gives it a letter. Algebra uses the integers and reals. You are not expected to know this or memorize these sets so that Is why I am telling you. Focus on the red sets.</p>


<p>Any set can be represented with a number line. Tools to find numbers, explain concepts or derive answers will use either a number line, a Cartesian graph, or a unit circle. With start with a number line to perform arithmetic functions. Then move on to graphing with uses two number lines, a horizontal number line called the x-axis, and a vertical number line called the y-axis. After Algebra concepts are mastered we introduce geometry with the use of the unit circle. The unit circle is a circle drawn on a Cartesian graph.  From geometry we introduce trigonometry and graph triangles in the unit circle. Following basic trigonometry comes advanced definitions of trig functions shown on a Cartesian graph. These definitions help lead to pre-calculus and calculus topics.  </p>



<p>The algebra concepts we want to focus on will be variables, functions and formulas.
In geometry the focus moves from to construction problems involving area and volume formulas. 
In Algebra1 we use integers, fractions, and radicals. This set of all these sets is called the reals. In Algebra2 begin to cover complex numbers, conics sections, and sequences. </p>


<p>A set is a group of elements. A set can contain other sets. A set in a set is called a subset, meaning under the set above it, meaning one level beneath it. A superset is the set above a subset. A superset contains smaller sets. A subset in inside a superset. If we want to express infinity on a number line we use the symbol ∞. It can be –∞ for negative infinity or ∞ for positive infinity. If we wanted to graph all the numbers in existence:</p>
 



<ul>
<li> ∞ = 0+1+1+1…∞ we start at 0 and add 1 forever. It does not end so it not an actual finite number. </li>
<li> –∞ = 0–1–1–1…–∞  we start at 0 and subtract 1 forever. It does not end so it not an actual finite number.    </li>
<li> Infinity is a concept not a number. We think of something being as big as possible and say “to infinity”.</li>
<li> All the negative numbers are red. Moving to the left represents subtraction. </li>
<li> All the positive numbers are blue. Moving to the right represents addition.</li>
<li> 0 is neither positive nor negative. This must be proven.</li>
<li> If a number is positive we write it as a number. The number 4 is a positive number.</li>
<li> If a number is negative we write it as a number with a negative sign. The number –4 is negative.</li>
<li> Negative numbers are called “signed” numbers because they have a minus sign in front of them. </li>
<li> All numbers have a quality value and a quantitative value.</li>
<li> The quality is whether it is positive (+) or negative (–). We use plus and minus signs to indicate quality.</li>
<li> The quantitative is how much or its “quantity”. </li>
<li> A quantity is a number value. A sign is a quality value.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we add move to the right. 2+3 =5 so we start at “2” and move three units to the right stopping at “5”. If we subtract we move to the left. 5 –3 = 2 so we start at “5” and move three units to the left stopping at “2”. People confuse the sign of the number with the sign of the operation. In both examples all numbers are positive quality so they have positive value. This places emphasis on position rather than simply figuring out the final total.</p>


<p>The are special rules for dealing with negative numbers called “value”, “absolute value”, and “sign negation”. There is a special rule for subtracting negatives called “canceling”. Canceling or cancellation or negation mean similar things and there are different situations when these words are applied. We cancel an operation or cancel a value among other things. For subtraction remember this rule: “Two negatives cancel”.</p>


<p>If 4–1 then 3, if 4 – (–1) then 5.  When we have two negative signs they cancel and turn into a single plus sign.</p>

<ul>
<li>4 – –1    we are subtracting a negative number</li>
<li>4 + 1   the signs cancel making a plus sign </li>
<li>5     the answer is 5</li>
<li>There are exactly 8 combinations for whether you move left or right. </li>
<li>The only important one is when you “subtract a negative”. Change “ ––1” to “+1”. </li>
<li>In 4 – –1 there are two signs touching with no number between them. </li>
<li>This is called “sign confliction”. Sign conflicts require rewriting both signs as one. </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>If the signs match then add:      If ++ or –– then add. </li>
<li>If the signs do not match subtract:   If +– or –+ then subtract.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sign conflicts only care about 1 thing: “Do I add or subtract?” which is “Do I move left or move right”. Whatever is before the conflict is irrelevant, only the two signs, operator sign and subtrahend sign, matter. A “minuend” is the thing to be subtracted from which the subtrahend is the thing that does the “subtracting”. They are also both called sums: sum – sum = minuend – subtrahend.</p>

<ul>
<li>Numbers are in ()'s</li>
<li>Operators are in ()'s</li>
<li>(positive)+(positive) (4)+(1)    = 5  </li>
<li>(positive)–(positive) (4)–(1)    = 3  </li>
<li>(positive)+(negative) (4)+(–1)  =3  </li>
<li>(positive)–(negative) (4)–(–1)  =5  </li>
<li>(negative)+(positive) (–4)+(1)  =–3 </li>
<li>(negative)–(positive) (–4)–(1)  =–5 </li>
<li>(negative)+(negative) (–4)+(–1) =–5</li>
<li>(negative)–(negative) (–4)–(–1) =–3</li>
<li>positive(+)positive 4(+)1 = 5</li>
<li>positive(–)positive 4(–)1    = 3 </li>
<li>positive(+)negative 4(+)–1  = 3 </li>
<li>positive(–)negative   4(–)–1  = 5 </li>
<li>negative(+)positive   –4(+)1    = –3</li>
<li>negative(–)positive   –4(–)1    = –5    </li>
<li>negative(+)negative  –4(+)–1  = –5 </li>
<li>negative(–)negative  –4(–)–1  = –3  </li>
</ul>

<p>Do not worry about the chart or attempt to memorize. The focus is the blue options where we cancel negatives. Later during polynomials all terms whether (–) or (+) are put in () and added using a + sign. Learn to understand why signs cancel, the difference between quality and quantity, and learn not to confuse “the sign of the operation” with the “sign of the number”. </p>


<p>A positive number like 1 is written without a sign and we still know it is “positive 1”. 
A negative number like –1 is written with a minus sign to tell us it is “negative 1”. This a “signed number”. You have either a positive or a negative which some people call a number or a signed number. 1+1 both numbers are positive and the operation sign is positive. 
We isolate the numbers from the operation sign like this: (1)+(1) see how the operator is excluded?</p>


<p>4 – 1   Both numbers are positive but some people and even teachers describe this as only 4 is positive. <br>
(4)–(1)   this proves both are positive because the sign is excluded.
</p>

<p>In 4 –1 people think 1 is –1 but it isn't. This confusion leads to getting a bad intuition.<br> 
There is a difference between four minus one and four minus negative one.
</p>

<p>
“four minus one” = “4 – 1”      <br>
“four minus negative one”= “4 – –1”</p>


<p>If you ever have trouble with any equation try writing it as an English sentence. This is an important life skill[1]. Part of math is getting the answer the other part is communicating it. Four parts:</p>  


<p>Learning to write the correct equation in math symbols.<br>
Learning to solve the equation.<br>
Learning to articulate the problem in English writing.<br>
Learning to articulate the answer in English writing.</p>


<p>The chart contained 8 different situations but highlighted in red was when two negatives canceled. Combinations are found using “combinatorics”. Combinatorics would know that there are 8 choices because we have two different places, two different operators, and two different qualities. This gives us 2∙2∙2 choices or 23 which is 8. It does not matter if you start with a negative or positive number and whether the final answer is negative or positive. The only consideration is if you are adding or subtracting from that number. This limits our choices:
</p>

<ul>
<li>1+1  Adding two positives we move right there is no conflict so no signs to cancel.</li>
<li>1–1  Subtracting a positive. There is no conflict so we move left.</li>
<li>1+–1 Adding a negative creates conflict. The signs differ so subtract and move left on the number line. </li>
<li>1––1 Subtracting a negative creates conflict. The signs same so move right on the number line.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The rules above do not change if the sum before is negative. A sum implies a single number or subtotal. Only negative numbers have value signs in front so that is why they are called signed. If there is doubt group numbers with () leaving only one operator between two numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li>1+1   = (1)+(1)    the last number is positive 1++1 →1+1 = 2</li>
<li>1 – 1 = (1) – (1)  the last number is positive 1–+1→ 1–1 = 0  </li>
<li>1+–1 = (1)+(–1)    the last number is negative 1+–1→ 1–1 = 0  </li>
<li>1– –1= (1)–(–1)  the last number is negative   1––1→ 1+1 = 2   </li>
</ul>

<p>These last two pages can be summed up in if signs same add and if they differ subtract but time was spent to demonstrate why and to prove whether a number is positive or negative not just what direction to move on the number line. This ends proof. ■</p>


<p>The black dot is used at the end of proofs so say “end of proof”.  You do not need to use both. This proof is important because logic and Boolean operators do weird adding of 1 and – 1.</p>


<p>We would never encounter a situation where 1 –+1 existed because we do not write positives with a plus sign. If we group (1)–(+1) the + sign cancels by itself leaving (1)–(1) which is 1–1.</p>


<p>[1] The part about writing your problem as an English sentence applies to non math as well. Before you can solve a life problem you need to define it first. Writing makes people smarter and focus more. It stimulates brain growth. Identify your problem, isolate it, then solve it. This works for all math and life problems. Write out your problems identifying what they really are, what causes them, and what steps you can do to solve them. Make a list of possible solutions then be honest and list the pros and cons for each solution. If you do not do this you will not ever change your predicament. If you are not honest it defeats the purpose. The truth does not care about your feelings and telling yourself what you want to hear is lazy and foolish. If you lie you are in denial. Feelings and emotion create bias that clouds judgment. Notice how your feelings prevent you from accepting what is right for you. Be fair and accept how you really feel but do not let that prevent you from making clear and sound decisions. Recognize bias and make sure you can function and treat people reasonably or else you are not really doing math but pseudo math. We use this in ethics and statistics to apply a fair culture of learning and working with the benefit of all members of society.</p>

<section id="operations">
<h2>Inequalities</h2>


<p>An equation is a statement that uses equals signs to compare two sums. “2+6 = 8” is an equation. Inequalities are statements that use inequality symbols instead of equation signs to compare two sums. “2<6” is an inequality.</p>


<p>There are four inequality symbols: <, >, ≤, and ≥. <br>
They are read as “less than, greater than, less than or equal, greater than or equal”.</p>

<ul>
<li>Eight is less than fifty: 8<50.</li>
<li>Fifty is more than eight: 50>8.</li>
<li>Twice a number is at least eight: 2x≥8.</li>
<li>Eight is at most twice a number: 8≤2x.</li>
<li>All positive numbers are greater than zero: x>0.</li>
<li>All negative numbers are less than zero: x<0.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use > or < to show which number has a bigger value. This is useful when using variables or stating a property law. We use ≥ or ≤ to get as close to a number without being it. This is useful in calculus limits. We use absolute value bars “| |” to indicate positive numbers. This is useful when numbers must be positive like distance. Distance is always positive. If –4 is 4 units to the left of 0 and 4 is 4 units to the right of 0 then the distance is |±4|. </p>
 

<p>When dividing or multiplying by a negative you change the sign of the number: 10÷ –2 = –5 and –10 ÷ –2 = 5<br>
When dividing an inequality flip the inequality sign if divisor is a negative number: 
</p>

<p>(–6 < 10) ÷ –2 = 3 > –5   3 is greater than –5. signs changed we have to “flip” the inequality sign.</p>



<p>(2x ≥ y)/ –2     = x ≤ ½y   Plugging in values for x and y will show that flipping the sign is required.</p>

<section id="interval notation">
<h2>Interval notation</h2>
 

<p>You can graph an inequality like you can graph an equation using a number line.3+5 > x is graphed as shown below. Solve the inequality by combining all constants placing a circle at the correct number. The correct number is 8 because 3+5 = 8. Note than is used a “more than sign” but 8>x is really x<8. It is a less than so it points to the left. We state the solution in terms of whether the variable is less or more not the sum.</p>


<p>The solution is all numbers less than “8”. We can write the answer using “interval notation”:  (a, b) = {x| a< x< b}  
3+5 > x = (–∞,8) in the form (a,b), this means The number is more than –∞ and less than  8. 
3+5 ≥ x is rewritten as x ≤ 8. It uses the inequality sign “less than or equal to”. Use a dot instead of a circle.</p>

<p>You can have two inequalities at once called compound inequalities. 
If x is less than 8 and more than 2: 2 < x < 8, or 8 > x > 2,  or (2,8). It is graphed as:</p>


<p>It uses two location marks, one at 2 and one at 8, both are circles because x can not be 2 or 8. x is any number in between 2 and 8. If x could be equal to 8 then we would use “≤”... 2 < x ≤ 8 has a dot at 8: </p> 

<p>2 < x ≤ 8 is a line segment that shows a single distance. If we have 8 < x < 2 (also 2 > x > 8) then we have a gap:</p>

<p>If x can be 2 then we need to use a compound sign “less than and equal”  ≤ or “more than or equal” ≥:</p>


<p>Now it has a dot at 2 instead of a circle. This can be written 2 ≤ x < 8 or 8 > x ≥ 2, normally signs point to the left. Signs point to the smaller number. We usually right the smaller number on the left and bigger number on the right but not always. This would be written as [2,8) because brackets include the number and parentheses exclude it. –∞ and ∞ always use parentheses. You can have [0,∞), which is all positive numbers, or (–∞,0), all negatives, but you could never write it as [–∞,0] or [0,∞] because infinity is not a number so can not be included since you can never reach it. </p>

<ul>
<li>Included values are graphed with a dot and use brackets.</li>
<li>Excluded values are graphed with a circle and use parentheses.</li>
<li>Infinities can not be included so always use parentheses.</li>
</ul>
