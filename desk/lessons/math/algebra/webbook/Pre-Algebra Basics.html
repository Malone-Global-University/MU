Pre-Algebra Basics
Arithmetic Operations

There are six main operations in arithmetic (pre-algebra + algebra):

Operation	Symbol	How to Read	Reciprocal/Inverse Operation
Addition	+	plus sign	Subtraction
Subtraction	–	minus sign	Addition
Multiplication	∙	dot	Division
Division	÷ or /	obelus or slash	Multiplication
Exponentiation	^	power	Root / Radicalization
Radicalization	√	radical sign	Exponentiation

Key idea: Every operation has an inverse (reciprocal) operation. These allow you to “work backward” and check your answers.

Number Line

Definition: A number line is a tool for counting and visualizing numbers.

Tick marks: Small lines marking numbers.

Zero: Neutral, neither positive nor negative.

Negative numbers: Use a minus sign (e.g., –2).

Positive numbers: Use a plus sign (or no sign) (e.g., +2 or 2).

Additive inverses: Numbers that cancel each other to 0 (e.g., –4 and 4).

Example of using the number line:

To calculate 2 + 3, start at 2 and move 3 units to the right → result = 5.

To calculate 4 – 2, start at 4 and move 2 units to the left → result = 2.

Addition, Multiplication, and Powers

Addition: Simply count total.

Example: 2 + 3 = 5

Multiplication: Adding groups of numbers.

Example: 2∙3 = 3 + 3 = 6

Exponentiation (powers): Adding groups of groups.

Example: 2^3 = 2∙2∙2 = 8

Properties:

Commutative: Order does not matter.

Addition: 3 + 7 = 7 + 3

Multiplication: 3∙7 = 7∙3

Division and subtraction are NOT commutative.

Fractions and Reciprocals

Fraction: A way to write division.

Example: 10 ÷ 2 = 10/2

Reciprocal: Flip the numerator and denominator. Multiplying a number by its reciprocal gives 1.

Example: 10 ÷ 2 = 10 ∙ 1/2 = 5

Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

PEMDAS: Parentheses → Exponents → Multiplication/Division → Addition/Subtraction

Perform operations inside parentheses first.

Multiplication and division are on the same level (do left to right).

Addition and subtraction are on the same level (do left to right).

Different levels must follow PEMDAS strictly.

Examples:

7 – 4 ∙ 2 = 7 – 8 = –1 ✅ (Multiplication first)

(7 – 4) ∙ 2 = 3 ∙ 2 = 6 ✅ (Parentheses first)

Multiplication with Negative Numbers

–1 ∙ 4 = –4

–(2 + 3 – 4) = –2 – 3 + 4
Rule: Multiplying by –1 gives the additive inverse.

Additive Inverse Formula:

𝑛

𝑛
n∙–1=–n
Radicals (Roots)

√ means root (inverse of exponentiation).

A number in front of a radical is multiplied.

Example: 3√4 = 3 ∙ √4 = 3 ∙ 2 = 6

Exponent rules apply after evaluating the root.

Key Principles in Pre-Algebra

Arithmetic is the foundation of all math.

All operations have inverses—used to check work.

Multiplication is repeated addition; exponentiation is repeated multiplication.

Use PEMDAS for order of operations.

Negative numbers and additive inverses follow consistent rules.

Fractions and reciprocals are tools for division and simplification.

Variables represent numbers and allow formulas.
