Last Updated : 09 Apr, 2025
Verbs are one of the most essential parts of speech in any language, as they express actions, states, or occurrences. Understanding the different forms of verbs is key to mastering grammar and effective communication. Verb forms can vary depending on tense, voice, and mood, and knowing how to use them correctly helps to build clear and accurate sentences.

In this article, we will explore the various verb forms, their uses, and how they change to convey different meanings in English.

What is a Verb Form?
Verbs are components of speech that describe an activity or a condition of someone being. Every verb has five alternative forms. A verb form is a method that means shaping or modifying a verb to match the setting that communicates about an activity that is conducted at a given moment. When to employ one of these forms is determined by the topic and content of the statement.

Root Form of the Verb
The verb root, commonly referred to as both the "base form of a verb" or the "root form of a verb", is a dictionary rendition of the word. The verb root is identical to the infinitive form, except for missing the word "to." In these other terms, this verb root seems to be the version of the verb that does not have any ends such as "es, s, ing, etc."

Examples of Root Verbs:
"I love watching movies with my friends." (Root verb – love)
"I finish my homework before 6 p.m. every day." (Root verb – finish)
"You play well." (Root verb – play)
"You are beautiful." (Root verb – be)
Characteristics:

These verbs are used in their original form.
They are known as root verbs because they serve as the base form for other verb tenses and forms.
Verb Forms V1, V2, V3, V4, V5
V1 (Base Form): This is the infinitive form without "to." It is used for the present simple tense, except in the third person singular. Examples include "go," "speak," and "write."
V2 (Past Simple Form): This form is used for expressing actions that occurred in the past and have no connection to the present. Examples are "went," "spoke," and "wrote."
V3 (Past Participle Form): Employed in perfect tenses and the passive voice, the past participle form often differs from the past simple form. Examples include "gone," "spoken," and "written."
V4 (Gerund/ Present Participle Form): This form ends in "-ing" and is used for continuous tenses and as a gerund. Examples are "going," "speaking," and "writing."
V5 (Third Person Singular Present Form): This form is used in the present simple tense for third-person singular subjects, often ending in "-s" or "-es." Examples include "goes," "speaks," and "writes."
Forms of Verbs
Below mentioned are the forms of verbs:

Simple Past Form of the Verb with Examples
The simple past form of the verb is used to denote an action that took place in the past. It is usually formed by adding an ‘ed’ or ‘d’ (for words ending in ‘e’) to the end of the root verb. However, there are irregular verbs that do not follow the general rule. Let us look at a few examples of the simple past form of the verb.

Examples of Simple Past Form
Regular verbs in the simple past form
Cheat – Cheated
Dodge – Dodged
Jump – Jumped
Skip – Skipped
Iron – Ironed
Verbs that take the same form as the root verb in the simple past form of the verb

Cut – Cut

Sit – Sat
Sing – Sang
Throw – Threw
Fly – Flew
Bring – Brought
Buy – Bought

Ring – Rang

Past Participle Form of the Verb with Examples
The perfect tense of the verb is denoted by its past participle form. Regular verbs maintain their same form in both the simple past and past participle forms, while irregular verbs change in spelling when they become past participle. To gain a better understanding, let us examine a few cases.

Present Participle Form of the Verb with Examples
The verb's base form, or root verb, is transformed into its present participle form by appending a "ing." Sometimes the final consonant of a monosyllabic word that ends in a vowel and a consonant is doubled before the word "ing" is added. In most circumstances, the "ing" is added to verbs that finish in "e," while the "e" is omitted. When a verb is changed from its base form to its present participle form, some verbs do not lose their initial "e."

The continuous/progressive tenses of this verb are used to show that the activity is still in process. Verbs can also be changed into nouns that describe actions using this technique.

Examples of Present Participle Form
Words that have double consonants
Run – Running
Swim – Swimming
Forget – Forgetting
Sit – Sitting
Cut – Cutting
Examples of regular verbs converted to the present participle form
Cry – crying
Try – Trying
Read – Reading
Write – Writing (‘e’ is removed)
Age – Ageing (‘e’ is retained)
Third Person Singular Present Form with Examples
The third person singular form of the verb is used to represent the simple present tense. As far as regular verbs are concerned, the third person singular form is indicated by the addition of an ‘s’ or ‘es’ to the end of the root verb.

Examples of Third Person Singular Present Form
Tom likes having cereal for breakfast.
Root verb – like, Third person singular form – likes

Sheela teaches English for sixth grade students.
Root verb – teach, Third person singular form – teaches

My father reads the newspaper everyday.
Root verb – read, Third person singular form – reads

The Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
Root verb – rise, set; Third person singular form – rises, sets
