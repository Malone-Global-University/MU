What is a Conjunction 
A conjunction is a word that connects clauses, sentences, or other words. The usage of conjunctions is crucial for linking clauses, phrases, and words. Understanding the proper use of conjunctions improves the clarity and effectiveness of our writing, whether we're using coordinating conjunctions to combine comparable elements, subordinating conjunctions to establish dependent clauses, or correlative conjunctions to communicate contrasting thoughts. Conjunctions can be used alone or in groups of two. For example - and, but, or are used alone but neither/nor, either/or etc are used in pairs. By interlinking different elements together, conjunctions enable us to express relationships and convey complex thoughts effectively.

Conjunction Examples
Here are some examples to understand how conjunctions are used in sentences:

Seeta and Geeta went to market.
Give me chocolate or toffee.
Ridhi and Sidhi have come
Mrs. Parul is hospitalized therefore she had not come to the office.
Types of Conjunctions

Conjunctions are mainly of four types:

 Coordinating Conjunction
 Subordinating Conjunction
 Correlative Conjunction Words
Conjunctive Adverbs
Coordinating Conjunction
And, but, or, nor, so, as well as, either _ or, neither _ nor, not only _ but also, only, then, therefore,  are called Coordinating Conjunctions. Coordinating means "equal in ranks". One can say that coordinating conjunctions are always used to add two equally ranked phrases, clauses, and sentences

Examples : 

Bheem and Chutki were playing Carrom.
You and I are students of Youtube marketing.
My family is poor but honest.
Coordinating Conjunctions are of four types:
1	Cumulative or Copulative conjunction	
as........ and, both........and, as well as, no less than, Not only ....... but also.

Ravi was both fined and imprisoned

2	Alternative or Disjunctive conjunction	
as_or, either......or, neither....nor, otherwise, else.

Either she is angry or she feigns madness

3	Adversative conjunction	
as_But, still, yet, nevertheless, whereas, while, only.

She is slow, but she is steady

4	Illative conjunction	
as_for, therefore, so, consequently.

He was found stealing, and therefore he was arrested

Subordinating Conjunction
As, because, since, if, though, although, that, before, after, till, until, as long as, when, where, why, etc are known as Subordinating Conjunctions.

Examples :

Sudheer was fined as he drink alcohol.
If she comes, I shall go.
I don't know where he lives.
Subordinating Conjunctions are of Eight types
1	Conjunction of Time	
Before, after, till/until, since, as soon as, while, as long as, when, as, whenever

8	Conjunction of Extent or Manner

Correlative Conjunction Words
A pair of correlative conjunctions are used to join similar parts of a sentence. However, correlative conjunctions don't just join nouns. We can connect verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositional phrases, and even clauses depending on which ones we use. Commas are typically not used with correlative conjunctions:

Example : 

Barsha likes both cats and dogs.
Conjunctive Adverbs
Adverbs that join one clause to another are known as conjunctive adverbs. They can also be used to demonstrate relationships such as cause and effect, contrast, and sequence. Conjunctive adverbs can be moved around in a sentence or clause just like other adverbs.

For example : 

Sudhir kept talking in class; therefore, he got in trouble.
