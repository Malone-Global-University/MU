1. Open PowerShell in your project folder

Press Win+R, type powershell, hit Enter.

Use cd to navigate to the folder containing your scripts. Example:

cd C:\mgu

2. Verify Node.js is installed

Run:

node -v


You should see a version number (e.g. v20.12.2). If not, install Node.js first.

3. Run the scripts

Both scripts are plain Node programs. Use:

node build-search-index.js
node build-index.js

4. Verify outputs

After running build-search-index.js → you should see search.json in the same folder.

After running build-index.js → you should see:

index.html in the root folder

category pages inside a categories/ subfolder

5. (Optional) Run both at once

You can chain commands in PowerShell with ;:

node build-search-index.js ; node build-index.js


Or, for automation, create a PowerShell script (e.g. build.ps1):

node build-search-index.js
node build-index.js


Then run:

.\build.ps1
