2. Workflow Flow

Artifact Creation (Internal)

All drafts, scripts, assets, screenshots, and MD files are created in MGU_DESK.

Temporary or scratch files remain untracked (no kebab-case).

Build & Automation

software/ handles:

Markdown → HTML conversion

Eleventy builds

Index generation (encyclopedia, lessons, library pages)

Build outputs are versioned in data/version via JSON and human-readable changelog.

Version Control

JSON → machine-readable versioning, timestamps, change count.

Markdown changelog → human-readable reference.

Both stored together for traceability.

Public Deployment

Finalized content is copied/published to:

community/

departments/

library/

Only these folders are tracked in Git → clean repo for Netlify deployment.

Governance & Compliance

Separate governance/ folder acts as a policy subdomain:

Accessibility, honor code, terms, legal files

Keeps compliance separate from operational workflow.

Screenshots / Documentation

Images and documentation generated during operations stored in MGU_DESK/screenshots/

Indexed and archived for dev-blog or internal audit.

3. Key Conventions
Aspect	Convention/Rule
Folders	snake_case
Files	kebab-case
Local/Scratch-only files	No kebab → not public, untracked
Internal operations	MGU_DESK
Public content	community/, departments/, library/
Shared global assets	global/
Versioning	data/version/ (JSON + changelog.md)
Governance	governance/ (subdomain-level files)

This structure enforces modularity, traceability, and clean public repos while centralizing operational workflow in MGU_DESK.
