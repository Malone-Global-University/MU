The second script is very similar to the first one, but there are some key differences in functionality, structure, and output. Here's a comparison:

1. Index Structure

First script (your original):

Groups lessons by subject using <details> and <summary> tags.

Creates a hierarchical, collapsible index.

Makes it easier to navigate many lessons, especially if you have multiple subjects.

Second script (this one):

Simply lists all lessons in one flat <ul> list, regardless of subject.

No collapsible sections or grouping.

Works fine for a small number of lessons but becomes messy for large lesson libraries.

2. Data Tracking

First script: Uses a dictionary subjects to group lessons by subject:

subjects.setdefault(subject, []).append((title, rel_path))


This allows building a subject-based hierarchy.

Second script: Just appends all links to a single list index_links:

index_links.append(f'<li><a href="{rel_path}">{title}</a></li>')


No hierarchy is stored, so the index is flat.

3. Index Styling

First script: Adds inline CSS to the index HTML to style the hierarchy and collapsible sections.

Second script: Relies solely on the external stylesheet /css/main.css, no inline CSS.

4. Output

Both scripts generate:

Individual HTML pages for each Markdown lesson using the same template.

An index.html page linking to all lessons.

Key difference in output:

First script → index.html is hierarchical and organized by subjects.

Second script → index.html is a simple flat list of lessons.

5. Features / Use Cases
Feature	Script 1	Script 2
Markdown → HTML conversion	✅	✅
Uses first line as title	✅	✅
Skeleton template for lessons	✅	✅
Hierarchical index by subject	✅	❌
Collapsible <details> sections	✅	❌
Flat index	❌	✅
Inline CSS for index styling	✅	❌
✅ Summary

Use the first script if you have multiple subjects or a lot of lessons. The hierarchical index is much more organized.

Use the second script if your lesson library is small and subjects don’t matter; it’s simpler and produces a basic flat list.
