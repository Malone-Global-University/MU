Perfect ‚Äî now I can clearly see your current workflow. Let me summarize it in terms of theme handling, component structure, and workflow practices, so you can clearly see how your system works and how it applies to all pages.

1. Theme Handling

You use CSS variables (--bg, --card, --text, --accent, --accent-hover) to control colors.

Supports:

Dark mode (default)

Light mode (system preference and manual toggle)

Light/dark overrides via .light and .dark classes on <html> (:root).

Theme toggle is implemented with JavaScript:

Saves user preference in localStorage.

Supports cycling between system ‚Üí dark ‚Üí light ‚Üí system.

Updates the toggle button icon dynamically (üíª, ‚òÄÔ∏è, üåô).

Inline style block in <head> contains all styling, no external CSS file.

2. Component Structure

Your workflow is essentially modular and semantic:

Component	Description	Notes
Navbar	<nav class="navbar"> with logo, school name, and links	Fixed at top, includes theme toggle button
Logo Container	Logo image + school name	Part of navbar
Nav Links	<ul class="nav-links">	Flexbox layout, responsive for mobile
Hamburger / Theme Button	<button id="theme-toggle" class="hamburger">	Reusable for any page with theme toggle
Hero Section	<div class="hero">	Large intro section with title and subtitle
Main Content Sections	<section>	Generic, reusable for all lesson/content pages
Footer	<footer>	Social links + copyright + last update
Theme Toggle Script	Inline <script>	Makes theme dynamic and persistent

Note: All components are inline rather than external partials or templates. This is your current ‚Äúcopy-and-paste‚Äù workflow.

3. Workflow Practices

All-in-one-page approach:

HTML, CSS, and JS are in the same file.

Allows full portability but requires edits on every page if something changes.

Semantic HTML structure:

Header / Nav ‚Üí Hero ‚Üí Main ‚Üí Section ‚Üí Footer

Clear, easy-to-read structure.

Theme-first design:

CSS variables and JS toggle allow consistent dark/light experience.

Responsive layout:

Flexbox navbar, media queries for smaller screens.

Component reusability (manual):

You can copy/paste navbar, hero, and footer to every page.

4. Observations / Suggestions

Pros:

Self-contained pages; no dependency on external CSS or JS.

Fully functional theme toggle.

Semantic, maintainable HTML.

Cons / Limits:

Updating navbar/footer requires editing every page manually.

Scaling to dozens of pages could benefit from modular components (like HTML partials or JS templates).

Inline CSS means no separation of style/content; harder for theming changes beyond colors.

If you want, I can take your current workflow and rewrite it into a modular component system that keeps everything inline but allows copy-paste-free updates for the navbar, footer, and theme. This would let you maintain many pages easily while keeping your current style.

Do you want me to do that?
