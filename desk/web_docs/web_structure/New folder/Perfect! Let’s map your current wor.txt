Perfect! Let’s map your current workflow based on what you’ve shared and the HTML structure. I’ll break it into theme handling, component structure, and workflow practices so it’s clear how your site is being built and maintained.

1. Theme

No external CSS; styling is applied inline or via default browser styles.

The “theme” is semantic and structural, not visual:

Headings (<h1>–<h3>) define hierarchy.

Sections and articles define page layout.

Inline emphasis (<strong>, <em>) highlights content.

Pros:

Quick prototyping.

Avoids dependency on external files.

Cons:

Harder to maintain consistent styling.

Visual changes require editing every page.

2. Components

Your structural components are:

Component	Description	Notes
Header	<header> with lesson title + nav links	Reusable across lessons; can be copy-pasted
Navigation	<nav> inside header	Simple links separated by `
Section	<section> container	Each major topic is a separate section
Article	<article> inside section	Subtopics or exercises; self-contained
Diagram Placeholder	<li><em>(placeholder)</em>	Will eventually hold SVG or image diagrams
Exercise Card	<article> inside
