This HTML page is a fully structured lesson page for Lesson 2: Information Architecture. Here's a breakdown of what’s going on and a few suggestions to enhance it:

1. Structure Overview

<head>

Sets charset (UTF-8) and viewport for responsiveness.

Title reflects the lesson and university.

Links to a CSS file: ../components/css/style.css.

<body>

Header & Navigation

<header> contains the main page title and nav links.

Navigation links go to Home, Lesson 1, and Lesson 2 (current).

Main Content (<main>)

Divided into sections:

Introduction: Explains what IA is.

Key Concepts: Explains mental models, browsing depth vs. breadth, search, structures, and blending structures.

Visual Diagrams: Placeholder diagrams to visually explain structures.

Exercises: Interactive tasks for students.

Summary Principles: Recap key IA principles.

Footer

Contains copyright.

2. Semantic HTML

Good use of <section> for logical grouping.

<article> is used for independent content like exercises and concepts.

Headings (<h1>–<h3>) follow proper hierarchy.

Lists (<ul>) for structures and diagrams improve readability.

3. Accessibility / Usability Notes

Consider adding aria-current="page" on the Lesson 2 nav link to indicate the current page.

Add <main> landmark (already done) for screen readers.

Could include alt text for future diagrams or images: <img src="diagram.png" alt="Tree diagram of site structure">.

4. Style / Presentation Suggestions

You’re linking to ../components/css/style.css. Make sure this path is correct relative to where lesson2.html is saved.

Consider styling exercises and diagrams with classes for visual emphasis:

<section id="exercises" class="exercise-section">


Optional: Highlight keywords like Hierarchy, Sequence, Web using <mark> for better retention.

5. Possible Enhancements

Breadcrumb Navigation

<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">
  <ol>
    <li><a href="../index.html">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="lesson1.html">Lesson 1</a></li>
    <li aria-current="page">Lesson 2</li>
  </ol>
</nav>


Internal Links for Sections

At the top, add quick links to jump to each section:

<nav class="quick-links">
  <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> |
  <a href="#key-concepts">Key Concepts</a> |
  <a href="#diagrams">Diagrams</a> |
  <a href="#exercises">Exercises</a> |
  <a href="#summary">Summary</a>
</nav>


Placeholder Diagrams

Replace <em>(placeholder for diagram)</em> with actual SVGs or images later for a better visual experience.

If you want, I can rewrite this page to include quick jump links, breadcrumb navigation, and styled placeholders for diagrams while keeping your current content intact. This would make it feel more like a polished online course page. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
I need to extract the theme and components.
ChatGPT said:

Got it! Let’s break down your theme and components from the HTML you provided. I’ll extract them clearly so you can use them for your site structure or for a component library.

1. Theme

The theme is the overall look, feel, and style of the page. From your HTML:

Theme Characteristics

Color / Style: Controlled by ../components/css/style.css. Likely includes:

Header, nav, and footer styling.

Section and article styling.

Typography (headings, paragraphs, lists).

Possibly light/dark modes if your CSS supports it.

Typography: Uses default sans-serif unless overridden in CSS.

Layout:

<header> → site title + nav

<main> → sections for content

<footer> → copyright

Structure / Mood: Academic, structured, clean, and semantic.

Accessibility-friendly: Uses semantic HTML (sections, articles, headings).

✅ Theme essence: Academic/educational, clean, structured, semantic, and easy to navigate.

2. Components

These are the reusable elements of the page:

Header Component
<header>
  <h1>Lesson 2: Information Architecture</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a> |
    <a href="lesson1.html">Lesson 1: Intro to HTML</a> |
    <a href="lesson2.html">Lesson 2</a>
  </nav>
</header>


Purpose: Shows page title and navigation.

Reusability: Can be reused on all lesson pages by dynamically changing the title and active link.

Navigation Component

Could be extracted as <nav> separately for all pages.

Optional: Add active state highlighting for current page.

Section Component

Each <section> can be treated as a reusable component:

Introduction Section

<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>...</p>
</section>


Key Concepts Section

<section id="key-concepts">
  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <article id="mental-models">...</article>
  <article id="browsing">...</article>
  <article id="search">...</article>
  <article id="structures">...</article>
  <article id="blending-structures">...</article>
</section>


Each <article> inside is also a component: concept card or lesson card.

Diagrams Section

<section id="diagrams">...</section>


Could be replaced with a Diagram Component showing different IA visualizations.

Exercises Section

<section id="exercises">
  <article id="exercise-a">...</article>
  <article id="exercise-b">...</article>
</section>


Each exercise could be a reusable exercise card component.

Summary Section

<section id="summary">...</section>


Could be a summary/recap component.

Footer Component
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2025 Malone University. All rights reserved.</p>
</footer>


Simple, reusable across all pages.

3. Extracted Component List
Component Name	Description	Notes
Header	Page title + navigation	Reusable across lessons
Navigation	Links to pages	Active link highlight optional
Section	Generic content container	Could be parameterized with id/title
Article	Sub-content (concept/exercise)	Nested inside Section
Diagram Component	Visual IA diagrams	Placeholder for now
Exercise Card	Individual exercise	Reusable for all lessons
Summary / Recap	Key takeaways	Reusable
Footer	Copyright info	Global

If you want, I can convert your HTML into a modular component-based structure where each section, article, header, and footer becomes its own reusable file in your components folder. This will make your site fully maintainable and ready for automatic page generation.

Do you want me to do that next?
