Explanation of Flow

Markdown/Data Sources – All lessons, commands, or content reside in departments/ or data/.

Build Scripts – Node.js scripts read Markdown and frontmatter, parse it with gray-matter, convert to HTML with marked.

Templates & Partials – HTML structure comes from templates; headers, footers, and navbars are included via partials.

Generated HTML – Output pages (home.html, index.html) are created in the proper folders for deployment.

Assets – CSS, JS, and images are linked in the generated HTML for styling and interactivity.

Website Output – Pages can be tested locally or deployed to Netlify/GitHub Pages.
