What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query and manipulation language for APIs. GraphQL provides a flexible and intuitive syntax to describe data requirements and interactions. It enables developers to ask for exactly what is needed and get back predictable results. It also makes it possible to access many sources in a single request, reducing the number of network calls and bandwidth requirements, therefore saving battery life and CPU cycles consumed by applications. 

Making updates to data is made simple with mutations, allowing developers to describe how the data should change. GraphQL also facilitates quick set up of real-time solutions via subscriptions. All of these features combined, coupled with powerful developer tools, make GraphQL essential to managing application data.
