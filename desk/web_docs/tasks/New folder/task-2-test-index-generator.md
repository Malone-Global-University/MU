10:46 AM 8/24/2025 Test index generator



Python 3.13 is used as a scripting language to build the program. I completed the latest version of the index generator sometime Saturday 23, 2025. I must have around 20 plus variations. Documentation of them is blotchy since early stage led to experimentation and minor changes or reverting back to previous code.





I wrote the script to walk through the community, department, and library folders. These are the only folders intended to be public. To keep Malone-Global-University/MU repo clean I added a .gitignore to disregard
