Final Repo Structure (Clean & Publish-Ready)
✅ Keep these top-level files
/index.html        ← Main entry
/home.html
/founder.html
/manifesto.html
/catalog.html
/courses.html
/directory.html    ← If it’s linked anywhere


(basically all published root-level HTML pages you want exposed — no drafts, no raw templates unless actually linked)

✅ Keep these folders
/community/        ← All published community subpages
/departments/      ← All published department/course pages
/library/          ← Dictionary, blackpapers, archives, etc.
/component/        ← Needed CSS, JS, and partial HTML
/css/              ← Global CSS (if not inside component)
/images/           ← Logos, icons, media actually used on pages
/const/            ← If site constants/config files are actually referenced

❌ Remove (or ignore) these folders
/component/registry/   ← Orphaned, not published
/component/x/          ← Orphaned, not published
/component/goal/       ← Orphaned, not published
/software/             ← Local tools
/MGU_DESK/             ← Workspace
/MGU_DOCS/             ← Docs/notes
/drafts/               ← Drafts not published
/tests/                ← Test files
/sandbox/              ← Experiments
/dist/                 ← Build output
/build/                ← Build output
/_site/                ← Build output
/public/               ← Build output
/tmp/                  ← Scratch
/.cache/               ← Scratch

✅ Keep in root (for repo health, not published directly)
.gitignore
.gitattributes
README.md   (optional, but good practice)
LICENSE     (if you want to publish terms)
netlify.toml (if you use custom Netlify config)

🔑 Bottom Line

Your published repo should only contain:

Top-level HTML files (the actual “site pages”)

community, departments, library (all published content)

component (minus registry, x, goal)

css, images, and const (if used by pages)

Minimal config files (.gitignore, .gitattributes, Netlify config)

Everything else = scratchpad → .gitignore.
