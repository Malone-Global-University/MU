Good question 👍 — versioning is about keeping clean snapshots of working scripts so you never lose your “known good state” as you experiment.

Let me break down a simple versioning system you can use for your Markdown-to-HTML converter scripts.

🔹 1. Naming Convention

Each script file gets a version number in its filename:

md_to_html_v1.0.py → your clean base (never change this).

md_to_html_v1.1.py → small improvement (e.g., add <h3> headings).

md_to_html_v2.0.py → major upgrade (e.g., add metadata, templates).

📌 Rule of thumb:

Major version bump (v1 → v2) = big changes, maybe new features or structure.

Minor version bump (v1.0 → v1.1) = small changes, bug fixes, refinements.

🔹 2. Folder Organization

Inside your C:/MGU/ project folder, create a dedicated version history area:

C:/MGU/
├── scripts/
│   ├── md_to_html_v1.0.py   ← base, never modified
│   ├── md_to_html_v1.1.py   ← slight improvement
│   ├── md_to_html_v2.0.py   ← major new features
│   └── ...


This way you can always go back to a clean working script.

🔹 3. Audit Trail (Documentation)

For each script, keep a changelog file (just a Markdown .md works fine):

C:/MGU/scripts/CHANGELOG.md


Example contents:

# Changelog for Markdown to HTML Converter

## v1.0
- Base script.
- Supports: h1, h2, bold, italic, links.
- Recursive + single-folder modes.

## v1.1
- Added support for <h3> headings.
- Improved regex for links.

## v2.0
- Added HTML template wrapper with header/footer.
- Added CSS link support.


This acts like a diary of what each version adds.

🔹 4. Feeding AI Models

When you want an AI to help design an upgrade:

Show it md_to_html_v1.0.py as the base.

Explain what new feature you want (e.g., “support for blockquotes”).

Save the AI’s output as md_to_html_v1.1.py or v2.0.py.

That way the AI never overwrites your base, and you build a family tree of scripts.

✅ With this system, you’ll always have:

A golden base script (v1.0)

Clear incremental versions you can test independently

A paper trail (CHANGELOG) to track what changed and why

Do you want me to draft you a ready-to-use CHANGELOG.md template so you can start recording updates from v1.0 onward?
