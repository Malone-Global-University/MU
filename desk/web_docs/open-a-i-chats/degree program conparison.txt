I am rebuilding my website structure...again.
I want to build comprehensive degree programs to use as a point of reference.
Then on my on personal journey build classes and tutorials based on real life projects I am working on.
I will map what I complete to the degree programs.
Students have a choice of taking classes by themselves or as part of a larger structured plan.
I am building different lessons each week, sometimes working on a different lesson a day be it math, english, or coding.
My main focus is teaching clean html, css, and javascript lessons before anything else computer related, even if hmtl comes up later in a formal degree. This means I am working in a spiral zig zagging from course to course as I nagivate my own lesson plans.



I have three different approaches to computer degrees and they overlap. I need you to examine the following structured road maos and tell me where they overlap and where they diverge.




First plan I have seems the most traditional:

What are your thoughts?


ChatGPT said:

This is a really strong foundation ‚Äî I can see how you‚Äôre spiraling between traditional academic structures, modernized CS curriculum levels, and modular ‚Äúgrab bag‚Äù ala carte topics that reflect your real-world projects. Let me break it down for you by looking at overlap vs. divergence across your three roadmaps:

üîó Where They Overlap (Common Ground)

Across all three, you are consistently covering:

Foundations of Computing

Basics of computers, history, binary, operating systems.

Digital literacy & internet fundamentals (Plan 2, Level 1; Plan 1, IT Basics; Plan 3 ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù).

Programming Fundamentals

HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics appear everywhere (Plan 1 ‚ÄúHtml5,‚Äù Plan 2 Level 1, Plan 3 ‚ÄúHtml5‚Äù).

Progression into higher-level programming (Plan 1 ‚ÄúProgramming,‚Äù Plan 2 Level 2 ‚ÄúDSA,‚Äù Plan 3 ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù).

Algorithms & Data Structures

Explicit in Plan 1 (Algorithms tree), Plan 2 Level 2, and Plan 3 ‚ÄúAlgorithms.‚Äù

Networking & Cybersecurity

Present in all three, though with slightly different emphasis.

Databases

Plan 1 (SQL & NoSQL under DS/AI), Plan 2 (Level 2 Databases), Plan 3 ‚ÄúDatabases.‚Äù

Web Development / Full-Stack

Very strong across all: HTML/CSS/JS, backend, REST APIs, core web, components, Git/dev tools.

DevOps / Tools

Git, CLI, Docker, CI/CD appear across all three.

AI & Data Science

Explicit in Plan 1 (Data Science & AI track), Plan 2 Level 4 (AI/ML specialization), Plan 3 ‚ÄúData_Science.‚Äù

Hardware / Systems

Server hardware, embedded systems, IoT are sprinkled across all three.

ü™û Where They Diverge (Differences in Framing)

Plan 1 (Traditional Academic Degree)

Structured like a university CS program.

Heavier on theory (Algorithms, CS Theory, C language, OS internals).

Splits into classic majors: CS, SE/Full-stack, Cybersecurity, IT, Data Science.

Strong ‚Äúdepartmental‚Äù divisions.

Plan 2 (Modern Pan-African CS Tree)

More streamlined, chronological progression (Level 1 ‚Üí 4).

Builds from foundations ‚Üí core ‚Üí applied ‚Üí advanced.

Easier for self-learners and beginners since it avoids overwhelming categories.

Includes ‚Äúhuman-centered‚Äù topics like HCI, ethics, accessibility.

More interdisciplinary (IoT, graphics, compiler design).

Plan 3 (A la Carte Topics)

Not hierarchical ‚Äî more like a tagging system or catalog.

Very flexible: students can pick and mix based on project needs.

Best fit for your personal ‚Äúspiral‚Äù approach (jumping between lessons).

Easier to expand ‚Äî just add a new keyword (e.g., ‚ÄúQuantum_Computing‚Äù) without reworking the hierarchy.

Includes categories like ‚ÄúSkills_Tips‚Äù and ‚ÄúWild_Series‚Äù which don‚Äôt fit academic silos but reflect real-world/project-based learning.

üß≠ How They Could Work Together

Plan 1 = ‚ÄúFormal Degree Skeleton‚Äù
Use it as your academic baseline (what a traditional university would expect).

Plan 2 = ‚ÄúCurriculum Journey‚Äù
Acts as a narrative roadmap ‚Äî great for guiding students step-by-step, especially first-time learners.

Plan 3 = ‚ÄúKnowledge Registry / Index‚Äù
Functions like a tag system or database. Each lesson you make can be mapped to one or more tags (e.g., ‚ÄúHtml5,‚Äù ‚ÄúProgramming,‚Äù ‚ÄúCore_Web‚Äù).

üëâ This way, students can choose how to navigate:

Linear ‚Üí follow Plan 2 levels.

Academic ‚Üí explore Plan 1‚Äôs structured majors.

Exploratory ‚Üí browse Plan 3 topics like a wiki.

‚ö° My Suggestion

Keep all three, but make them different ‚Äúviews‚Äù of the same knowledge base:

Student-facing: show Plan 2 (easy to follow, intuitive).

Academic-facing: keep Plan 1 (degree-level rigor).

Backend / Metadata: use Plan 3 tags to classify everything.

That way, your spiral approach of jumping between lessons will still slot nicely into both a formal program and a student-friendly progression.

Would you like me to make a comparison matrix (topics vs. plans) so you can instantly see overlaps and gaps? That way you‚Äôd know which areas are unique to each plan and which are shared.

You said:
I am working on creating an optimized workflow.
I am going to write lessons as markdown files. 
Then I will put into markdown to a html converter.
This will convert into just a main section that I will manually insert into modular templates across all subjects. 


I have a skeleton for html files.
It is modular for loading html elements using javascript.
My plan:



1. Modular template for html files. Consistent look across all pages.
2. Use javascript loaders to load html.
3. Use external stylesheet to instantly maintain all pages.
4. Write lesson in markdown and then convert to html. Insert converted html into skeleton for each new page.
5. Keep seperate files for each section of the template to be loaded: hero, header, navbar, footer, etc.
ChatGPT said:

This is an excellent workflow ‚Äî you‚Äôre basically building a lightweight static-site generator without locking yourself into a big framework. It‚Äôs flexible enough to handle your ‚Äúspiral‚Äù teaching style while keeping the site maintainable. Let me walk through what you have and suggest a few optimizations:

‚úÖ Strengths of Your Plan

Consistency (Template + Modular Sections)

Every page inherits the same header, navbar, footer, hero section ‚Üí professional, uniform look.

If you change one piece (like the navbar), it updates across the whole site automatically.

Markdown ‚Üí HTML Conversion

Separates content writing from site design.

Lets you focus on lessons without worrying about layout each time.

Centralized Styling

A single CSS file keeps design coherent across all departments/subjects.

Easy to add dark/light themes globally.

JS Loaders for Sections

Lightweight modularity, avoids duplication.

Faster workflow since you don‚Äôt manually copy headers/footers into every file.

‚ö° Suggested Optimizations
1. Automate Markdown ‚Üí Full Page

Instead of manually pasting the converted HTML into the skeleton, you could:

Write a small Python/Node script that:

Converts markdown ‚Üí HTML (just the <main> block).

Injects it automatically into your skeleton template.

Saves it as a complete .html file in the right subject folder.

That way, you stay focused on writing content, and the system builds the site for you.

2. File Organization

I‚Äôd suggest something like:

/lessons
   /computer_science
      lesson1.md
      lesson2.md
   /english
      lesson1.md
      lesson2.md
/templates
   skeleton.html
   header.html
   navbar.html
   footer.html
/css
   main.css
/js
   loader.js
/public
   /computer_science
      lesson1.html
      lesson2.html

      lesson1.html
      lesson2.html


lessons/ ‚Üí raw content (markdown)

templates/ ‚Üí your modular pieces

public/ ‚Üí generated website files (what Netlify/GitHub Pages serves)

3. Smarter JS Loader

A single loader.js could handle all your modular inserts with minimal markup:

<!-- in skeleton.html -->
<body>
  <div data-include="/templates/header.html"></div>
  <div data-include="/templates/navbar.html"></div>
  <main>
    <!-- lesson content will be injected here -->
  </main>
  <div data-include="/templates/footer.html"></div>

  <script src="/js/loader.js"></script>
</body>

// loader.js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  document.querySelectorAll("[data-include]").forEach(async el => {
    let file = el.getAttribute("data-include");
    let resp = await fetch(file);
    if (resp.ok) {
      el.innerHTML = await resp.text();
    }
  });
});


This way, you can swap out sections without touching the lesson HTML.

4. (Optional) Index/Registry Automation

You could extend your converter script to:

Auto-generate an index of lessons (by subject, tag, or date).

Update navigation or registry pages automatically.

Save you from manually maintaining ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù pages.

5. Scalability

Since you‚Äôre building a Pan-African school, this workflow can scale to thousands of lessons.

If one day you outgrow the manual process, you can slot in a static-site generator (Hugo, Eleventy) ‚Äî but your modular HTML approach will still map 1:1.

üëâ Your system is basically a hybrid between a wiki and a university LMS.
It‚Äôs simple, modular, and future-proof.

Would you like me to draft a mini end-to-end pipeline (Markdown ‚Üí injected full HTML ‚Üí auto-regenerated index page) so you don‚Äôt have to do manual pasting at all?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëå ‚Äî let‚Äôs build a minimal end-to-end pipeline for your workflow.
This will let you write in Markdown, hit a script, and get:

A finished HTML page (with your modular skeleton auto-inserted).

An updated index page (so lessons auto-list themselves).

üîß Step 1: Folder Structure

Here‚Äôs the setup:

/lessons
   /computer_science
      lesson1.md
      lesson2.md
   /english
      lesson1.md
/templates
   skeleton.html
   header.html
   navbar.html
   footer.html
/css
   main.css
/js
   loader.js
/public
   /computer_science
      lesson1.html
      lesson2.html
   /english
      lesson1.html
      lesson2.html
   index.html

üîß Step 2: Skeleton Template

skeleton.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>{{TITLE}}</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div data-include="/templates/header.html"></div>
  <div data-include="/templates/navbar.html"></div>
  <main>
    {{CONTENT}}
  </main>
  <div data-include="/templates/footer.html"></div>
  <script src="/js/loader.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


{{TITLE}} ‚Üí replaced with lesson title.

{{CONTENT}} ‚Üí replaced with converted markdown.

üîß Step 3: Loader for Modular Sections

/js/loader.js

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  document.querySelectorAll("[data-include]").forEach(async el => {
    let file = el.getAttribute("data-include");
    let resp = await fetch(file);
    if (resp.ok) {
      el.innerHTML = await resp.text();
    }
  });
});

‚úÖ Result:

üëâ Do you want the subjects sorted alphabetically (as in my example), or ordered by the way you structure them in /lessons (to preserve custom curriculum order)?

You said:
will the program parse subfolders or does it need to be set in the same folder as lesson folders?
ChatGPT said:

Great question üëç

Right now, the way I wrote the script:

for root, _, files in os.walk(LESSON_DIR):
    ...
    subject = Path(root).name


‚úÖ It will parse subfolders recursively because os.walk() goes through all nested folders.

‚ùå But the way subject is set (Path(root).name) means it only takes the immediate folder name ‚Äî so if you had deeper nesting, e.g.:

lessons/
   computer_science/
      web/
         lesson1.md


‚Ä¶it would just show the subject as web, not computer_science/web.

üîß Option 1 ‚Äî Flat Subject Names (current behavior)

Every folder (at any depth) becomes its own subject.
Example index:

Computer_Science
  lesson.md
Web
  lesson1.md

üîß Option 2 ‚Äî Preserve Folder Hierarchy (nested subjects)

If you want nested subjects (like a tree view), you‚Äôd need to keep the relative path instead of just the last folder name.

Change this line:

subject = Path(root).name


to:

subject = str(Path(root).relative_to(LESSON_DIR))


Now if your file is in lessons/computer_science/web/lesson1.md,
the subject will be computer_science/web.

You could then display that hierarchy in the index like:

Computer Science
  Web
    Lesson 1


üëâ Question for you: do you prefer your index grouped flat by immediate subject folder (e.g. Computer Science, English, Math)
or do you want it to mirror your full nested folder structure (like Computer Science ‚Üí Web ‚Üí HTML ‚Üí Lesson 1)?

You said:
flat
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî if you want the flat structure, the script I gave you already works exactly like that.

‚úî Current Behavior

It scans all subfolders under /lessons.

Each folder name (no matter how deep it is) is treated as its own ‚Äúsubject.‚Äù

Example:

/lessons
   /computer_science
      lesson1.md
      lesson2.md
   /english
      poetry.md
   /computer_science_web
      html_basics.md


Produces this index:

Computer_Science
  Intro to HTML
  Data Structures
English
  Poetry Basics
Computer_Science_Web
  HTML Basics

üö® Limitation

If you do nest folders (like computer_science/web/lesson.md), the subject would just show as web.
So for a flat system, you‚Äôll want to keep all your lesson folders at the same depth under /lessons:

lessons/
   computer_science/
   english/
   math/
   it/


That way, your index will stay clean and consistent.

üëâ Do you want me to also add a human-readable mapping (e.g., turn computer_science ‚Üí Computer Science, data_science_ai ‚Üí Data Science & AI) so the index looks polished for students?

You said:
do I need to use any special delimiters or unicode symbols like # in the markdown files?
ChatGPT said:

Not necessarily ‚Äî you only need basic Markdown syntax. The pipeline we built is very simple: it uses Python‚Äôs markdown library to convert your .md files to HTML.

Here‚Äôs what you should use:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Headers / Titles

The first line of your markdown is treated as the lesson title.

Use a single # for that first line:

# Introduction to HTML


The script strips the # and uses it for the <title> tag and the index link.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Subheadings

Optional, but nice for structuring content:

## Section 1: Basics
### Subsection: Tags


These convert to <h2> and <h3> in HTML.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Lists
- HTML elements
- Attributes
- Forms


Converts to <ul> / <li>.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Code blocks

For code snippets, use fenced code blocks (triple backticks):

```html
<p>Hello World</p>


This preserves formatting and syntax highlighting if you style it later.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tables (optional)
```markdown
| Tag      | Purpose         |
|----------|----------------|
| <p>      | Paragraph      |
| <a>      | Link           |

6Ô∏è‚É£ Links & Images
[Link Text](https://example.com)

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

No special delimiters needed beyond standard Markdown.

Don‚Äôt include <main> or <body> in your markdown ‚Äî the script injects the content into your skeleton template.

Keep one markdown file per lesson. The script assumes the first line is the title.

If you want, I can write a mini Markdown template for a lesson that‚Äôs ready to drop in and convert with your pipeline ‚Äî including headings, code blocks, and images. It would serve as a standard starter format for all lessons. Do you want me to do that?

How would I markdown this file I previously wrote: Intro to HTML tags.


Hypertext markup language (HTML) is a markup language for formatting webpages, which are called "HTML documents".
To make HTML documents you wrap your text with HTML tags.
Wrapping in tags alters the appearance visible on the screen, called how the text is "rendered".
Rendering is how different browsers display your HTML. 
Older browsers might display modern HTML incorrectly, while using obsolete html tags on newer browsers may not be supported.
Using outdated tags may produce unpredictable results on browsers that are incompatible with it.


There are two types of tags, nested and open. Nested tags come in pairs of two which include an opening tag and a closing tag. An Example of a nested tag is the header 1 tag.
To use a <h1> tag you would write <h1>...</h1> and replace the ellipsis with your chosen text. 
Notice that nested tags close by using a forward slash.
You write the tag exactly the same as the opening tag but use the </> format.


To begin let's first make an HTML template by declaring our document type using <html>...</html>. We write this:


<!DOCTYPE html>   </html>


These are the first tags written in every document. 


<!DOCTYPE html>: This is the opening tag. It is required to declare our document as a HTML file using the file extension .html or .htm.
</html>: 	 This is the closing tag. Notice it uses a forward slash to indicate it is closing the wrapped text. 


While browsers usually will render <html>...</html> it is invalid HTML and needs to be written as <!DOCTYPE html>...</html> for best practices.




If I wanted to make a heading that said "Title" I would write <h1>Title</h1>. Doing this will only show the word "Title" but not the tags as html renders them invisible.
The word title is just a place holder here, you might write something like <h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>, which of course would he followed by other chapters with the appropriate text:


<h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>


<h1>Chapter 2: Then there was the middle...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>


<h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>


The previous example used the paragraph tag to write paragraphs. Using a <p> tag makes line breaks (line spaces) to start new paragraphs. This is the same as pressing enter key on a word processor program. This is how HTML tags create returns to start new paragraphs. Html will ignore empty spaces. So if you type two or more spaces between words, or try to copy text from a document over to a HTML document, it will ignore white space and treat it as a single space.
This is why we must use tags to format our text or else it will not be formatted as typed.


Open tags are single tags that do not use a closing tag. The break space tag <br> does not use a </br> tag.
The break space tag is the same as 1. carriage return on old typewriters. 2. return keys on modern PC and smartphones (usually caller "enter" key).

If you write html it will make the text appear in a single line until you use a tag to break the space and start a new line.
For example:


1. This is a long line of text. It has multiple words and sentences. It goes on, and on and on...


2. This is a long line of text.<br>
   It has multiple words and sentences.<br><br>
   
   It goes on, and on and on...


Example 1: If we simply typed text it would be one long line.
Example 2: Using the <br> tag creates a new line. Using two <br> tags creates a empty space, similar to using the <p> tag.



Example of of all tags in a simple template:


<!DOCTYPE html> 

<h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>


<h1>Chapter 2: Then there was the middle...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>


<h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>


<p>This is a long line of text. It has multiple words and sentences. It goes on, and on and on...<//p>


<p>This is a long line of text.<br>
   It has multiple words and sentences.<br><br>
   
   It goes on, and on and on...
</p>
 </html>


Summary:

These are the most basic tags to format written text on a HTML document.
The declaration tag <!DOCTYPE html> starts a HTML webpage.
The heading 1 tag <h1> makes text bigger and in bold.
The paragraph tag <p> starts and ends new paragraphs.
The break space tag <br> makes carriage returns.
Without tags text with be single line even if we type it into editors with spaces and line breaks. 

Tips:

1. There are six different sizes of heading tags;  <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>.
2. Paragraph tags create spaces above and below the wrapped text.
3. A single break space with create 1 carriage return. Using two creates a space like a paragraph tag. Additional <br> tags create additional line spaces.

## Types of HTML Tags

There are two main types of tags: **nested** and **open**.

### Nested Tags
Nested tags come in pairs of two: an opening tag and a closing tag.  
Example: the header 1 tag (`<h1>`):

```html
<h1>Your Heading Here</h1>


Notice that nested tags close by using a forward slash (</>). You write the tag exactly the same as the opening tag but with the slash format.

Open Tags

Open tags are single tags that do not require a closing tag.
Example: the line break tag <br>:

This is a line.<br>
This starts a new line.


The <br> tag creates a single carriage return (line break).

Two <br> tags create extra space, similar to a <p> tag.

Basic HTML Template

To start an HTML document, you declare the document type and wrap your content with <html> tags:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

  <h1>Chapter 2: Then there was the middle...</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

  <h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs go here...</p>
</html>


<!DOCTYPE html> ‚Üí declares the file as an HTML document.

<html>...</html> ‚Üí wraps the entire HTML content.

Example of Paragraphs and Line Breaks

Without tags, text will appear as a single line:

This is a long line of text. It has multiple words and sentences. It goes on, and on, and on...


With <br> tags:

This is a long line of text.<br>
It has multiple words and sentences.<br><br>
It goes on, and on, and on...


Example 1: No tags ‚Üí single long line

Example 2: Using <br> ‚Üí new lines and spacing

Example 3: Using <p> ‚Üí paragraphs with space above and below

Summary

These are the most basic tags to format text in an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html> ‚Üí starts the HTML document

<h1> ‚Üí heading 1, makes text big and bold

<p> ‚Üí paragraph, creates new blocks of text

<br> ‚Üí line break for single carriage returns

Tips

There are six heading levels: <h1> ‚Ä¶ <h6>

Paragraph tags create spaces above and below wrapped text

A single <br> creates one line break; multiple <br> tags create extra spacing


---

‚úÖ **Notes on this Markdown version:**
- First line is the **lesson title**, used by your script for `<title>` and index link.  
- `##` and `###` headings organize content hierarchically.  
- Fenced code blocks (```` ```html ````) preserve HTML examples exactly as typed.  
- Lists and line breaks are properly formatted.

Absolutely! I can convert your lesson text into Markdown, keeping all the structure, headings, lists, and HTML examples. I‚Äôll also escape HTML where necessary so your pipeline renders it literally in the lesson page. Here‚Äôs the converted file:

# Intro to HTML Tags

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for formatting webpages, which are called "HTML documents".  
To make HTML documents, you wrap your text with HTML tags. Wrapping in tags alters the appearance visible on the screen, called how the text is "rendered".  
Rendering is how different browsers display your HTML. Older browsers might display modern HTML incorrectly, while using obsolete HTML tags on newer browsers may not be supported.  
Using outdated tags may produce unpredictable results on incompatible browsers.

## Types of HTML Tags

There are two main types of tags: **nested** and **open**.

### Nested Tags
Nested tags come in pairs of two: an opening tag and a closing tag.  
Example: the header 1 tag (`<h1>`):

```html
<h1>Your Heading Here</h1>


Notice that nested tags close by using a forward slash (</>). You write the tag exactly the same as the opening tag but with the slash format.

Open Tags

Open tags are single tags that do not require a closing tag.
Example: the line break tag <br>:

This is a line.<br>
This starts a new line.


The <br> tag creates a single carriage return (line break).

Two <br> tags create extra space, similar to a <p> tag.

Basic HTML Template

To start an HTML document, you declare the document type and wrap your content with <html> tags:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

  <h1>Chapter 2: Then there was the middle...</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

  <h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs go here...</p>
</html>


<!DOCTYPE html> ‚Üí declares the file as an HTML document

<html>...</html> ‚Üí wraps the entire HTML content

Example of Paragraphs and Line Breaks

Without tags, text will appear as a single line:

This is a long line of text. It has multiple words and sentences. It goes on, and on, and on...


With <br> tags:

This is a long line of text.<br>
It has multiple words and sentences.<br><br>
It goes on, and on, and on...


Example 1: No tags ‚Üí single long line

Example 2: Using <br> ‚Üí new lines and spacing

Example 3: Using <p> ‚Üí paragraphs with space above and below

Summary

These are the most basic tags to format text in an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html> ‚Üí starts the HTML document

<h1> ‚Üí heading 1, makes text big and bold

<p> ‚Üí paragraph, creates new blocks of text

<br> ‚Üí line break for single carriage returns

Tips

There are six heading levels: <h1> ‚Ä¶ <h6>

Paragraph tags create spaces above and below wrapped text

A single <br> creates one line break; multiple <br> tags create extra spacing

‚úÖ **Key Changes for Markdown Pipeline**:

1. Escaped HTML examples are inside **fenced code blocks** so they display literally.  
2. Organized your content with **`##` and `###` headings**.  
3. Lists and tips are properly formatted with `-` and numbered lists.  
4. First line is a **title** (used by your script for index and `<title>`).

  <p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

  <h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs go here...</p>
</html>


<!DOCTYPE html> ‚Üí declares the file as an HTML document

<html>...</html> ‚Üí wraps the entire HTML content

While browsers may render <html>...</html> alone, it is best practice to include <!DOCTYPE html> at the top.

Headings and Paragraphs

If you want to make a heading that says "Title", you would write:

<h1>Title</h1>


This will only show the text ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù ‚Äî the tags themselves are invisible in the browser.
You can use headings for multiple chapters:

<h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: Then there was the middle...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>


The <p> tag is used for paragraphs, creating line breaks between blocks of text.

HTML ignores extra spaces typed in the document; always use tags for formatting.

Line Breaks with <br>

Without tags, text appears as a single line:

This is a long line of text. It has multiple words and sentences. It goes on, and on and on...


Using <br> for line breaks:

This is a long line of text.<br>
It has multiple words and sentences.<br><br>
It goes on, and on and on...


One <br> ‚Üí single line break

Two <br> ‚Üí empty space similar to <p>

Full Example Template
<!DOCTYPE html> 

<h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: Then there was the middle...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<p>This is a long line of text. It has multiple words and sentences. It goes on, and on and on...</p>

<p>This is a long line of text.<br>
   It has multiple words and sentences.<br><br>
   It goes on, and on and on...
</p>

Summary

These are the most basic tags to format text on an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html> ‚Üí starts the HTML webpage

<h1> ‚Üí heading 1, makes text larger and bold

<p> ‚Üí paragraph, creates spaces between blocks of text

<br> ‚Üí line break for single carriage returns

Tips

There are six heading levels: <h1> ‚Ä¶ <h6>

Paragraph tags create spacing above and below wrapped text

A single <br> creates one line break; multiple <br> tags create extra spacing

Always use tags to format your text ‚Äî HTML ignores extra spaces typed directly

# Intro to HTML Tags

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for formatting webpages, which are called "HTML documents".  
To make HTML documents, you wrap your text with HTML tags. Wrapping in tags alters the appearance visible on the screen, called how the text is "rendered".  
Rendering is how different browsers display your HTML. Older browsers might display modern HTML incorrectly, while using obsolete HTML tags on newer browsers may not be supported.  
Using outdated tags may produce unpredictable results on incompatible browsers.

There are two types of tags: **nested** and **open**.  
Nested tags come in pairs of two which include an opening tag and a closing tag. An example of a nested tag is the header 1 tag.  
To use a `<h1>` tag you would write:

```html
<h1>Your Heading Here</h1>


Notice that nested tags close by using a forward slash. You write the tag exactly the same as the opening tag but use the </> format.

To begin, let's first make an HTML template by declaring our document type using <html>...</html>. We write this:

<!DOCTYPE html>   
</html>


These are the first tags written in every document.

<!DOCTYPE html> ‚Üí opening tag; required to declare our document as an HTML file using .html or .htm extension

</html> ‚Üí closing tag; notice the forward slash indicates it is closing the wrapped text

While browsers usually will render <html>...</html>, it is invalid HTML and needs to be written as:

<!DOCTYPE html>...</html>


for best practices.

If I wanted to make a heading that said "Title" I would write:

<h1>Title</h1>


Doing this will only show the word "Title" but not the tags, as HTML renders them invisible.
You might write something like:

<h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: Then there was the middle...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>


The previous example used the <p> tag to write paragraphs. Using a <p> tag makes line breaks (line spaces) to start new paragraphs.
This is the same as pressing the enter key on a word processor.
HTML ignores extra spaces, so you must use tags to format text, or it will not appear as intended.

Open tags are single tags that do not use a closing tag.
The break space tag <br> does not use a </br> tag.
The <br> tag is the same as:

Carriage return on old typewriters

Return key on modern PCs and smartphones (usually called the "enter" key)

If you write HTML text without tags, it will appear in a single line until you use a tag to break the space and start a new line.

Example:

1. This is a long line of text. It has multiple words and sentences. It goes on, and on and on...

2. This is a long line of text.<br>
   It has multiple words and sentences.<br><br>
   It goes on, and on and on...


Example 1: Simply typing text ‚Üí one long line

Example 2: Using <br> ‚Üí creates new lines

Using two <br> tags ‚Üí creates empty space similar to using <p>

Example of all tags in a simple template:
<!DOCTYPE html> 

<h1>Chapter 1: In the Beginning...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: Then there was the middle...</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<h1>Chapter 3: Now our story comes to an end.</h1>
<p>Paragraphs go here...</p>

<p>This is a long line of text. It has multiple words and sentences. It goes on, and on and on...</p>

<p>This is a long line of text.<br>
   It has multiple words and sentences.<br><br>
   It goes on, and on and on...
</p>

Summary

<!DOCTYPE html> ‚Üí starts an HTML webpage

<h1> ‚Üí heading 1, makes text bigger and bold

<p> ‚Üí starts and ends new paragraphs

<br> ‚Üí line break / carriage return

Without tags, text will appear as a single line even if typed with spaces or line breaks in the editor.

Tips

Six heading sizes: <h1> ‚Ä¶ <h6>

Paragraph tags create spaces above and below text

A single <br> ‚Üí one line break; two <br> ‚Üí space like a paragraph tag; multiple <br> ‚Üí more spacing

Always use tags for formatting; HTML ignores extra whitespace
