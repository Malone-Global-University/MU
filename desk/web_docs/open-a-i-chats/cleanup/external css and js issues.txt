I can see why your external theme CSS and JS might not be loading correctly. Let‚Äôs go step by step and troubleshoot this.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check your folder structure
From your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="components/THEME/WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME.css">
<script src="components/WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME/WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME.js" defer></script>
Your folder structure must exactly match:

home.html
components/
 ‚îî‚îÄ THEME/
     ‚îú‚îÄ WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME.css
     ‚îî‚îÄ WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME.js
Common mistakes:

Capitalization mismatch (THEME vs theme)

Extra slashes or missing folders

JS and CSS files in a different folder than you think

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check relative vs absolute paths
Your <link> and <script> are relative paths from home.html.

If home.html is in the root, then components/THEME/... is correct.

If home.html is actually inside another folder (e.g., pages/home.html), your paths need to be adjusted:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../components/THEME/WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME.css">
<script src="../components/WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME/WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME.js" defer></script>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure your server allows loading from that folder
If you‚Äôre testing locally without a server (file://home.html), some browsers block certain JS/CSS loads due to CORS/security.

Running a local server fixes this:

# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
Then go to: http://localhost:8000/home.html

4Ô∏è‚É£ Check browser dev tools
Open Chrome/Firefox dev tools ‚Üí Console and Network tab:

Are there 404 errors for your CSS or JS?

If yes, the path is wrong.

If the file loads but the theme doesn‚Äôt work, there might be an issue inside the JS/CSS code itself.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm WORKING-TOGGLE-THEME.js uses defer
You already added defer, which is good. Make sure your JS references the right button ID:

const toggle = document.getElementById('theme-toggle'); // must match the button in HTML
‚úÖ Quick checklist:
Folder names match exactly (case-sensitive).

Paths are relative to home.html.

Test via http://localhost:8000 (local server).

Check dev tools for 404s or JS errors.

Confirm JS code references correct DOM elements.

If you want, I can rewrite your HTML with correct external file references and a bulletproof folder structure for Netlify deployment so your toggle theme works immediately.

Do you want me to do that?
