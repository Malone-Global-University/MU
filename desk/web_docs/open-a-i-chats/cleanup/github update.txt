You said:
my github is being updated but live site is not.
ChatGPT said:
If your GitHub repo is updating but your live site isn’t, it’s almost always because your deployment step isn’t running or it’s pointed at the wrong source.
Since you’re using Cloudflare Pages for Malone University, here are the most common things to check:

1. Check Cloudflare Pages project settings
Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Your Project → Settings → Build & Deploy.

Verify:

Production branch matches the branch you’re pushing to (probably main).

Build command and Output directory are still correct.

Automatic deployments are enabled.

2. Check recent build logs
Go to Cloudflare Pages → Deployments.

See if there’s a failed build or no build triggered after your last push.

If there’s no build, Cloudflare might not be connected to your current GitHub repo (especially if you changed repos/accounts recently).

If there’s a failure, the logs will show exactly what broke.

3. If you switched GitHub accounts/repos
Cloudflare doesn’t auto-detect a new repo — you must disconnect and reconnect it under “Source Settings”.

Make sure Cloudflare has OAuth access to the repo in your new GitHub account.

4. Manually trigger a deploy
In the Deployments tab, click "Trigger new deploy → Deploy from branch".

If it builds successfully, the connection works — the problem is probably with auto-deploy triggers.

5. Check caching
Even if Cloudflare deploys, your browser or Cloudflare edge cache might be serving an old version.

Try Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh).

In Cloudflare → Caching, purge cache for the whole site.

Given your earlier repo changes, my first guess is that your Pages project is still linked to the old GitHub repo.
That would mean your pushes to the new repo are doing nothing for the live site.

Do you want me to walk you through relinking your new repo to Cloudflare Pages without losing your current site settings? That’s the fastest fix if this is the problem.

You said:
deployment was successful, how long till site is updated i.e. changes are live?
ChatGPT said:
On Cloudflare Pages, once a deployment is marked as “successful” in the dashboard, the changes are usually live within seconds to a minute.

If you’re not seeing the update instantly, the delay is almost always because of caching:

Cloudflare CDN cache — may still serve the old HTML/CSS/JS until you purge it.

Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Caching → Purge Everything (or purge just the changed files).

Browser cache — may be holding on to the old version.

Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) / Cmd + Shift + R (Mac).

If you purge and hard refresh and still don’t see changes, that means the deployment was successful but for a different branch or repo than your live site.

If you want, I can give you a quick way to confirm exactly which version is live by embedding a version stamp in your HTML so you can check instantly after deploy. That way you know if it’s just caching or an actual deployment mismatch.

You said:
okay
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a quick way to check if your live site is actually showing the newest build:

1. Add a version stamp to your HTML
At the bottom of your main HTML file (right before </body>), add something like:

<!-- Version: 2025-08-10 11:45 -->
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:0.8rem;color:gray;">
  Build: 2025-08-10 11:45
</p>
Use the current date & time so it’s unique every time you deploy.

2. Commit & push
git add .
git commit -m "Add build timestamp"
git push
3. Wait for Cloudflare build success
Once it says "Deployment successful", visit your site.

4. Hard refresh & check
Press Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) / Cmd + Shift + R (Mac).

If you still see the old timestamp, it’s either:

Cloudflare serving from cache → Purge cache in Cloudflare → Caching → Purge Everything.

Wrong repo/branch linked in Pages → It’s deploying, but not the site you’re visiting.

If you want, I can give you a 1-line JavaScript snippet that automatically prints the deployment date in the footer so you never have to update it manually again. That way you’ll always know instantly whether you’re seeing the new build.

You said:
I have cloudflare+github+netlify. What does each one do and how does deployment work in my setup to make a site live? I am using pages and no cloudflare workers.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’ve basically got three moving parts in your setup:

You’re hosting on Cloudflare Pages, but you also have GitHub (source control) and Netlify (which can also do builds/deploys).
Since you’re not using Cloudflare Workers, it’s a pretty standard static site pipeline.

Let’s break it down in plain terms:

1. GitHub – Your Code Storage & Trigger
Your GitHub repo is the single source of truth for your site’s files.

Whenever you push changes to a branch (usually main), that push sends a webhook event to connected services (Cloudflare Pages or Netlify).

Think of it as your code warehouse.

2. Cloudflare Pages – Your Actual Hosting
Cloudflare Pages is where your site actually lives online.

When GitHub tells Cloudflare “Hey, new code was pushed!”, Cloudflare:

Pulls the latest code from the linked repo/branch.

Runs your build command (if you have one — for plain HTML/CSS/JS, there’s often no build step).

Outputs the files to its global CDN.

The CDN instantly makes those files available on all edge servers worldwide, so your site loads fast everywhere.

3. Netlify – Optional Host/Build Service
Netlify can do exactly the same job as Cloudflare Pages:

Connect to GitHub

Pull code on push

Build & deploy to their CDN

If you have both Netlify and Cloudflare Pages connected to the same GitHub repo, both will try to build when you push.

But only the one whose URL you visit is what you’ll actually see live.

Example:

Cloudflare URL → maloneuniversity.org

Netlify URL → your-site.netlify.app

If your domain’s DNS in Cloudflare points to Cloudflare Pages, Netlify’s deploys won’t affect the live site.

How Deployment Works in Your Setup
Since you said:

Cloudflare Pages is the live host.

Netlify might still be connected but isn’t serving your domain.

Flow looks like this:

You edit files locally →
Commit & push to GitHub →
GitHub triggers Cloudflare Pages build →
Cloudflare builds site and deploys to CDN →
Your domain (via Cloudflare DNS) points to Pages →
Visitors see updated site (after cache clears)
If Netlify is still connected, it’s just silently building the site in parallel, but you won’t see that version unless you visit your Netlify subdomain.

If you want, I can diagram your exact deployment pipeline so you can see exactly where each service fits and whether Netlify is even doing anything for your live site.
That would also make it easier to debug why updates aren’t showing instantly.

You said:
I have github to manage changes, cloudlfare for dns with cname pointed at netlify, netlify to service the site (host). If a page is broke is says contact netlify not cloudflare.
ChatGPT said:
Ah, okay — that changes things.
In your setup, Netlify is the actual web host, and Cloudflare is just the “traffic director” (DNS + CDN layer).

Here’s your real pipeline based on what you just described:

How Your Current Setup Works
GitHub – You store your site’s code here.

Every time you git push to your repo, Netlify gets a webhook from GitHub.

Netlify – Your actual hosting service.

Pulls the latest code from GitHub.

Runs your build step (or just serves static files if no build).

Deploys the site to their CDN and serves it from a yoursite.netlify.app backend.

If something breaks, the error page is generated by Netlify (hence “Contact Netlify” messages).

Cloudflare DNS – Your domain name manager.

When someone visits maloneuniversity.org, Cloudflare’s DNS points them to your Netlify site using a CNAME record (often to yoursite.netlify.app).

If proxying is enabled (orange cloud in Cloudflare), it can also provide caching, SSL, and firewall filtering, but it’s still Netlify that actually serves the files.

What This Means for Deployments
When you push to GitHub:

GitHub → triggers Netlify build → Netlify deploys to CDN → Cloudflare DNS sends visitors to Netlify
Cloudflare itself is not building or hosting your site in this setup.

A deployment is live as soon as Netlify finishes its build and their CDN updates (usually within seconds to 1–2 minutes).

If you still see the old site after a “successful deploy,” it’s usually:

Cloudflare cache (purge in Cloudflare dashboard)

Browser cache (hard refresh)

Wrong branch or repo linked in Netlify settings

If You Want Cloudflare to Host Instead
You’d have to:

Move your hosting from Netlify to Cloudflare Pages

Update your Cloudflare DNS CNAME to point to the Cloudflare Pages endpoint instead of netlify.app

Then Cloudflare would be the one showing “contact Cloudflare” style error messages instead of Netlify.

If you want, I can give you a side-by-side comparison of keeping Netlify vs switching to Cloudflare Pages so you can decide which one makes more sense for your online school.
That’ll also show which is faster and cheaper for your exact use case.

You said:
My wiring was bad. I fixed it. I have to wait for dns propagation. A records stay resolved (cloudflare), I had to do to cloudflare and update cname pointing at netlify from maloneuniversity.org.netlify.app to malone-global-university.org.netlify.app (I moved repo to new github account and cloudflare was pointing at old .netlify.app which was pointing at old github repo).
ChatGPT said:
Ah — got it.
So the DNS side was sending traffic to the old Netlify project, which was still tied to the old GitHub repo, so your pushes weren’t affecting the live site at all.

Now that you’ve updated the CNAME in Cloudflare to point to the new Netlify subdomain (malone-global-university.org.netlify.app), the pipeline is:

New GitHub Repo → New Netlify Site → Cloudflare CNAME → maloneuniversity.org
What happens next
DNS propagation:

Cloudflare usually updates instantly inside its network, but ISP caches worldwide can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours to refresh.

In reality, most people will see the update in 5–30 minutes, but some visitors may see the old site until their local DNS cache expires.

CDN caching:

If Cloudflare proxy is on (orange cloud), you might still need to Purge Cache in the dashboard to ensure old HTML/CSS/JS isn’t being served.

If you want to verify right now whether the DNS change is live in your area, you can run:

nslookup maloneuniversity.org
or

dig maloneuniversity.org
and check if it returns:

malone-global-university.org.netlify.app
If you’d like, I can give you a one-line DNS check you can run every few minutes to know exactly when your CNAME is fully propagated. That way you don’t have to just keep refreshing the site blindly.

          104.21.112.1
ChatGPT said:
Yep — that nslookup output shows Cloudflare’s Anycast IPs (104.21.x.x and 2606:4700:3030::...), which means your browser is still talking to Cloudflare’s edge network, but we’re not yet seeing the underlying Netlify CNAME in that lookup.

That’s because when Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud) is on, DNS lookups return Cloudflare’s IPs instead of the origin (Netlify).
The actual CNAME target (malone-global-university.org.netlify.app) is hidden unless you pause Cloudflare proxy or use a tool that queries DNS without proxy resolution.

To confirm that the new CNAME is live
You can run:

nslookup -type=cname maloneuniversity.org
or

dig CNAME maloneuniversity.org
If it shows:

maloneuniversity.org canonical name = malone-global-university.org.netlify.app
✅ then your update has propagated.

If that check still shows the old .netlify.app target, it means the change is still propagating through DNS (or you’re hitting a cached record at your ISP).
Usually Cloudflare’s internal DNS updates are instant, but the CNAME change can take a few minutes to show globally.

Do you want me to give you a public DNS checker link that’ll show you which countries are already seeing your new Netlify CNAME?
That way you’ll know exactly when it’s fully live.

You said:
https://www.whatsmydns.net/#CNAME/maloneuniversity.org confirms a records but not cname. This might take an hour.
ChatGPT said:
Right — that makes sense.

Because you have Cloudflare proxy enabled (orange cloud), public DNS checkers like whatsmydns.net won’t show the underlying CNAME to Netlify — they’ll only see Cloudflare’s A/AAAA records.

So even if your CNAME change is already live inside Cloudflare’s system, external tools will just keep reporting Cloudflare’s IPs. That’s expected behavior — it’s part of Cloudflare’s origin hiding feature.

What this means for you:

If you want to truly confirm whether the change to malone-global-university.org.netlify.app is active, you’d have to temporarily turn off the proxy (gray cloud in DNS settings), check propagation, then re-enable it.

Otherwise, the best real-world test is just to visit your site after clearing Cloudflare cache + browser cache and see if it’s pulling from the new repo.

If the site starts showing your latest GitHub changes after you purge cache, you can consider DNS propagation done — even if tools like whatsmydns still show the A records.

Do you want me to walk you through how to purge Cloudflare cache and browser cache in the right order so you can confirm the new site is live without disabling proxy?

You said:
I think I should just not touch anything and let propagation finish. I deleted old repo in netlify what was owned by github user alpha group, then connected cloned repo that was owned by github user epsilon group. github user had 5 websites in a monorepo, I deleted malonuniversity.org from alphas and cloned it to epsilon so that it had its own repo at github. I went to netlify and associated the domain maloneuniversity.org to the new github user/repo "epsilon/malone-global-university". This created a new netlify.app which is live. I went to cloudflare and pointed cname at this new netlify app. DNS cname changes are slow so I will be patient. I am confident everything is wired correctly (fingers crossed).   
ChatGPT said:
Yeah — given what you just described, you’ve done the hard part already.
At this point, the safest and smartest move is exactly what you said: hands off, let DNS do its thing.

Here’s what will happen next:

Cloudflare DNS update is already instant inside their network.

External resolvers (ISPs, corporate networks, mobile carriers) may still serve cached DNS for up to the old record’s TTL — usually a few minutes to a couple hours.

Once those caches expire, everyone will start hitting the new Netlify project (malone-global-university.org.netlify.app), which is tied to your new GitHub repo under epsilon.

Signs you’re fully live:

Visiting maloneuniversity.org shows your latest GitHub changes without a cache purge.

Netlify’s deploy logs line up exactly with what you see on the site.

The “contact Netlify” page, if triggered, shows the new Netlify project name in the URL.

Since you deleted the old Netlify project and repo, there’s zero risk of visitors hitting outdated files once DNS propagation completes — they’ll either see the new site or a temporary failure until the lookup refreshes (very rare with Cloudflare in front).

If you want, I can give you a quick test page to drop in the new repo so you’ll know the exact moment the new DNS takes over everywhere. That way you don’t have to keep guessing.

You said:
check to see if https://malone-global-university.netlify.app/ is live
ChatGPT said:
I can’t open that link directly from here right now, but you can check it yourself quickly:

Open https://malone-global-university.netlify.app/ in your browser.

If it loads your latest site content, it’s live and wired to your new GitHub repo.

If it shows an error or placeholder page, then the Netlify project may not have deployed yet.

If you want, I can give you a short Netlify CLI command that will confirm deployment status without even opening the browser. That way you can see instantly if it’s live and which commit it’s serving.

You said:
then it is live.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — if https://malone-global-university.netlify.app/ is live, then your hosting side is 100% good.

Now it’s just a matter of waiting for the Cloudflare DNS change to finish propagating so maloneuniversity.org points to that new Netlify project everywhere.

Once that’s done, your full chain will be:

GitHub (epsilon/malone-global-university)
   ↓
Netlify (malone-global-university.netlify.app)
   ↓
Cloudflare DNS (CNAME → Netlify)
   ↓
maloneuniversity.org (live site)
If you want, I can give you a couple of low-TTL DNS settings for next time so propagation happens in minutes instead of hours when you make a change like this again.

You said:
Github manages my updates to site. Netlify hosts the site and broadcasts it live. Cloudflare manages DNS traffic. I think this is a good setup. 
ChatGPT said:
Yep — that’s a solid, clean setup, and it matches exactly how a lot of professional static site deployments are done.

Here’s the short version of your stack:

GitHub → 📂 Code storage + version control

Netlify → 🚀 Build + hosting + CDN

Cloudflare → 🌍 DNS + optional caching, SSL, firewall

Advantages of this setup:

Separation of concerns — each service does what it’s best at.

Fast global delivery — Netlify’s CDN + Cloudflare’s edge caching = very quick site loads.

Simple updates — push to GitHub → auto-build on Netlify → live site in minutes.

Extra security — Cloudflare protects against DDoS, bad bots, and can hide your Netlify origin.

Flexibility — If you ever change hosts, you only update the CNAME in Cloudflare; your GitHub + domain stay the same.

The only “gotcha” is that Cloudflare’s proxy hides your CNAME from DNS checkers, so when you make changes like you did today, you have to either trust the wiring or briefly disable proxy to verify.

Once DNS finishes propagating for maloneuniversity.org, you’ll be fully set.

I can draw you a one-page visual map of your deployment pipeline so you always have a quick reference when troubleshooting — would that help?

No — that diagram only shows a generic deployment workflow (GitHub → Netlify → Cloudflare → your domain).
It doesn’t include API keys, passwords, server IPs, or any private repository content.

The only identifiable detail is your public domain name (maloneuniversity.org), which is already visible to anyone on the internet.
