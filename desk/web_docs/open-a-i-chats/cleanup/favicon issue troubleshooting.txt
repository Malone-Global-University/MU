The issue isn’t with your <nav> at all — your favicon visibility depends on how it’s declared in each page’s <head> section.

Right now, it sounds like:

index.html has the <link rel="icon" ...> tag

The other HTML pages probably don’t have it, so the browser only shows it on the home page.

To fix it, you need to make sure every HTML file has this in the <head> section:

<link rel="icon" href="/images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/images/apple-touch-icon.png" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/images/favicon-32x32.png" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/images/favicon-16x16.png" />
Key points:

Use absolute paths (/images/...) so it works no matter which subfolder the page is in.

Every HTML page needs the same <head> icon code.

If you have many pages, consider putting the <head> content in a reusable HTML include or template so you don’t manually copy it everywhere.

If you want, I can rewrite your site so the favicon shows up on all pages automatically without pasting the same code into each one. That would prevent this from happening again.

Do you want me to make that reusable version?

Got it — GitHub confirms you committed the favicon changes, but that doesn’t necessarily mean every page is pulling it in.

Here’s what’s likely happening:

Your index.html is at / so /images/favicon.ico resolves fine.

Your other pages (like /static/jm) are actual .html files in a subfolder — and if their <head> is using a relative path like images/favicon.ico instead of /images/favicon.ico, the browser looks for it in /static/images/favicon.ico (which doesn’t exist).

That’s why it’s only showing on the homepage.

Quick fix:

In every page’s <head>, make sure it’s:

<link rel="icon" href="/images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
(not images/favicon.ico without the leading /)

Deploy again so Cloudflare serves the updated HTML.

Hard-refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) or clear the favicon cache — browsers can be very stubborn about old favicons.

If you want, I can scan your repo file tree and rewrite your <head> blocks so the favicon loads globally without manually editing each HTML page. That would make it future-proof.

Do you want me to go ahead and do that?

Alright — here’s the fix that will make your favicon show on every page, even ones in subfolders.

1. Add correct favicon code to every page’s <head>
Use absolute paths so no matter where the HTML file lives, the favicon will load from /images/.

<link rel="icon" href="/images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/images/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/images/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/images/favicon-16x16.png">
2. Make it reusable
Since you have multiple .html files, we don’t want to paste this over and over.
We can use a single head.html include and pull it into each page.

Example structure:

maloneuniversity.org/
│
├── includes/
│   └── head.html
├── index.html
├── static/
│   ├── jm.html
│   ├── mission.html
│   └── ...
└── images/
includes/head.html

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<title>Malone University</title>

<!-- Favicon -->
<link rel="icon" href="/images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/images/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/images/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/images/favicon-16x16.png">

<!-- Styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css">
Then in each HTML page:

<head>
  <!--#include virtual="/includes/head.html" -->
</head>
⚠ This uses Server Side Includes (SSI) — Cloudflare Pages supports it if you enable the right build process (or we can precompile with a GitHub Action before deploy).

3. Browser cache note
Even after fixing, Chrome may still show the old icon because favicons are heavily cached.
Do a hard refresh:

Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R

Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
Or open the page in a private/incognito tab to see the update.

If you want, I can modify your repo right now so:

head.html is created with the favicon code

All pages automatically pull it in before deploy

No more duplicate <head> maintenance

Do you want me to make that repo-ready version? That would make this a one-time fix forever.
