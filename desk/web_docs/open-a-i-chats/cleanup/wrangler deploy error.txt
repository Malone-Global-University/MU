X [ERROR] Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets directory


  If there is code to deploy, you can either:
  - Specify an entry-point to your Worker script via the command line (ex: npx wrangler deploy
  src/index.ts)
  - Or create a "wrangler.jsonc" file containing:

  
{
    "name": "worker-name",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-08-09",
    "main": "src/index.ts"
  }



  If are uploading a directory of assets, you can either:
  - Specify the path to the directory of assets via the command line: (ex: npx wrangler deploy
  --assets=./dist)
  - Or create a "wrangler.jsonc" file containing:

  
{
    "name": "worker-name",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-08-09",
    "assets": {
      "directory": "./dist"
    }
  }

Wrangler is complaining because you ran wrangler deploy without telling it what to deploy — it needs either:

A Worker script entry point (main) — for server-side Workers code (JavaScript/TypeScript).

An assets directory (assets.directory) — for static site hosting.

Since your maloneuniversity.org is a static website (HTML, CSS, JS), you should point Wrangler to your site’s build/output folder.
If you’re not running a build step, this is probably your project’s root or a /public folder.

Fix for static site
If your site files are in the root directory:

wrangler deploy --assets=.
If they’re in a folder like dist or public:

wrangler deploy --assets=public
Permanent config in wrangler.json
Instead of typing that every time, create a wrangler.json (or wrangler.jsonc) in your project root:

{
  "name": "maloneuniversity",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-08-09",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "."
  }
}
(Replace . with public or dist if your files are in a subfolder.)

Then you can just run:

wrangler deploy
Do you want me to set this up so maloneuniversity.org deploys straight from your GitHub repo with Wrangler each time you push? That would make it one-click (or no-click) publishing.

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Alright — we can set up automatic Wrangler deployments from GitHub so your maloneuniversity.org site updates every time you push to the repo.

Here’s the step-by-step plan for Cloudflare Pages + Wrangler GitHub Actions:

1. Create wrangler.json
In your project root (maloneuniversity.org folder), create a file called wrangler.json:

{
  "name": "maloneuniversity",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-08-09",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "."
  }
}
If your static site is in a subfolder (like public or dist), change "." to that folder name.

2. Get a Cloudflare API Token
We’ll need this for GitHub Actions to deploy automatically.

Log into Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens.

Click Create Token → Use "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template.

Name it something like GitHub Wrangler Deploy.

In the "Account Resources" section, select your account.

Save and copy the token — we’ll add it to GitHub in the next step.

3. Add Secret to GitHub
In your mgu repo:

Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.

Name: CF_API_TOKEN

Value: paste the API token from step 2.

4. Create GitHub Actions Workflow
In your repo, create the folder .github/workflows/ and add a file named deploy.yml:

name: Deploy to Cloudflare with Wrangler

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or 'master' depending on your default branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Wrangler
        run: npm install -g wrangler

      - name: Deploy to Cloudflare
        run: wrangler deploy
        env:
          CF_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
5. Push Changes
Commit and push:

git add wrangler.json .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Set up automatic Wrangler deploy"
git push origin main
GitHub Actions will run and deploy automatically.

If you want, I can also tweak this so it only deploys the maloneuniversity.org folder from your big MRELLC-WEBSITES repo instead of the whole thing.
That way, other projects in the repo won’t affect your school site’s deployment.

You said:
Is my cloudflare_worker folder supposed to be in my website folder? Because mine ain't. I have cloudflare folder at same level as website folder.
ChatGPT said:
If your Cloudflare Worker folder is separate from your website folder, that’s fine — but Wrangler needs to know where the files to deploy are.

Right now you have something like this:

/Projects
   ├── MRELLC-WEBSITES
   │    ├── maloneuniversity.org   ← website files
   │    └── cloudflare             ← worker scripts/config
Wrangler doesn’t magically guess “oh, deploy the HTML from that other folder.”
You have two options:

Option 1: Move Worker Config into Website Folder
Keep everything in maloneuniversity.org:

maloneuniversity.org/
   ├── wrangler.json
   ├── index.html
   ├── css/
   ├── js/
   └── ...
This way, wrangler deploy run inside maloneuniversity.org will just work.

Option 2: Keep Separate but Point Wrangler to Website
If you want to keep your Cloudflare Worker files in cloudflare/, edit the wrangler.json inside that folder:

{
  "name": "maloneuniversity",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-08-09",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "../maloneuniversity.org"
  }
}
Then run:

cd cloudflare
wrangler deploy
This tells Wrangler: “The worker is here, but the static assets live over there.”

If you’re going to set up GitHub Actions for auto-deploy, Option 1 is cleaner because the action will just run from the website folder.

I can restructure your folders so your GitHub → Wrangler pipeline works without you having to move them manually every time. Would you like me to set it up that way?

PS C:\Projects\mrellc-websites\maloneuniversity.org>
ChatGPT said:
Got it — so in your case:

Website folder:
C:\Projects\mrellc-websites\maloneuniversity.org (this has all the HTML, CSS, etc.)

Cloudflare Worker folder:
C:\Projects\mrellc-websites\cloudflare (separate from website folder)

Right now Wrangler will only work if you run it from inside the folder that has wrangler.json and that file correctly points to your website files.

What to do
Since you already have a wrangler.json inside maloneuniversity.org, we can make that the deploy folder and forget about the separate cloudflare directory for this site.

Your wrangler.json inside maloneuniversity.org should look like this:

{
  "name": "maloneuniversity",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-08-09",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "."
  }
}
This tells Wrangler:

“Deploy the current folder (.) as a static site.”

Then, when you want to deploy manually:

cd C:\Projects\mrellc-websites\maloneuniversity.org
wrangler deploy
For automatic GitHub → Wrangler deploys
We’d have the GitHub Action run from this same folder so it pushes only maloneuniversity.org to Cloudflare.
That way, the separate cloudflare folder is irrelevant — your live site will come straight from the website’s own folder.

Do you want me to go ahead and rewrite the GitHub Action so it CDs into maloneuniversity.org before deploying? That’ll keep the automation clean.

You said:
Excellent, it deployed once I created wrangler.json and used bash script.
ChatGPT said:
Nice — that means your wrangler.json is working and Wrangler finally knows where your site lives. 🚀

If it’s deploying fine manually with your bash script, the next step is just wiring that same logic into GitHub Actions so you don’t have to touch a terminal at all — every push to your repo will update maloneuniversity.org.

Since your working command is basically:

cd maloneuniversity.org && wrangler deploy
…the GitHub Action just needs to do the same thing on the cloud.

I can give you that exact workflow file so it runs automatically and uses your CF_API_TOKEN secret. That way your “deploy” button becomes git push.

Want me to drop that GitHub Actions file in for you?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here’s the GitHub Actions workflow that will deploy maloneuniversity.org automatically every time you push to your repo.

1. Add Secret to GitHub
Before the workflow works, you need your Cloudflare API token in GitHub:

In your Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token.
Use the “Edit Cloudflare Workers” template.

Name it something like GitHub Wrangler Deploy.

Copy the generated token.

In your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.

Name: CF_API_TOKEN

Value: paste your token.

2. Create Workflow File
In your repo, make this file:
.github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy maloneuniversity.org to Cloudflare

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # change if your default branch is not "main"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Wrangler
        run: npm install -g wrangler

      - name: Deploy with Wrangler
        working-directory: maloneuniversity.org
        run: wrangler deploy
        env:
          CF_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
3. Commit & Push
In PowerShell or Git Bash:

git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Action for Cloudflare deploy"
git push
Once pushed, GitHub Actions will:

Checkout your repo.

Install Wrangler.

cd into maloneuniversity.org.

Run wrangler deploy with your secret token.

Your site will auto-update every time you push changes to main.

Do you want me to also make it only deploy when files inside maloneuniversity.org/ change, so other parts of your big repo don’t trigger a deploy? That way your other websites won’t affect this one.

You said:
hmm... PS C:\Projects\MRELLC-WEBSITES\maloneuniversity.org> cd c://projects/mgu
PS C:\projects\mgu> git add cloudflare-worker/worker.js
fatal: pathspec 'cloudflare-worker/worker.js' did not match any files
PS C:\projects\mgu> git commit -m "Update Worker navbar links"
On branch main

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .env
        supabase/
        test-function.js

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
PS C:\projects\mgu> git push
fatal: No configured push destination.
Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using

    git remote add <name> <url>

and then push using the remote name

    git push <name>

PS C:\projects\mgu>
ChatGPT said:
Yeah — right now your mgu repo hasn’t even had its first commit and isn’t linked to GitHub yet, which is why:

git add cloudflare-worker/worker.js failed (because that path doesn’t exist in mgu).

git push failed (because no remote GitHub repo is set).

Here’s how to fix it and get mgu pushing to GitHub
1️⃣ Make sure your mgu folder has the files you actually want to version-control
Move or copy in your maloneuniversity.org folder or your cloudflare Worker code — whatever you want tracked in this repo.

2️⃣ Initialize Git
In PowerShell:

cd C:\projects\mgu
git init
3️⃣ Add your GitHub remote
Since your repo URL is
https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.git
you run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.git
4️⃣ Add and commit files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
5️⃣ Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Once that’s done, GitHub will have your mgu repo with the files inside it, and the GitHub Actions workflow I gave you earlier will be able to run.

Do you want me to structure the mgu repo so it only contains maloneuniversity.org and the deploy workflow? That would make it clean and avoid mixing in unrelated files.

ChatGPT said:
Okay — so now your maloneuniversity.org folder is part of the MRELLC-WEBSITES repo on GitHub under the ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC account.

That means the GitHub Action you committed will run in that repo, but here’s the catch:

Since your workflow file is at

maloneuniversity.org/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
GitHub won’t run it — workflows must be in .github/workflows/ at the root of the repository, not nested inside a subfolder.

Two ways to fix this
Option 1: Move the workflow to repo root
Move the file to:

MRELLC-WEBSITES/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
and update the working-directory in the YAML so it CD’s into maloneuniversity.org before deploying:

name: Deploy maloneuniversity.org to Cloudflare

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Wrangler
        run: npm install -g wrangler

      - name: Deploy with Wrangler
        working-directory: maloneuniversity.org
        run: wrangler deploy
        env:
          CF_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
Option 2: Make maloneuniversity.org its own repo
If you don’t want the action to run for the whole MRELLC-WEBSITES repo, create a separate GitHub repo just for maloneuniversity.org and put the .github/workflows/deploy.yml in its root.
That keeps it clean and only triggers when that site changes.

If you want this to auto-deploy only when files in maloneuniversity.org/ change, I can add a paths: filter to the workflow so other sites in MRELLC-WEBSITES don’t trigger it.

Do you want me to set it so only changes to maloneuniversity.org trigger deploys? That’s the cleanest for your current repo structure.

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Alright — here’s the updated GitHub Actions workflow so it only runs when files inside maloneuniversity.org/ change.

1. Move Workflow to Repo Root
Right now it’s in:

maloneuniversity.org/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
It needs to be moved to:

MRELLC-WEBSITES/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
2. Updated deploy.yml
Put this in the new location:

name: Deploy maloneuniversity.org to Cloudflare

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'maloneuniversity.org/**'  # Only trigger when files in this folder change

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Wrangler
        run: npm install -g wrangler

      - name: Deploy with Wrangler
        working-directory: maloneuniversity.org
        run: wrangler deploy
        env:
          CF_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
3. Commit & Push
From your repo root (MRELLC-WEBSITES):

git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Move workflow to repo root and restrict to maloneuniversity.org changes"
git push
Now:

If you change any file in maloneuniversity.org/, GitHub Actions will deploy.

If you change other websites in the repo, it won’t run.

Do you also want me to add a manual trigger so you can deploy on-demand from the GitHub UI even without pushing code? That’s helpful if you want to redeploy without editing files.

Perfect ✅ — now the workflow is in the correct place and restricted so it only runs when maloneuniversity.org/** changes.

When you push any update inside that folder, GitHub Actions will:

Detect the change.

cd into maloneuniversity.org.

Run wrangler deploy automatically.

You can check the deployment run under GitHub → Actions in your repo.

If you want, I can add a workflow_dispatch block so you can manually redeploy from the GitHub UI even without changing files — super handy for emergency updates or re-runs. Would you like me to add that?
