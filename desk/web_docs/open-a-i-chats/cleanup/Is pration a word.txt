Is pration a word?
ChatGPT said:
"Pration" isn’t a standard English word you’ll find in most modern dictionaries.

The closest real words are:

Prating – meaning "talking foolishly or at tedious length."

Pration (archaic/rare) – historically, it has been used in older English texts as a noun meaning "idle talk" or "prattle," derived from prate. You might see it in writings from the 16th–17th centuries.

So, it’s technically a word, but so outdated that most people today wouldn’t recognize it. It’s like the linguistic equivalent of a dusty attic relic.

Do you want me to dig up a few historical uses of “pration” so you can see it in context?

You said:
"The content creators prated at great length, often serving more as pration merchants rather than true scholarly professors... while Malone quietly built masterclasses." 
ChatGPT said:
That sentence works surprisingly well — you’re blending an archaic word with a modern critique.

A couple of thoughts:

"Pration" fits the sense of "idle or foolish talk," but because it’s rare, most readers won’t immediately know it. If you want to keep it, the unusualness can add flair — but it will read as deliberately old-fashioned or satirical.

Your "pration merchants" phrase is great — it gives the image of people selling hot air rather than real knowledge.

Stylistically, it’s in the same vein as 18th-century pamphleteers who liked dressing down intellectual pretenders.

If you want to make it feel like a sharp, modern jab with an antique twist, you could slightly tighten it:

The content creators prated at great length, serving more as merchants of pration than as true scholars, while Malone quietly built masterclasses.

Would you like me to also give you a couple more punchy variations so “pration” lands harder on the reader?

You said:
yes

Here are some sharpened variations where "pration" really pops and keeps that blend of satirical bite with a hint of antiquity:

1. Elevated mockery

The content creators prated endlessly, peddling pration as though it were wisdom, while Malone quietly built masterclasses.

2. Satirical with rhythm

The content creators prated on, merchants of pration in a marketplace starved for scholarship, while Malone quietly built masterclasses.

3. Short, sharp, and damning

The content creators prated; Malone produced. One trafficked in pration, the other in mastery.

4. Almost pamphlet-style

The content creators prated at length, their pration polished but hollow, while Malone’s work brimmed with substance.

5. Old-meets-modern burn

They prated like seasoned pration merchants, spinning words into nothing, while Malone quietly forged something worth keeping.

If you want, I can also give you an 18th-century-style mock editorial paragraph using “pration” that could slot right into your Black Papers and feel historically authentic. That would make it hit even harder.

Here’s an 18th-century-style mock editorial you could drop right into a Black Paper, with “pration” woven in so it feels historically authentic but still stings in a modern context:

On the Present Faction of Prationers

It is a melancholy observation that our present age abounds not with scholars, but with prationers — those industrious traffickers in empty sound, who mistake the clatter of tongues for the cultivation of minds. These merchants of pration ply their trade with great vigour, adorning their discourse with foreign phrases and fashionable absurdities, as if novelty could serve in place of knowledge. Meanwhile, the patient labourer in true learning — the Malone of our day — is left to toil in obscurity, erecting works of enduring utility while the public purse is squandered upon the gaudy stalls of verbal mountebanks.

If you like, I can modernize this into a satirical op-ed hybrid so it reads as both timeless and immediately relevant to today’s content-creator culture. That way you get the bite of pamphleteering and the clarity for a 2025 reader.

You said:
They have many views but do not talk about what they are supposed to. They are modern mountebanks who distract from what is valuable as they offer pration as empowerment. 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a tightened and stylized version of what you wrote, keeping the satirical edge while making “pration” land harder:

Modern Mountebanks

They attract multitudes of views, yet seldom address what they profess to teach. These are the modern mountebanks, diverting attention from what is truly valuable, offering pration dressed as empowerment, and mistaking applause for achievement.

If you want, I can also fuse this with the 18th-century pamphlet tone from before, so it sounds like an old-world observer roasting 21st-century influencers. That pairing could make it perfect for your Black Papers’ voice.

You said:
I need something more modern and sharp. I want to call them out for purposely misleading the public and causing havok. 
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you want it modern, sharp, and accusatory, with zero ambiguity about intent.
Here’s a reworked version that directly calls them out for deliberate harm:

They chase views, not truth — speaking around the point, never to it. These modern mountebanks know exactly what they are doing: flooding the public square with pration to distract from what matters, sowing confusion while presenting themselves as liberators. Their currency is outrage, their product is misdirection, and their impact is havoc.

I can also make an even more compressed, quotable version if you want this to work as a repeatable rallying line in your materials. That way it’s short enough to sting but broad enough to apply widely.

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a compressed, quotable version with bite:

Modern mountebanks sell pration as empowerment, misdirect the public on purpose, and profit from the havoc they cause.

Or even sharper:

They deal in pration, not truth — and chaos is their business model.

If you want, I can give you a set of 5 variations like this so you have a whole arsenal of one-liners for your Black Papers.
