I am still having trouble diagnosing my stack. Website is not updating live site even though github is storing files online. 
ChatGPT said:
Gotcha — so GitHub is updating fine, but Cloudflare (or wherever you’re hosting) isn’t showing the changes on the live site.

When that happens in your kind of setup (GitHub → Cloudflare Worker/Pages), it’s usually one of these:

1. Wrong repo or branch is connected to deploy

Double-check in Cloudflare Pages settings which GitHub repo and branch it’s watching.

If you have two copies of maloneuniversity.org (epsilon / alpha), Cloudflare might still be linked to the old repo.

2. GitHub Actions workflow not triggering or failing silently

If you’re using a GitHub Action to run wrangler publish, check the Actions tab on GitHub for your deploy workflow.

Make sure the logs say “Published” or “Deployment successful” — sometimes a secret (API token) change or wrangler.toml mismatch will cause it to exit without error.

3. Cloudflare build caching / asset caching

Cloudflare aggressively caches assets.

Even if the deployment succeeds, you may be seeing old versions because Cloudflare’s CDN still has them stored.

Run: Cloudflare → Caching → Purge Everything

Then hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows).

4. Worker or Pages project misrouting

If you’re using a Worker to proxy or serve the site, make sure its fetch or KV store isn’t returning old content.

If you switched repos but kept the same Worker route, it might still be serving the old static bundle.

5. wrangler.toml path issue

In a manual deploy setup, if wrangler.toml points to the wrong directory (main instead of dist), Cloudflare will push the wrong files.

Verify main or pages_build_output_dir points to the folder that actually has your updated HTML/CSS.

I can walk you through a quick "stack sanity check":

Which service is actually hosting your domain? (Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Worker, or Netlify?)

Is your deployment automated via GitHub → Cloudflare integration, or are you running wrangler publish manually?

Do you have more than one repo with the same files that Cloudflare might be using by mistake?

If you tell me those three, I can pinpoint exactly where the chain is breaking.

You said:
I want to start over with a clean build.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — a fresh start will clear out any “mystery wiring” between GitHub and Cloudflare.

Here’s the safest reset & rebuild process for your stack:

Step 1 — Backup your local project
Make sure you have your local copy of maloneuniversity.org with all the latest changes.

Optional: zip it or commit everything to GitHub just in case.

Step 2 — Disconnect old builds
Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages.

Find your current project for maloneuniversity.org.

Delete the Pages project (or Worker, if you’re serving through one).

This will not delete your GitHub repo, only the hosting connection.

If you also had a Worker serving the site, delete or disable it in Workers & Routes.

Step 3 — Purge DNS & Caching
In Cloudflare → Caching → "Purge Everything" to clear stale assets.

In Cloudflare → DNS, make sure any A/CNAME records for the site point to the new Pages project when we create it.

Step 4 — Create a fresh Cloudflare Pages project
Go to Cloudflare Pages → Create a project.

Select your GitHub account.

Pick the correct repo (the one you want to keep, likely EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu).

Choose the correct branch (main).

Build settings:

Framework: None (static site)

Build command: leave blank unless you use a bundler

Output directory: wherever your HTML is (often /, dist, or public).

Step 5 — Fresh deploy
Let Cloudflare Pages build from your GitHub branch.

Wait for the “Deployment successful” message.

Visit the preview URL first (before assigning the custom domain).

Step 6 — Attach your domain
In Custom Domains → Add maloneuniversity.org.

Cloudflare will auto-create the correct DNS record (CNAME to Pages).

SSL/TLS → Set to Full or Full (strict).

Step 7 — Confirm live updates
Edit a file in your repo, push to main, and watch Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy.

If changes appear on preview but not live domain, purge cache and hard refresh.

If you want, I can give you a bulletproof “reset script” for local + GitHub + Cloudflare so this never gets tangled again.

Do you want me to include that with manual wrangler publish or keep it 100% GitHub → Pages auto-build?

You said:
100% GitHub → Pages auto-build
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — if you’re going 100% GitHub → Cloudflare Pages auto-build, we can strip out all the wrangler complexity, Workers routes, and manual publish steps.

Here’s how we’ll do a full clean rebuild with only the Pages integration:

Clean Rebuild Plan — GitHub → Cloudflare Pages
(No Workers, no wrangler, just automatic deploys)

1 — Back up
Make sure your local folder (maloneuniversity.org) is up to date.

Commit and push everything to your real main repo:

git add .
git commit -m "Final backup before clean rebuild"
git push origin main
2 — Remove old Cloudflare setup
Cloudflare → Pages

Delete your existing maloneuniversity.org project.

Cloudflare → Workers

If you had a Worker serving the site, delete it or remove its routes.

Cloudflare → Caching → Purge Everything

Wipe old cached assets from the CDN.

3 — Start fresh in Cloudflare Pages
Go to Cloudflare → Pages → Create a Project.

Click Connect to Git.

Authorize/select your EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu repo.

Build settings:

Framework preset: None

Build command: leave empty (if just HTML/CSS/JS)

Build output directory: / or wherever your index.html is (no subfolder)

Click Save and Deploy.

4 — Test before connecting domain
Cloudflare will give you a .pages.dev preview link (example: mgu.pages.dev).

Make a change in GitHub (like updating a line in index.html) → commit → push → check if preview updates automatically.

5 — Connect your custom domain
In Cloudflare Pages project → Custom domains → Add maloneuniversity.org.

Let Cloudflare add the correct CNAME in DNS.

SSL/TLS → Set to Full (strict).

6 — Ongoing workflow
All you do from now on is:

git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push origin main
Cloudflare Pages will rebuild automatically from GitHub.

Extra tip — Avoiding future “stale site” problems
Always work from one repo only.

Delete unused duplicates from GitHub so you can’t accidentally link the wrong one.

Check Cloudflare Pages’ Settings → Git integration to confirm the correct repo and branch are still linked.

If you want, I can also give you a tiny README.md to keep inside your repo with these steps so you never need to re-diagnose the stack again.

Do you want me to make that for you?

You said:
I saved everything to a usb. I want to make a completely fresh site.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — since you’ve got everything backed up to USB, we can nuke the old setup entirely and rebuild from scratch without any leftover config, cache, or repo confusion.

Here’s the full “wipe & rebuild” plan:

Phase 1 — Wipe Everything
On GitHub

Delete the old repos (EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu and any duplicates).

Make sure there’s no repo on either GitHub account that’s tied to maloneuniversity.org.

On Cloudflare

Pages → delete all existing projects for the site.

Workers → remove any Worker or route that was serving the domain.

DNS → delete any CNAME/A record that points to old hosting.

Caching → “Purge Everything”.

Phase 2 — Build a Fresh Local Folder
On your PC, create a brand-new folder:

C:\projects\maloneuniversity
Inside, create a minimal starting site:

index.html
style.css
images/
Example index.html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Malone University</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Malone University</h1>
  <p>Fresh build — deployed via GitHub → Cloudflare Pages</p>
</body>
</html>
Phase 3 — Create a New GitHub Repo
Go to GitHub → New repository.

Name it:

maloneuniversity.org
Do NOT add a README, .gitignore, or license (we’ll push from local).

Phase 4 — Push Local Site to GitHub
From your new project folder:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/maloneuniversity.org.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial fresh build"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Phase 5 — Connect to Cloudflare Pages
In Cloudflare Pages → Create project → Connect to Git.

Pick your new repo maloneuniversity.org.

Framework preset: None.

Build command: leave blank.

Output directory: /.

Deploy.

Phase 6 — Connect Domain
In Pages → Custom domains, add maloneuniversity.org.

Let Cloudflare automatically create the DNS CNAME.

Set SSL/TLS to Full (strict).

Once this is done, you’ll have a completely clean hosting chain:
Local → GitHub (main branch) → Cloudflare Pages → Live domain.
No Workers, no wrangler, no legacy files.

If you want, I can prepare a ready-to-use HTML/CSS starter template so your brand-new site already has the light/dark mode toggle and mobile nav from your previous version — but without any of the old messy config.

Do you want me to make that fresh starter package?

You said:
this says something weird about alpha group having ownership but is shouldn't. I will check github but all keys were destroyed with removing old repo: 
PS C:\Users\Joseph> cd c:/mgu
PS C:\mgu> git init
Reinitialized existing Git repository in C:/mgu/.git/
PS C:\mgu> git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/maloneuniversity.org.git
error: remote origin already exists.
PS C:\mgu> git add .
PS C:\mgu> git commit -m "Initial fresh build"
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
PS C:\mgu> git branch -M main
PS C:\mgu> git push -u origin main
remote: Permission to EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/Malone-Global-University.git denied to ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/Malone-Global-University.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
PS C:\mgu>


ChatGPT said:
Ah — I see what’s going on.
Even though you deleted repos and API keys, your local git folder is still linked to the old Alpha Group repo, so Git is trying to push there.

The key clue:

remote: Permission to EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/Malone-Global-University.git denied to ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC.
That means your local .git config is pointing to the old repo URL and is still authenticated under the old GitHub account.

How to fix
We’ll remove the wrong remote and replace it with the new one:

cd c:/mgu
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/maloneuniversity.org.git
Then push to the new repo:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial fresh build"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
If it still asks for ALPHA-GROUP credentials
That means your GitHub login cached in Windows is still tied to the Alpha Group account.

To clear it on Windows:

Open Control Panel → Credential Manager.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Remove any saved entries for github.com.

Next time you push, it’ll prompt for your GitHub username/password or token — use the EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC credentials.

If you want, I can also give you the command that wipes the entire local git history so this folder is completely unlinked from Alpha Group and starts fresh.

Do you want to do that instead of just changing the remote?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Alright — if you want a total local git reset so there’s no trace of Alpha Group, here’s how to do it.
This will keep your files but completely remove all git history, remotes, and credentials from this folder.

1 — Remove all git history
cd c:/mgu
rmdir /s /q .git
(This deletes the hidden .git folder — the thing that stores all commits, branches, and remotes.)

2 — Start a fresh git repo
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/maloneuniversity.org.git
3 — Clear old GitHub login from Windows
Open Control Panel → Credential Manager.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Remove any saved entries for github.com or git:.

Close and reopen your terminal.

4 — Commit and push cleanly
git add .
git commit -m "Initial fresh build"
git push -u origin main
When prompted, log in using your EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC GitHub credentials or personal access token.

This will give you:

✅ No link to Alpha Group repo

✅ No leftover git history

✅ Clean push to your new repo

If you want, after this push, I can walk you directly into setting up the new Cloudflare Pages build so it’s connected to this repo and deploys automatically.

Do you want me to do that next?

ChatGPT said:
This means Git can’t find the repo you’re trying to push to — so either:

The repo doesn’t exist yet under EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC

The name in the URL is wrong (capitalization counts!)

You don’t have permission for that repo.

Here’s how to fix it:

Step 1 — Check the repo exists
Go to GitHub and sign in as EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC.

Make sure there is a repository exactly named:

maloneuniversity.org
(Or whatever name you actually chose — GitHub URLs are case-sensitive.)

If it doesn’t exist, create it:

Click New Repository

Name it maloneuniversity.org

Leave it empty (no README, no .gitignore)

Create it.

Step 2 — Update your remote to the exact repo URL
Replace the remote with the exact name from GitHub:

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/maloneuniversity.org.git
Step 3 — Commit & Push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial fresh build"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
When prompted, log in as EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC.

Do you want me to give you the exact repo URL after searching your GitHub org so we’re 100% sure it’s correct before you try again? That would avoid another “Repo not found” error.

You said:
a popup in terminal asks me to sign in. I should not have delted all credentials.
ChatGPT said:
Right — when you deleted the old credentials from Windows Credential Manager, you wiped all stored GitHub logins.

That’s actually good here, because now you can make sure the terminal is logging in as EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC instead of Alpha Group.

Here’s what’s happening:

When Git asks you to push, it doesn’t have a saved login anymore.

It opens your browser for GitHub authentication.

If your browser is signed in as the wrong account, GitHub will try to authorize that account — and if that account doesn’t own the repo, you get the “Repository not found” error.

How to fix this
Close the popup and cancel the push.

In your browser, log out of GitHub completely.

Log back in as EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC (the account that owns the new repo).

In your terminal, try:

git push -u origin main
It should pop up the login window again — this time, approve it with the correct account.

If you want, I can also give you the Personal Access Token method instead of browser login, which avoids all this account-switching mess and works every time.

Do you want me to set you up with the token method?

You said:
PS C:\mgu> rmdir /s /q .git
Remove-Item : A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument '/q'.
At line:1 char:1
+ rmdir /s /q .git
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [Remove-Item], ParameterBindingException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PositionalParameterNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.RemoveItemCommand

PS C:\mgu>
ChatGPT said:
Ah — that’s because you’re in PowerShell, not classic Command Prompt, so the /s /q flags don’t work.

In PowerShell, the equivalent to remove .git is:

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
Steps:
cd C:\mgu
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/maloneuniversity.org.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial fresh build"
git push -u origin main
When it asks you to log in, make sure your browser is signed in as EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC, not Alpha Group.

Do you want me to also walk you through generating a Personal Access Token so you can paste it in and skip the browser popup entirely? That way, Git will always use the right account.

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Alright — we’ll set up GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) auth so you can push without browser popups or accidentally using the wrong account.

Step 1 — Generate a token in GitHub
Sign in to GitHub as EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC.

Go to: Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
(Or click: https://github.com/settings/tokens)

Click Generate new token → Generate new token (classic).

Give it a name like GitHub Push Token.

Expiration: choose 90 days or “No expiration” if you want long-term.

Scopes: check only:

repo (full control of private repos)

workflow (if you want GitHub Actions to run automatically)

Click Generate token.

Copy the token somewhere safe — you will not be able to see it again.

Step 2 — Remove old credentials
Open Control Panel → Credential Manager

Go to Windows Credentials.

Remove any entries for github.com.

Step 3 — Push with the token
When you next push:

git push -u origin main
Git will ask for a username and password:

Username → your GitHub username (EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC)

Password → paste the token (not your real GitHub password)

If you check “Remember credentials,” it’ll save this token and use it automatically.

Step 4 — Verify
Run:

git remote -v
You should see:

origin  https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/maloneuniversity.org.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/maloneuniversity.org.git (push)
If you want, I can combine this token method with a fresh repo push script so you can just paste one set of commands in and it’ll link, commit, and push in one go.

Do you want me to make that one-liner script for you?
