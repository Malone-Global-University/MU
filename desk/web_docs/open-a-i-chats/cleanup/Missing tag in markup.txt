Yes — you’re right that there’s a missing closing tag, but the problem is a bit bigger than just a </ul> — the nesting itself is invalid HTML.

Right now you have:

<ol>
  <li>Political</li>
  <ul> ... </ul>
That’s illegal because an <ul> (or any block-level element) can’t be a sibling of a <li> — it has to be inside the <li>.

The correct structure should be:

<ol>
  <li>
    Political
    <ul>
      <li>Local government underrepresentation</li>
      <li>Voter suppression laws</li>
      <li>Redistricting/gerrymandering</li>
      <li>Environmental and health issues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Economic
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of Black-controlled credit unions or investment networks at scale</li>
      <li>Predatory lending in Black neighborhoods</li>
      <li>Lack of business incubators owned and run by Black entrepreneurs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <!-- Repeat the same pattern for the rest -->
</ol>
So the “missing” part isn’t just </ul> — each <ul> needs to be nested inside the <li> it belongs to, and each <li> must have a proper closing </li> after the </ul>.

If you’d like, I can rewrite your entire <section> so it’s valid HTML and keeps the exact same look. That way your list will also pass HTML validators and be future-proof.

You said:
it has to be inside the <li>.? I don't get it.
ChatGPT said:
Yep — that’s the key rule here.

Think of an <li> (list item) like a “box” in your ordered list (<ol>).
Whatever content belongs to that item — text, paragraphs, even another list — has to be inside that <li>’s box before you close it with </li>.

Right now your markup says:

<ol>
  <li>Political</li>
  <ul> ... </ul> <!-- ❌ This is outside the list item -->
</ol>
The browser will try to render it, but in HTML’s official rules, <ul> here is floating between <li> items, which isn’t valid.

The correct pattern is:

<ol>
  <li>
    Political
    <ul>
      <li>Local government underrepresentation</li>
      <li>Voter suppression laws</li>
      <li>Redistricting/gerrymandering</li>
      <li>Environmental and health issues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
Notice:

The <li> starts with “Political”.

Then, still inside that <li>, we open the <ul> with the sub-points.

We close the </ul> first, then close the parent </li>.

If you want, I can rewrite your whole original list with this correct nesting so you can copy-paste it in one shot. That way you won’t have to fix each category manually.

yes please

Here’s your <section> rewritten with correct HTML nesting so every <ul> is inside the right <li> and properly closed:

This version will:

Validate as proper HTML.

Keep the exact same visual appearance in browsers.

Be easier for screen readers to navigate (nested lists are semantically correct).

If you want, I can also give you CSS to style the nested <ul> differently so the sub-points stand out more.

You said:
how come the circles are hollow?
ChatGPT said:
Ah — that’s because of the browser’s default list-style for <ul> elements.

By default:

<ol> numbers items (1., 2., 3.)

<ul> uses disc (●) for top-level unordered lists, but circle (○) for nested <ul> inside another list.

That’s why your sub-lists are showing hollow circles — they’re nested inside an <ol>.

If you want them to be filled dots, you can override the default style with CSS:

ol ul {
  list-style-type: disc; /* Makes them solid dots */
}
If you want something else, like squares or custom icons:

ol ul {
  list-style-type: square; /* Solid squares */
}
Or even completely custom symbols with list-style-image or pseudo-elements.

If you’d like, I can give you a clean CSS snippet so your <ul> sub-points always have filled dots no matter how deep they’re nested. That way they stay consistent visually.
