what git commands should i use to push changes to PS C:\Users\Joseph> cd c://projects/mgu

If your project is already a Git repository (which it should be if you’ve cloned it), you can push changes from

PS C:\Users\Joseph> cd c://projects/mgu
using this sequence:

# 1. Move into your project folder
cd C:\Projects\mgu

# 2. See which files changed
git status

# 3. Stage all changes (or specify files instead of ".")
git add .

# 4. Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

# 5. Push to the main branch on GitHub
git push origin main
If you haven’t set the remote yet (for example if this is a new local repo), you’d first do:

git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.git
Do you want me to give you a one-line shortcut command so you can stage, commit, and push in one go? That can save you time.

yes

Here’s the quick one-liner you can run from inside

C:\Projects\mgu

git add . && git commit -m "update" && git push origin main
You can replace "update" with any commit message you want.

If you run this often, we could even set up a Git alias so you can just type something like:

git quick "message here"
and it would do the whole add → commit → push for you. Would you like me to set that up?
