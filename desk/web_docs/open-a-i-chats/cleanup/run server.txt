If you just want to preview a static HTML/CSS/JS site at localhost:8000 before pushing it live, you can spin up a simple local web server.
The exact method depends on what you have installed. Here are the easiest options:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Python 3 (most computers already have it)
Navigate to your site folder in the terminal/command prompt:

cd path/to/your/project
python -m http.server 8000
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Node.js (if you have it installed)
Install the simple HTTP server:

npm install -g http-server
Run it from your project folder:

cd path/to/your/project
http-server -p 8000
3Ô∏è‚É£ VS Code ‚ÄúLive Server‚Äù extension (super convenient)

Open your project folder in VS Code

Install the Live Server extension

Right-click your index.html ‚Üí Open with Live Server

This will open your page in a browser with auto-refresh when you save changes.

üí° Important:
Opening index.html directly in your browser via ‚Äúdouble-click‚Äù won‚Äôt mimic a real server environment ‚Äî relative paths, scripts, and fetch calls may break. A local server is safer for testing.

Do you want me to give you a one-line command for running this directly from your Malone University project folder? That way you can just paste and go.
