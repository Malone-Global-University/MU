The issue is that in Git Bash (or any Bash shell), Windows-style paths like

C:\Projects\MRELLC-WEBSITES\maloneuniversity.org
don‚Äôt work directly unless you either:

Option 1 ‚Äì Use forward slashes
cd /c/Projects/MRELLC-WEBSITES/maloneuniversity.org
In Git Bash, C:\ becomes /c/.

Backslashes (\) must be replaced with forward slashes (/).

Option 2 ‚Äì Quote and escape the backslashes
cd "C:\\Projects\\MRELLC-WEBSITES\\maloneuniversity.org"
Here, you need double backslashes because a single \ is treated as an escape character.

Option 3 ‚Äì Use Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell
If you want to keep using the Windows C:\ style without converting:

cd C:\Projects\MRELLC-WEBSITES\maloneuniversity.org
(But that means leaving Git Bash.)

If you want, I can give you a one-line Git Bash command that will always take you to your maloneuniversity.org folder without typing the full path every time. Would you like that?

I see two problems here:

You tried to cd into a file (deploy.yml) instead of a folder ‚Äî cd is for directories only.
If you want to open deploy.yml, you‚Äôll need to use a text editor command instead (e.g., nano, vim, or code if you have VS Code).

Example for VS Code:

code /c/Projects/MRELLC-WEBSITES/maloneuniversity.org/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
Path formatting in Git Bash

Replace C:\ with /c/

Always use forward slashes / instead of backslashes \

No // unless you mean a network path

So for your folder:

cd /c/Projects/MRELLC-WEBSITES/maloneuniversity.org
If your goal is to edit deploy.yml, the correct Git Bash command would be:

nano /c/Projects/MRELLC-WEBSITES/maloneuniversity.org/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
or

code /c/Projects/MRELLC-WEBSITES/maloneuniversity.org/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
(if VS Code is installed and in your PATH)

Do you want me to give you a shortcut command so you can just type goto malone and jump straight into that folder anytime? That would save you from these long paths.

$ git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml

‚úÖ Perfect ‚Äî now you‚Äôre in the right directory, and your git add command looks correct.

At this point, your next typical Git steps would be:

git commit -m "Add or update deploy.yml workflow"
git push origin main
That will:

Save the change in your local Git history (commit)

Send it to GitHub (push) so Netlify/GitHub Actions can see it

Do you want me to check that your deploy.yml is correctly set up for Netlify deployment before you push? That way we don‚Äôt break the pipeline.

You said:
how do I check it was deployed as there was no confirmation text afterwards?
ChatGPT said:
When you run:

git add ...
git commit ...
git push origin main
Git itself won‚Äôt print anything about deployment ‚Äî it only tells you whether your changes were sent to GitHub.

Since your site is deployed via GitHub Actions and/or Netlify, the deployment status is shown in those services, not in the terminal.

Here‚Äôs how you can check:

1. Check on GitHub
Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click the "Actions" tab.

Look for your deploy.yml workflow run ‚Äî it should say "In progress", "Success", or "Failed".

Click it for logs to see exactly what happened.

2. Check on Netlify
Log in to your Netlify dashboard.

Select your maloneuniversity.org site.

Go to the "Deploys" tab.

You‚Äôll see each deploy event ‚Äî it should match the time you pushed your commit.

If it failed, there will be error logs.

3. Quick check in browser
Visit your site at

https://maloneuniversity.org
Refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R to force a fresh load.

Look for your recent changes.

If you want, I can add a notification step to your deploy.yml so it prints ‚ÄúDeployment complete‚Äù to your terminal or sends you an email/Slack alert when the site is live. That way you don‚Äôt have to guess in the future.

Got it ‚Äî your push worked fine, but Git is telling you that the GitHub repository URL changed.

Specifically, your remote still points to:

https://github.com/Gamma-mrellc/MRELLC-WEBSITES.git
but the repo was moved to:

https://github.com/ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC/MRELLC-WEBSITES.git
That means:

Your commit did push successfully.

GitHub probably redirected it automatically this time.

You should update your local remote so you‚Äôre not relying on redirects.

Fix your remote URL
Run:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC/MRELLC-WEBSITES.git
Check it worked:

git remote -v
How to see if it deployed
Since this was a GitHub Action for Cloudflare deploy, you can:

On GitHub

Go to your repo: https://github.com/ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC/MRELLC-WEBSITES

Click the Actions tab.

Look for the ‚ÄúCloudflare deploy‚Äù workflow run.

Click into it and check the logs.

On Cloudflare

Log into your Cloudflare dashboard.

Select your site (maloneuniversity.org).

Check the ‚ÄúDeployments‚Äù or ‚ÄúPages‚Äù section for the latest build status.

If you want, I can walk you through adding a GitHub Actions status badge to your repo so you can see at a glance if the deploy succeeded right from your README. That way you don‚Äôt have to click into Actions every time.
