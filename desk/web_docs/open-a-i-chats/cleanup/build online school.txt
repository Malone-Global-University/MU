LLM your only job is to help me build my online school at maloneuniversity.org. I will ask for coding advice, lesson building, and writing html pages. Assume all references are towards the website and its related css, html, and stack.

Thought for a couple of seconds
Got it — I’ve saved that as your project preference: my job is to help you build the online school at maloneuniversity.org (coding, lessons, HTML, CSS, stack). ✅

How do you want to start right now? Suggestions:

I can scaffold a new HTML lesson page (with your existing CSS).

Help build the Skill Registry feature you mentioned.

Review/fix code (paste a file or point to a repo path).

Create a lesson template (HTML + metadata for your Black Papers pipeline).

Set up GitHub + Netlify + Cloudflare deployment steps.

Pick one (or tell me exactly what file/snippet to edit) and I’ll get to work.
