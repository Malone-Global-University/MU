how do I make a custom charachter like ✅ that has a mgu logo on it I can use to stamp terminal output like: ("✅ Generated blog index");
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — you want a custom stamp symbol (like ✅) but with your own MGU logo that you can print in the terminal (e.g., ("✅ Generated blog index")).

There are a few approaches depending on how fancy you want it:

1. Unicode + Emoji (easy, but limited)
✅ works because it’s a Unicode character. If you wanted your own logo to be like that, it would need to exist in Unicode — but making a new Unicode character is essentially impossible for private use.

👉 So this won’t work unless you’re happy using an existing Unicode character (like ⚜, ✦, ⚡, etc.) and branding it as your “MGU stamp.”

2. ASCII/ANSI Art Logo (works everywhere in terminal)
You can create a small ASCII version of your logo and print it with colors.

Example in Python:

GREEN = "\033[92m"
RESET = "\033[0m"

MGU_LOGO = GREEN + "[MGU]" + RESET

print(f"{MGU_LOGO} Generated blog index")
That would give you:

[MGU] Generated blog index
in green (like ✅).

You can make it fancier:

MGU_LOGO = GREEN + "Ⓜ" + RESET   # or Ⓖ Ⓤ wrapped as your brand
print(f"{MGU_LOGO} Blog index built!")
3. Custom SVG/PNG → Terminal Stamp (more advanced)
If you want your actual MGU logo art (like an icon), you can:

Convert it to ASCII art (jp2a, caca-utils, or Python ascii-magic).

Print that ASCII version in your terminal.

Example (ASCII logo stub):

╔═╗╔═╗╦ ╦
║ ║║ ║╚╦╝
╚═╝╚═╝ ╩   MGU
Then prefix logs with it:

print(f"{MGU_LOGO} ✅ Blog index built")
4. Fonts with Private Use Area (pro-level)
If you really want ✅ but with your logo inside, you can:

Create a custom font (using FontForge).

Map your logo to a Unicode PUA (Private Use Area) character.

Install that font locally.

Print that symbol (e.g., \uE000 → shows your logo).

Downside: Only machines with your font installed will display it correctly.

✅ Best Practical Option for You Now:
Use colored ASCII/emoji + [MGU] as a "stamp" (Option 2).

Example:

print("✅ [MGU] Blog index generated")
Do you want me to design a mini ASCII art MGU logo for you to paste into your code as the stamp?

I want a char set like the man who made Arial but with a custom logo that says mgu with school colors of navy and gold. I want it to look like an emoji and print on my terminal. I will then take screenshots of code and display on website or social media. This is to be a proprietary font set used only by MGU terminals.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, now I see exactly what you want: not just a little ASCII hack, but a real font set where “MGU” exists as its own glyph (like ✅), styled in your school colors (navy + gold), and usable in your terminal. Essentially, you’d be doing what Arial’s designer did — making a proprietary typeface — but instead of a whole alphabet, you want emoji-style logomarks.

Here’s the roadmap:

🔨 How to Make Your MGU Emoji-Font
1. Design the glyph (the “MGU” mark)
Use a vector graphics tool (free: Inkscape, paid: Illustrator, Affinity).

Make your “MGU” logo in navy + gold. Keep it simple so it renders small.

Export as SVG.

2. Turn SVG into a font
Tools you can use:

FontForge (open-source, pro-level)

Glyphs (Mac, paid)

BirdFont (simpler, free)

In FontForge:

Create a new font project.

Pick a Unicode slot in the Private Use Area (PUA) (e.g., U+E000).

This is where your custom glyph lives.

Import your SVG logo into that slot.

Adjust spacing/metrics so it behaves like a single emoji.

Export as TTF/OTF.

3. Make it an emoji (color support)
Regular fonts are monochrome. If you want your glyph in navy + gold like an emoji:

Use COLR/CPAL tables (FontForge supports this).

Or make an SVG-in-OpenType font (aka SVG emoji font).

Result: your glyph will display in color, like a real emoji.

4. Install the font on your system
Install the .ttf on your machine.

Set your terminal to use your MGU Emoji Font.

Now typing \uE000 (or whatever slot you used) prints your custom MGU logo instead of a random box.

5. Use it in terminal output
Example in Python:

LOGO = "\uE000"  # MGU stamp
print(f"{LOGO} Blog index generated")
If your terminal font is set to your MGU font, it will show the navy-gold logo instead of ▯.

6. Branding screenshots
Any screenshot from your terminal will show the proprietary MGU emoji-glyph.

Works beautifully for dev blogs, social media posts, and your school’s brand.

✨ Bonus
If you want to go bigger:

Design a whole set of branded emoji-like symbols: 📘 for courses, 🎓 for students, 🛠 for dev, each in navy + gold.

Package as MGU Emoji Font → distributed to team members so their MGU terminals all match.

👉 Question for you:
Do you want me to make a starter SVG “MGU” logo in navy + gold right now, so you can drop it into FontForge and immediately start building your font?

You said:
yes

Thought for 13s
Awesome — here are ready-to-edit SVGs for an “emoji-style” MGU logomark in navy + gold. You can drop any of these into FontForge, then Object to Path (outline) to make color glyphs.

Color palette (feel free to tweak)
MGU Navy: #0B1F3A

MGU Gold: #FFC72C

White: #FFFFFF

1) Circular “emoji badge”
File: mgu-emoji-circle.svg


2) Rounded-square badge (great for tiny sizes)
File: mgu-emoji-rounded.svg


3) Inline stamp (sits nicely with text at ~1em height)
File: mgu-emoji-inline.svg


Make these glyphs work as a color emoji font (FontForge, quick path)
Open & Outline

Open SVG in Inkscape or Illustrator → Path → Object to Path (for each text object).

Save as Plain SVG (keeps geometry clean).

FontForge

File → New

Encoding → Reencode → Unicode BMP (or keep default).

Pick a Private Use Area slot, e.g. U+E000 (double-click that cell).

File → Import your outlined SVG into that glyph cell.

Color layers (COLR/CPAL emoji)

Element → Color Layers… → Enable.

Import the navy shapes to one color layer and gold shapes to another (or just import the whole SVG; FontForge will create layers by fill).

Verify fills match your hex colors.

Metrics

Element → Font Info… → set Em Size (e.g., 1000), Ascent/Descent (e.g., 800/200).

In the glyph window: Metrics → Set Width… (try ~1000). Center visually.

Name & Export

Element → Font Info…

Fontname: MGUEmoji

Family Name: MGU Emoji

Version: 1.000

File → Generate Fonts…

Choose OpenType (CFF) or TTF.

Check OpenType SVG or COLR/CPAL if available (varies by build).

Generate.

Install & Use

Install the .ttf/.otf.

Set your terminal font to MGU Emoji (or create a fallback chain where your terminal tries MGU first).

Print in code using the PUA codepoint:

LOGO = "\uE000"  # your MGU glyph
print(f"{LOGO} Generated blog index")
Tip: Want multiple branded stamps? Put each icon at a new PUA slot:

U+E000 — MGU logo

U+E001 — “success” (MGU + check)

U+E002 — “warn” (MGU + exclamation)

U+E003 — “build” (MGU + hammer)
…all navy/gold, emoji-style.

Next steps I can do for you
Convert these to outlined path SVGs (no fonts needed).

Add a tiny “checkmark” overlay variant for a ✅-like success stamp.

Provide a FontForge project file with glyphs already mapped (U+E000…).

If you want, say the word and I’ll give you:

Path-outlined versions of the three SVGs,

Plus a success variant (MGU + check) ready to import at U+E001.
