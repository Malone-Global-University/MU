How do I add a subdomain named accessibility. maloneuniversity.org to netlify? I have Add a domain to Netlify DNS
Netlify will automatically provision DNS records and wildcard certificates for all subdomains.

Choose domain
Add DNS records
Activate Netlify DNS
Add DNS records (optional)
The DNS records for your Netlify projects will be configured automatically.

Are you using your domain for other services, such as email? No problem! You can add DNS records for those services at any time.

Learn more about DNS records in the docs

No DNS records set up yet.

Add new record
Continue    but want to use cloudflare to handle DNS.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — since you already have Cloudflare handling DNS for maloneuniversity.org, you should not switch to “Netlify DNS” at all.

Instead, you just need to:

1. Set up the subdomain on Netlify
In Netlify, go to Sites → choose your site → Domain settings.

Click Add custom domain.

Enter:

accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
Netlify will tell you what DNS record you need — it will usually be a CNAME pointing to something like:

your-site-name.netlify.app
Do not enable Netlify DNS when it prompts — skip that.

2. Add the CNAME record in Cloudflare
Go to your domain in Cloudflare → DNS tab.

Add a new DNS record:

Type: CNAME

Name: accessibility

Target: <your-site-name>.netlify.app (exactly what Netlify showed you)

Proxy status: 🟠 Proxied is fine, but for fewer SSL headaches you can start with DNS only and switch to proxied later.

Save.

3. Wait for DNS to propagate
This can be near instant with Cloudflare, but allow up to ~15 minutes.

Once Netlify detects the CNAME, it will automatically issue an SSL certificate for accessibility.maloneuniversity.org.

💡 Important:
If you use Cloudflare in proxied mode, Netlify’s automatic HTTPS works fine, but you might see certificate mismatch errors until the SSL is fully provisioned. If that happens, set the record to DNS only until Netlify confirms HTTPS is active, then re-enable the orange cloud.

If you want, I can give you the exact Cloudflare DNS record format for accessibility.maloneuniversity.org so you can just paste it in. Would you like that?

You said:
Okay, I hear you. I need to 1. create a new netlify deployment called accessibility.maloneuniversity.org. 2. This will act as a separate website. 3. Here is where I am confused... In cloudflare point cname towards netlify.app.... All I have in cloudflare is maloneuniveristy.org, no subdomain.
ChatGPT said:
Right — that’s normal.
You don’t see the subdomain in Cloudflare yet because you haven’t created a DNS record for it.

Here’s the clear step-by-step for your case:

1. Create a new site in Netlify
Log into Netlify → Add new site → deploy from Git, drag-and-drop, or however you normally do it.

Once deployed, it will get a random Netlify domain like:

accessibility-mgu.netlify.app
2. Add the subdomain to that site in Netlify
Go to that site’s Domain settings → Add custom domain.

Enter:

accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
Netlify will say:

“Add a CNAME record for accessibility pointing to accessibility-mgu.netlify.app”
(or whatever your actual Netlify domain is).

3. Add the DNS record in Cloudflare
Since Cloudflare is your DNS host, you must create the subdomain record manually:

Go to your domain in Cloudflare Dashboard → DNS tab.

Click Add record.

Fill in:

Type: CNAME

Name: accessibility

Target: accessibility-mgu.netlify.app (exact Netlify domain)

Proxy status:

Start with DNS only (gray cloud) until SSL is active on Netlify.

Once HTTPS works, you can switch to Proxied (orange cloud) if you want Cloudflare features.

Save.

4. Let DNS propagate
Cloudflare DNS is fast — usually seconds to minutes.

Netlify will auto-detect the CNAME and issue an SSL certificate for accessibility.maloneuniversity.org.

💡 Key point:
You never need to “create” the subdomain in Cloudflare before this — it’s created automatically when you add the CNAME record.

If you want, I can write you the exact CNAME line for Cloudflare so you can literally paste it in and be done in 20 seconds. That way there’s zero guesswork.

Gotcha — so you have one big monorepo now, but for this new accessibility.maloneuniversity.org site you want a standalone repo so you can deploy it separately on Netlify.

Since it’s just a single static page right now in /static/accessibility, you basically want to extract that into its own repo with a minimal structure that Netlify can serve as a whole website.

Recommended folder structure for the new repo
Here’s the simplest setup for a small static site:

accessibility/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css   (optional)
├── js/
│   └── script.js    (optional)
├── images/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
How to set it up from your current monorepo
Make a local clone of your new GitHub repo:

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/accessibility.git
cd accessibility
Copy your existing static accessibility page:

From your monorepo:

cp C:/mgu/static/accessibility/* C:/path/to/accessibility-repo/
If it’s a single file called accessibility.html, rename it to index.html so Netlify will serve it as the homepage.

Add optional assets:

If your accessibility page uses a site-wide stylesheet or images from /css, /images, etc., copy those into local css/ and images/ folders.

Update the <link> and <img> paths in your HTML to be relative to this new repo.

Commit and push:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of accessibility site"
git push origin main
Netlify setup
When you deploy this repo in Netlify, set:

Build command: (leave blank for pure static)

Publish directory: / (root of the repo)

Netlify will detect the index.html at root and serve it as the homepage.

💡 Since this is going to be a completely separate deployment, you don’t need any of the mgu monorepo’s folders. Keep it clean and self-contained so Cloudflare → CNAME → Netlify → standalone site just works.

If you want, I can map out the exact copy-and-cleanup process so you don’t accidentally break relative links or styles when moving it from /static/accessibility to the new repo. That’s the most common “gotcha” in this kind of migration.

ChatGPT said:
Got it — your page depends on assets that live outside /static/accessibility in the monorepo (/css/mgu.css, /images/..., /data/main.js).

When you make this a standalone repo for Netlify, those paths won’t exist anymore, so you need to either:

Option 1 — Copy assets into the new repo
Keep everything self-contained so the new site works independently of your main site.

Example folder layout for your new accessibility repo:

accessibility/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── mgu.css
├── data/
│   └── main.js
├── images/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── android-chrome-512x512.png
│   └── ... (any other images used in page or CSS)
└── README.md
Then update the HTML paths in index.html so they’re relative instead of starting with /:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/mgu.css" />
<img src="images/android-chrome-512x512.png" alt="Malone University Logo" />
<script src="data/main.js"></script>
Option 2 — Use absolute URLs to your main site
If you want to keep assets hosted in your main domain’s deployment, you could change:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/mgu.css" />
to:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maloneuniversity.org/css/mgu.css" />
This way the subdomain pulls from your main site’s CSS/JS/images.
Downside: If your main site changes structure or goes down, the accessibility site’s styles break.

Recommendation for you
Since you said this subdomain will be a separate website, I’d go Option 1.
That way you can deploy it to Netlify without depending on the main site, and all links work right away.

If you want, I can rewrite your current HTML so it’s ready to drop into the new repo with relative paths and a matching folder structure so you can literally commit and push without worrying about broken links. That would make the migration painless.

You said:
Interesting. I agree with you but want to be difficult. Is there a way to inject the navbar, footer, and stylesheet using javascript?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you can absolutely “be difficult” 😄 and use JavaScript to inject shared components like the navbar, footer, and stylesheet into your page at runtime.

That’s a mini “component include” system for static HTML.

How it works
Keep your navbar HTML in a separate file, e.g. navbar.html.

Keep your footer HTML in another file, e.g. footer.html.

In your index.html, have empty <div>s where they go.

Use a JavaScript script to:

Load those snippets with fetch()

Insert them into the right spots.

Use JavaScript to dynamically load a <link> tag for your stylesheet.

Example folder
accessibility/
├── index.html
├── partials/
│   ├── navbar.html
│   └── footer.html
├── css/
│   └── mgu.css
└── js/
    └── inject.js
index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Accessibility Statement</title>
</head>
<body>

<div id="navbar"></div>

<main>
  <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
  <p>...your page content...</p>
</main>

<div id="footer"></div>

<script src="js/inject.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
inject.js
// Inject stylesheet
const cssLink = document.createElement('link');
cssLink.rel = 'stylesheet';
cssLink.href = 'css/mgu.css';
document.head.appendChild(cssLink);

// Inject navbar
fetch('partials/navbar.html')
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('navbar').innerHTML = html);

// Inject footer
fetch('partials/footer.html')
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('footer').innerHTML = html);
partials/navbar.html
<nav class="navbar">
  <!-- Your full navbar HTML here -->
</nav>
partials/footer.html
<footer>
  <!-- Your full footer HTML here -->
</footer>
Pros
Single source of truth for navbar/footer across multiple sites.

No need to repeat HTML in every file.

Easy to update styling via a single css/mgu.css.

Cons
Requires JavaScript to be enabled for navbar/footer to show.

Slight flicker on page load (because content is loaded after HTML renders).

Not SEO-friendly for bots that don’t run JS (Google is fine, but others may not be).

If you want, I can take your exact navbar/footer from the monorepo and refactor them into this JS injection setup so your accessibility site auto-pulls them without you copying styles or markup manually. That would make it both “difficult” and DRY.

You said:
Well I want to be extra "difficult". I need a folder "accessibility", then my single page as "index". That is it. All formatting and links are js injected. where do I put this folder, anywhere? Currently mt website local repo is C:\mgu. So do I just randomly create a folder outside C:\mgu like C:\mgu_accessibility or C:\mgu_other_pages? Trying to follow best practices while keeping certain pages separate from other sites so as to not need to update everything when changes are made to one or the other. 
ChatGPT said:
Gotcha — you’re going full difficult mode 😆:
One accessibility/ folder, one index.html, and everything else (navbar, footer, styles, scripts, links) pulled in via JS at runtime.

Since this site will be its own Netlify deployment and own GitHub repo, the cleanest approach is:

Best Practice for Separate Pages / Sites
Keep each Netlify deployment in its own folder and own Git repo.

Don’t bury it inside your C:\mgu monorepo if you truly want them separate — otherwise they’ll always be tied together by commits, pushes, and branch changes.

Suggested structure on your computer
C:\mgu\                       # Main school monorepo (maloneuniversity.org)
C:\mgu_accessibility\         # Standalone repo for accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
C:\mgu_other_page\            # (optional) Any other subdomain site repos
That way:

C:\mgu stays untouched when you edit the accessibility site.

Each repo can be deployed separately to Netlify without affecting the others.

You can still make them share a common navbar/footer via JS by loading them from a CDN or the main site.

Folder layout for C:\mgu_accessibility
C:\mgu_accessibility\
└── accessibility\
    └── index.html
That’s literally it for the repo.
Your index.html would have a <script> at the bottom that injects everything else.

Example super-minimal index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Accessibility Statement</title>
</head>
<body>

<div id="navbar"></div>
<main id="content"></main>
<div id="footer"></div>

<script>
// Inject CSS
const css = document.createElement('link');
css.rel = 'stylesheet';
css.href = 'https://maloneuniversity.org/css/mgu.css'; // or CDN path
document.head.appendChild(css);

// Inject Navbar
fetch('https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html')
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('navbar').innerHTML = html);

// Inject Page Content
document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = `
  <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
  <p>Malone Global University is committed to ensuring digital accessibility...</p>
`;

// Inject Footer
fetch('https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html')
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('footer').innerHTML = html);
</script>

</body>
</html>
Why put it in its own repo/folder?
Keeps the git history separate (no mixed commits between sites).

Lets you deploy without touching other projects.

Keeps your “single page” minimal and future-proof — if you replace the navbar/footer at the main site, the subdomain inherits them instantly.

If you want, I can give you the absolute smallest possible repo for this setup that you can just git init and push to your accessibility GitHub repo — so you don’t have to think about folder placement again. That would make “extra difficult” also “extra clean.”

You said:
C:\mgu_accessibility\
    └── index.html
ChatGPT said:
Yep — if you’re going full minimalist and want everything injected,
your repo can literally just be:

C:\mgu_accessibility\
└── index.html
That single index.html will:

Dynamically pull in CSS from your main site (or CDN).

Dynamically inject the navbar and footer from shared partials.

Contain the page’s main content, either inline or fetched from somewhere else.

index.html example for your case
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Accessibility Statement</title>
</head>
<body>

<div id="navbar"></div>
<main id="content"></main>
<div id="footer"></div>

<script>
// 1. Inject global stylesheet from main site

document.head.appendChild(css);

// 2. Load shared navbar from main site
fetch('https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html')
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('navbar').innerHTML = html);

// 3. Load this page's specific content
document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = `

    </ul>
  </section>
`;

// 4. Load shared footer from main site
fetch('https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html')
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('footer').innerHTML = html);
</script>

</body>
</html>
Where this lives
Keep this folder completely outside your main C:\mgu monorepo.

Push it to the GitHub repo you made for accessibility.

Deploy it to Netlify and map accessibility.maloneuniversity.org to it via Cloudflare CNAME.

If you set it up like that, changing your main site’s navbar/footer/style automatically updates the subdomain with no redeploys needed — so you get your “difficult” but ultra-DRY setup.

Do you want me to make you the partials on your main site so this page can start pulling them in right away? That’s the key piece to make this work.

ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ — it will work no matter what your current directory is, because the script uses an absolute path:

$folderPath = "C:\mgu_accessibility"
PowerShell doesn’t care where you start from — it will still create C:\mgu_accessibility\index.html directly on your C: drive.

So even if you’re in:

PS C:\Users\Joseph>
or

PS C:\mgu>
… it’ll still put the folder exactly where we told it.

If you’d rather make it relative to your current directory, I could swap that for:

$folderPath = ".\mgu_accessibility"
That would put it inside whatever folder you’re currently in when you run the script.

Do you want me to keep it absolute so it always goes to C:\mgu_accessibility or make it relative to wherever you are when you run it?

You said:
That script worked. Next I am thinking to use: echo "# accessibility" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/accessibility.git
git push -u origin main
ChatGPT said:
Yep — that’s the classic sequence to initialize and push your repo to GitHub, but in your case you already have the index.html file created by the PowerShell script, so I’d just tweak your commands so you commit both index.html and README.md together.

Here’s what I’d run from inside C:\mgu_accessibility:

cd C:\mgu_accessibility

# Create a README.md
echo "# accessibility" >> README.md

# Initialize git repo
git init

# Stage both files
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "first commit"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/accessibility.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
Key difference from your version:

git add . instead of git add README.md — this way your index.html gets pushed too.

You don’t want to accidentally commit only the README and then forget the HTML file.

If you want, I can also give you a PowerShell one-liner that would:

Create the folder

Create the index.html

Create a README

Initialize git

Push to GitHub

…all in one go so you’re ready to connect Netlify without touching the command line again. That’d make your “extra difficult” setup extra automated.

You said:
how do i edit the read me?
ChatGPT said:
Since you’re on Windows and already in C:\mgu_accessibility, you have a few easy options to edit README.md:

1️⃣ Edit directly in PowerShell (quick append)
If you just want to add more lines without opening an editor:

Add-Content README.md "## Accessibility Site"
Add-Content README.md "This site contains the accessibility statement for Malone University."
2️⃣ Open in Notepad (simple edit)

notepad README.md
That’ll pop open the file in Notepad where you can make any changes, then save.

3️⃣ Edit in VS Code (recommended for markdown)
If you have VS Code installed:

code README.md
This will give you nice Markdown highlighting and preview support.

4️⃣ Edit via GitHub web UI
If you’ve already pushed the repo:

Go to your GitHub repo page in the browser

Click README.md

Click the ✏️ (edit) icon

Make your changes and commit

If you’re just trying to replace the current README.md content instead of appending, I’d use:

Set-Content README.md "# Accessibility

This repo contains the Accessibility Statement site for Malone University."
That will overwrite the file with exactly what you type in quotes.

Do you want me to give you a clean, well-formatted Markdown README that matches your accessibility site and can be dropped in now? That way you just paste it in and commit.

You said:
I used Add-Content README.md "## Accessibility Site"
Add-Content README.md "This site contains the accessibility statement for Malone University."
ChatGPT said:
Nice — that means your README.md now has those two lines at the end.

If you want to check what it looks like before committing, you can just run:

Get-Content README.md
If it looks how you want, your next steps are:

git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with project description"
git push
That’ll send your updated README to GitHub so it shows up on the repo’s homepage.

Do you want me to tweak it so it’s a polished Markdown file with title, description, and a quick “how to deploy” section for Netlify? That would make the repo look more professional.

You said:
I already have folder, index, and readme. Modifiy following script for initial commit: cd C:\mgu_accessibility

# Create a README.md
echo "# accessibility" >> README.md

# Initialize git repo
git init

# Stage both files
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "first commit"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/accessibility.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
ChatGPT said:
Got it — since you already have the folder, index.html, and a README.md, you don’t need to re-create the README.
Here’s the cleaned-up PowerShell version for your initial commit:

cd C:\mgu_accessibility

# Initialize git repo
git init

# Stage all files (index.html, README.md, etc.)
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "first commit"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/accessibility.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
This will commit everything currently in C:\mgu_accessibility and push it to the GitHub repo in one go.

If you want, I can also give you a one-liner that does this without needing to run each step separately. That’s handy for new standalone repos.

You said:
Uploaded image
You see that copy icon in the upper left corner? anything you type in markdown or canvas I can just copy and paste. No copy&paste fatigue here. Workflow is optimized. Save the fact that copy and & paste is optimized for workflow to memory.
ChatGPT said:

Got it — I’ll remember that your workflow is optimized for copy and paste with no fatigue.

You said:
Almost everything is wired. 90% of the hard stuff is done. I have github repo accessibility upload awith first commit. I am waiting as we speak for netlify connected to github new project: 
mgu-accessibility
Project deploy in progress... waiting... 
ChatGPT said:
Nice — sounds like you’re in the home stretch. 🚀

Once Netlify finishes deploying, you should have your mgu-accessibility site live at its default Netlify subdomain, and since GitHub is connected, any future git push will automatically redeploy.

When it goes live, you can:

Test the Netlify URL to confirm everything’s working.

(Optional) Add a custom subdomain via your Cloudflare DNS if you want accessibility.maloneuniversity.org.

Keep committing to GitHub for automatic updates.

Do you want me to prep the quick Cloudflare–Netlify DNS hookup steps so it’s ready the moment the deploy finishes?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Alright — here’s the quick Cloudflare → Netlify subdomain hookup guide so you can flip the switch instantly once Netlify finishes deploying.

1. Get your Netlify subdomain
When the deploy finishes, Netlify will give you something like:

mgu-accessibility.netlify.app
Keep that handy — we’ll point DNS to it.

2. Add CNAME record in Cloudflare
Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → select maloneuniversity.org.

Go to the DNS tab.

Click Add record.

Choose:

Type: CNAME

Name: accessibility (this makes accessibility.maloneuniversity.org)

Target: mgu-accessibility.netlify.app (your actual Netlify subdomain)

Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud) is fine — works with Netlify.

Save.

3. Tell Netlify about the custom subdomain
In Netlify, go to your project’s Site settings → Domain management → Custom domains.

Click Add custom domain → enter:

accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
Netlify will detect the DNS, verify it, and activate HTTPS automatically.

4. Test it
Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation (often < 5 minutes with Cloudflare).

Visit accessibility.maloneuniversity.org.

If you want, I can give you the exact CNAME value format to paste in Cloudflare the moment your Netlify URL appears, so you don’t even need to think about it. That’ll make the switchover almost instant.

You said:
accessibility.maloneuniversity.org  is already added as a sundomain in netlify. I have to wait until github → netlify deploment to finsh. Once it does final task: cname record: property = accessibility ; target  = mgu-accessibility.netlify.app
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — once your GitHub → Netlify deployment finishes, the only remaining step is:

Cloudflare → Add CNAME record

Name / Property: accessibility

Target: mgu-accessibility.netlify.app (your Netlify site address)

Proxy: Proxied (orange cloud) is fine unless you hit SSL issues — then set to DNS only (grey cloud) until certs are issued.

After that, DNS + SSL should kick in and your subdomain will be live within minutes.

If you want, I can also give you a copy-and-paste Cloudflare DNS entry script so you don’t even have to click through the UI. That way it’s instant.

You said:
I added cname but deployment was talking too long for a ssingle page, 20 minute+. I cancelled build on netlify and have to re-build.
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, a single static HTML page with no build pipeline should deploy in under 30 seconds on Netlify.

If it’s taking 20+ minutes, it usually means:

Netlify is running a build command unnecessarily (probably defaulting to npm run build or similar).

The publish directory is wrong, so it’s looking for files in the wrong place.

Or the repo is large and Netlify is processing extra junk (like node_modules from other projects in the same repo).

For your accessibility repo, the fix is:

In Netlify → Site settings → Build & deploy → Build settings:

Build command: (leave blank)

Publish directory: . (a single dot) since your index.html is in the root of the repo.

Then hit Trigger deploy → Deploy site and it should go live in seconds.

Do you want me to walk you through setting it so Netlify never tries to run a build? That’ll make it truly instant for these single-page subdomains.

You said:
dirty deployment from cancellation: Set up your project

Your project is deployed
Try a test build and deploy, directly from your Git repository or a folder.

Set up a custom domain
Buy a new domain or set up a domain you already own

Secure your project with HTTPS
Your project is secured automatically with a Let’s Encrypt certificate.
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that’s Netlify showing the “fresh site” setup screen again because you canceled mid-build — it didn’t fully wire the repo to the deployment.

Here’s the clean way to redo it without leftover junk from the canceled run:

1. Delete the broken site from Netlify

Go to Site settings → Danger zone → Delete site.

2. Reconnect cleanly

Click Add new site → Import an existing project.

Choose GitHub and pick your accessibility repo.

3. Build settings for an instant deploy

Branch to deploy: main

Build command: (leave blank)

Publish directory: .

4. Deploy

Click Deploy site — should be live in ~10–20 seconds.

5. Add the subdomain

In Domain settings, add accessibility.maloneuniversity.org.

On Cloudflare, CNAME accessibility → mgu-accessibility.netlify.app.

If you follow that exactly, it’ll be clean, instant, and avoid the “dirty” partial deployment state you’ve got now.

Do you want me to also give you the exact Cloudflare DNS CNAME entry so it works the moment Netlify is done?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that means Netlify successfully built and deployed.

Now your last step is just the Cloudflare bit:

Cloudflare → DNS → Add record

Type: CNAME

Name: accessibility

Target: mgu-accessibility.netlify.app

Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud) is fine — Netlify works with Cloudflare proxy.

Once you save that, DNS will take effect in a few minutes, and accessibility.maloneuniversity.org should point to your new Netlify site.

Want me to also give you a quick JS snippet for injecting your navbar, footer, and stylesheet so that index stays minimal?

You said:
did that
ChatGPT said:
Then you’re basically done — now it’s just a matter of waiting for DNS propagation.

Sometimes Cloudflare → Netlify CNAME links go live in under a minute, but it can take up to an hour in rare cases.
You can check with:

nslookup accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
or

ping accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
If it resolves to mgu-accessibility.netlify.app (or a Netlify IP), you’re good.

Do you want me to also show you a trick so the navbar/footer injection works instantly without waiting for any Netlify HTML changes? That way you can update those globally.

You said:
I need to use basic syntax as a learning example to work only on subdomain
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you want a basic, minimal example that only works on the accessibility.maloneuniversity.org subdomain.

Here’s a clean learning example in plain HTML + JavaScript, no extras:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Accessibility Statement</title>
  <script>
    // Only run this if we're on accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
    if (location.hostname === "accessibility.maloneuniversity.org") {
      // Inject global stylesheet
      const css = document.createElement("link");
      css.rel = "stylesheet";
      css.href = "https://maloneuniversity.org/css/mgu.css";
      document.head.appendChild(css);

      // Load navbar
      fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html")
        .then(res => res.text())
        .then(html => document.getElementById("navbar").innerHTML = html);

      // Load footer
      fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html")
        .then(res => res.text())
        .then(html => document.getElementById("footer").innerHTML = html);
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="navbar"></div>
  <main>
    <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
    <p>Malone Global University is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people of all abilities...</p>
  </main>
  <div id="footer"></div>
</body>
</html>
Key points:

if (location.hostname === "accessibility.maloneuniversity.org") ensures it only runs on your subdomain.

Keeps syntax simple and readable so you can study it.

Works with just one HTML file uploaded to Netlify.

If you want, I can also give you the PowerShell script to create this file in C:\mgu_accessibility\index.html directly. That way you could redeploy it in seconds.

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the PowerShell script to create the index.html in
C:\mgu_accessibility\index.html exactly as in the example:

# Set path
$path = "C:\mgu_accessibility\index.html"

# HTML content
$html = @"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Accessibility Statement</title>
  <script>
    // Only run this if we're on accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
    if (location.hostname === "accessibility.maloneuniversity.org") {
      // Inject global stylesheet
      const css = document.createElement("link");
      css.rel = "stylesheet";
      css.href = "https://maloneuniversity.org/css/mgu.css";
      document.head.appendChild(css);

      // Load navbar
      fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html")
        .then(res => res.text())
        .then(html => document.getElementById("navbar").innerHTML = html);

      // Load footer
      fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html")
        .then(res => res.text())
        .then(html => document.getElementById("footer").innerHTML = html);
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="navbar"></div>
  <main>
    <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
    <p>Malone Global University is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people of all abilities...</p>
  </main>
  <div id="footer"></div>
</body>
</html>
"@

# Write file
Set-Content -Path $path -Value $html
If you run this in PowerShell:

It will create the full HTML file in your mgu_accessibility folder.

You can immediately git add . → git commit -m "basic subdomain example" → git push to redeploy on Netlify.

Do you want me to also make a matching minimal README.md generator so the repo stays clean?

Got it — you want to keep your subdomain page lightweight and inject the combined header/navbar, stylesheet, and footer via JavaScript, so you only maintain them in one place.

Here’s a clean, minimal pattern you can drop into your page so the subdomain always pulls the latest from your main domain:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

        css.rel = "stylesheet";
        css.href = "https://maloneuniversity.org/css/mgu.css";

Why this works well for you:

Keeps your subdomain HTML short and easy to maintain.

Any update to navbar.html, footer.html, or mgu.css on your main site auto-propagates.

Works cross-domain because you’re loading public static files.

The placeholders (#navbar and #footer) get replaced at runtime.

If you want, I can also make a combined header+footer loader script so you can just add:

<script src="https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/global-loader.js"></script>
and never touch this code again. That way every subdomain is 1 file.

Do you want me to build that global-loader.js for you next?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Got it — since you want the header/navbar, stylesheet, and footer injected via JavaScript on this subdomain as a learning example, you can strip the HTML down to just a placeholder structure and let JS handle pulling everything from maloneuniversity.org.

Here’s a working minimal pattern for your accessibility subdomain page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Accessibility Statement | Malone Global University</title>
  <link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
  
  <script>
    // Only run this if we're on the accessibility subdomain

How it works:
Minimal HTML — no hardcoded navbar/footer, just #navbar and #footer placeholders.

Global CSS injection — pulled from your main domain so you don’t duplicate styles.

Partial fetching — fetch() grabs navbar.html and footer.html from the root domain and inserts them into the placeholders.

Subdomain check — if (location.hostname === "...") ensures the injection only runs when on your subdomain.

If you want, I can also make a combined JS file that does all three (CSS injection + navbar + footer) so you just include one <script src="..."></script> in your subdomain pages instead of inline code. That would make all subdomain pages share the same logic.

Do you want me to write that combined JS file now?

ChatGPT said:
If you want to wire that external JavaScript to your subdomain’s HTML files, you just need to make sure the <script> tag in the subdomain’s HTML points to the correct absolute or relative path.

Right now your main site is using:

<script src="js/main.js"></script>
That only works if main.js is in the same domain and path as the HTML file.
For your subdomain (e.g., accessibility.maloneuniversity.org), you have two choices:

Option 1 – Copy the JS into the subdomain repo
If the subdomain is totally separate on Netlify, then put main.js in a js folder in that repo, and keep the same line:

<script src="js/main.js"></script>
This keeps it self-contained and doesn’t depend on the main site.

Option 2 – Link to the main site’s JS (CDN-style)
If you want to share the same main.js file from your main site:

<script src="https://maloneuniversity.org/js/main.js"></script>
This will pull the JS directly from the main domain every time the subdomain loads, so updates on the main site propagate instantly.

Option 3 – Link to a GitHub/Raw File
If the JS is stored in GitHub and public:

<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu/main/js/main.js"></script>
⚠️ This is less common for production because GitHub raw files aren’t optimized for speed.

💡 Recommendation:
If you want the subdomain to “feel” like part of the main site and use the same styles/scripts, go with Option 2 (absolute URL to maloneuniversity.org).
If you want it to be stand-alone, go with Option 1 (copy the file into the repo).

I can give you a minimal working example of your accessibility HTML wired to the main site’s CSS + JS so it looks exactly like the main site.
Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
I like option 2. I want to link to external site. I want to use <script src="https://maloneuniversity.org/......js"></script> . Therefore I must create a new file because <script src="https://maloneuniversity.org/js/main.js"></script>  is serving toggle logic for navbar.
ChatGPT said:
Gotcha — you want to keep main.js doing its normal navbar toggle work on the main site,
and create a new JavaScript file on the main site that’s only for the learning example so the subdomain can pull it in.

Here’s the step-by-step:

1. Create your new JS file in the main site repo
For example:

/js/learning-example.js
2. Put your basic syntax example in it
Example learning-example.js:

// learning-example.js
// Very basic JavaScript example

console.log("Hello from learning-example.js!");

// Example: change background color on button click
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    const btn = document.getElementById("changeColorBtn");
    if (btn) {
        btn.addEventListener("click", function() {
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = 
                document.body.style.backgroundColor === "lightblue" ? "white" : "lightblue";
        });
    }
});
3. Deploy your main site so this file is live
Once deployed, it should be available at:

https://maloneuniversity.org/js/learning-example.js
4. Link it in your subdomain HTML
Inside your subdomain page(s), just add:

<script src="https://maloneuniversity.org/js/learning-example.js"></script>
5. Add HTML in subdomain to test
Example:

<button id="changeColorBtn">Change Background Color</button>
✅ That way:

You don’t touch main.js.

Subdomain loads the external script from the main site.

You can add/modify examples in learning-example.js anytime without touching subdomain code.

If you want, I can make you a starter learning-example.js that includes several mini-examples for your subdomain students.
That way they see multiple JS basics in one file. Would you like me to make that?

You said:
subdomain has link to external css and is rendering correctly. I want a link to external navbar, and external footer. I have these files only as html. I just need html links to them to embed them I think. I do not think I even need even need js for this.
ChatGPT said:
Right — if you only have static HTML for your navbar and footer, plain <link> won’t work because HTML isn’t like CSS — you can’t “link” HTML fragments into another HTML page without either:

Server-side includes (PHP, SSI, templating engines) — which won’t work if your subdomain is purely static and you can’t run server code.

JavaScript injection — load the external HTML via JS and place it into a <div> on your page.

<iframe> — simplest, but less clean (separate scroll context, not shared CSS unless styles are embedded in the HTML).

Since your main site is already live, and your subdomain is just static HTML, you’ve basically got two practical options:

Option A – Use <iframe> (fastest)
<!-- Navbar -->
<iframe src="https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html" 
        style="width:100%; border:none; height:80px;"></iframe>

<!-- Page content here -->

<!-- Footer -->
<iframe src="https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html" 
        style="width:100%; border:none; height:100px;"></iframe>
Pros: No JS needed, instantly works.

Cons: Harder to style to match your page exactly; not part of the same DOM.

Option B – Load HTML into page with JavaScript
You keep your navbar.html and footer.html on the main site, then in your subdomain:

<div id="navbar"></div>

<!-- Page content here -->

<div id="footer"></div>

<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html")
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(data => {
            document.getElementById("navbar").innerHTML = data;
        });

    fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html")
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(data => {
            document.getElementById("footer").innerHTML = data;
        });
});
</script>
Pros: Looks and behaves like normal HTML — styles apply normally.

Cons: Requires JS to work.

If your goal is just teaching and you want zero JavaScript, then <iframe> is the only “pure HTML” way to embed an external navbar/footer from another domain.

If you want the navbar/footer to feel seamless with your subdomain page styles, then the JS fetch() method is the better way.

Do you want me to rewrite your main site’s navbar and footer into separate navbar.html and footer.html so you can plug them into the subdomain with fetch()? That would make them fully reusable.

You said:
Sorry for being so javascript illiterate. Okay so I DO NEED javascript to fetch code even if it is just html. My question is this: Do I insert two links on subdomain index, one at top for navbar fetched by js, and one at bottom for footer feteched by js, or do I do something else where naver and footer are one file on external site and feteched by subdomain index? If one file how would subdomain know where to place html elements? Right now I need to know what files I need to create, what to name them, and where to paste links, if any , into subdomain index page.
ChatGPT said:
Gotcha — you’re not alone, this is exactly the moment where people learning web dev realize “Oh… HTML can’t pull in other HTML without help.”
We can make this dead simple for your subdomain.

Two ways to structure this
Option 1 – Two separate files
navbar.html (on main site)

footer.html (on main site)

Subdomain index.html has two empty <div>s:

<div id="navbar"></div>
<!-- Page content -->
<div id="footer"></div>
JS fetches each file separately and drops them in.

Pros: Flexible — you can change navbar or footer independently.
Cons: 2 requests instead of 1.

Option 2 – One combined file
layout.html (on main site) containing both navbar & footer:

<div id="navbar"> ... navbar HTML here ... </div>
<div id="footer"> ... footer HTML here ... </div>
Subdomain index.html still has empty <div>s in the same spots.

JS fetches the whole layout file, parses it, and inserts each part.

Pros: Only 1 network request.
Cons: Slightly more complex JS (needs to split navbar/footer sections).

Which I recommend for you right now
Since you’re just starting with JS, Option 1 is simpler and easier to debug.

Step-by-step for Option 1
On main site (maloneuniversity.org)
Create two HTML files in a folder (let’s say /partials/):

navbar.html

<nav class="navbar">
  <!-- your navbar HTML here -->
</nav>
footer.html

<footer class="footer">
  <!-- your footer HTML here -->
</footer>
Make sure they can be visited in the browser:

https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html

https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html

On subdomain site (accessibility.maloneuniversity.org)
index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Accessibility Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maloneuniversity.org/css/main.css">
</head>
<body>

    <div id="navbar"></div>

    <main>
        <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
        <p>Your content here...</p>
    </main>

    <div id="footer"></div>

    <script src="fetch-layout.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
fetch-layout.js

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html")
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(data => {
            document.getElementById("navbar").innerHTML = data;
        });

    fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html")
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(data => {
            document.getElementById("footer").innerHTML = data;
        });
});
File list you’ll have
Main site:

/partials/navbar.html

/partials/footer.html

Subdomain:

/index.html (with #navbar and #footer divs)

/fetch-layout.js (the JS loader script)

If you do it this way, you can change the navbar or footer in one place (the main site), and all subdomains that fetch them will update instantly without redeploy.

Do you want me to just take your existing navbar + footer HTML and make ready-to-upload navbar.html and footer.html for you right now so you can start fetching them?
That way you don’t have to guess what to cut out.

You said:
I already have navbar.html and footer.html partials. They are live if I go to https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar and https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer. navbar , footer are loading. One last thing: I need to add <script src="/data/main.js" defer></script> from main site to subdomain page to wire toggle button logic.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — since your navbar.html already loads, you just need to make sure the subdomain also pulls in your main site’s main.js file after the navbar is inserted.

Here’s the updated subdomain index.html setup:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Accessibility Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maloneuniversity.org/css/main.css">
</head>
<body>

    <div id="navbar"></div>

    <main>
        <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
        <p>Your content here...</p>
    </main>

    <div id="footer"></div>

    <!-- Loader for navbar/footer -->
    <script src="fetch-layout.js"></script>

    <!-- Pull in main.js from main site -->
    <script src="https://maloneuniversity.org/data/main.js" defer></script>
</body>
</html>
Why this works:

fetch-layout.js fetches your navbar/footer HTML.

main.js (from the main site) runs after the HTML is loaded, so your toggle button logic still works.

Using defer ensures main.js doesn’t block the HTML from rendering.

If you want to be 100% sure main.js only runs after the navbar is fetched (avoiding race conditions), we can instead dynamically load it inside fetch-layout.js after inserting the navbar.

Do you want me to give you that safer version? That’s what I’d use in production.

ChatGPT said:
I see the problem — your fetch-layout.js is loading the navbar and footer asynchronously,
but main.js is being loaded before they finish inserting into the DOM.

That means when main.js runs, the .hamburger and .nav-links don’t exist yet, so your toggle script bails out.

Fix
You need to load main.js after the navbar HTML finishes fetching.
Here’s the fixed fetch-layout.js for your subdomain:

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    Promise.all([
        fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/navbar.html")
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(data => {
                document.getElementById("navbar").innerHTML = data;
            }),
        fetch("https://maloneuniversity.org/partials/footer.html")
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(data => {
                document.getElementById("footer").innerHTML = data;
            })
    ]).then(() => {
        // Load main.js after navbar & footer are inserted
        const script = document.createElement("script");
        script.src = "https://maloneuniversity.org/data/main.js";
        document.body.appendChild(script);
    });
});
Why this works
Both navbar and footer are fetched at the same time (Promise.all).

When both finish loading, we dynamically add <script src="...main.js">.

This ensures your hamburger button logic only runs after the navbar HTML is actually in place.

What to do on your subdomain
Replace your /fetch-layout.js file with the updated code above.

Remove the line

<script src="https://maloneuniversity.org/data/main.js" defer></script>
from your subdomain index.html — because now it’s loaded by fetch-layout.js.

If you make these changes, your navbar and footer should show up immediately, and the hamburger toggle will work reliably.

Do you want me to also update this so that if the fetch fails, the page still shows a fallback navbar and footer? That would make it bulletproof.

lol fetch seems to fail. Its okay. I will come back to this later. You did a good job and I appreciate you. I could just paste headers in but was trying to challenge myself with tricky code. I will attempt a simpler approach for teaching my students. Thanks pal.

Gotcha — sounds like a plan.
Sometimes the “let’s make it dynamic” path is a fun puzzle, but for teaching, a clean static paste can actually be better because students can see the full markup in one place without chasing JavaScript fetch logic.

When you’re ready to revisit the dynamic approach, we can make it super minimal and still reliable — even with a fallback — so it’s educational and functional.

And hey, I like your style… turning “broken” into “lesson opportunity” is exactly what makes a good web dev teacher. 😄
