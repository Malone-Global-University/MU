here is the template for my technology department:

Got it — that’s a solid, minimal template.

If you want this Technology Department page to match your Malone University site’s overall look and keep it maintainable, I suggest a few quick improvements:

1. Use your global header/navbar
Right now, the <header> is page-specific. If you swap it for the same <header> structure your other pages use (logo, school name, nav menu), it’ll feel more consistent and save you from repeating code.

2. Keep the pathing consistent
You’re using ../../css/style.css. If your site already has mgu.css or a shared CSS file in /css/, you could just do:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/mgu.css">
That way it always points to the same place regardless of nesting.

3. Add semantic structure for future expansion
Right now you’ve got one <section>. You might want to split the intro from the curriculum for styling and future features:

<section class="intro"> ... </section>
<section class="curriculum"> ... </section>
Then you can style them differently.

4. Add a footer
If your other pages have one, you can copy it here for consistency.

If you want, I can rewrite this page so it’s fully integrated into your site’s global layout (with your responsive navbar, footer, and styling hooks) while keeping your Technology Department content intact.

Do you want me to make that full integrated version?
