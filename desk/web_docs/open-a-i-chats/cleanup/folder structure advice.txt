What should my folder structure be given: 



1. I have a website folder called "maloneuniversity.org, as a github repo.
2. I have a .github/workflows/deploy.yml with this inside: name: 

Deploy maloneuniversity.org to Cloudflare 

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Wrangler
        run: npm install -g wrangler

      - name: Deploy with Wrangler
        working-directory: maloneuniversity.org
        run: wrangler deploy
        env:
          CF_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}



3. I have a wrangler.toml with this inside: 

{
  "name": "maloneuniversity",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-08-09",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "."
  }
}



4. I have a worker file at cloudflare which I later deployed via cli to git hub.
5. I have cloudflare/worker.js ith this inside:


// Everything-in-one Cloudflare Worker
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Try to fetch via env.ASSETS (Pages / Assets binding) if available,
    // otherwise fetch the origin directly.
    let response;
    try {
      response = env?.ASSETS ? await env.ASSETS.fetch(request) : await fetch(request);
    } catch (err) {
      // Fallback to origin
      response = await fetch(request);
    }

    const contentType = response.headers.get("content-type") || "";
    // Only modify HTML
    if (!contentType.includes("text/html")) {
      return response;
    }

6. I have cloudflare/wrangler.toml with this inside: 


name = "maloneuniversity-worker"
main = "worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2025-08-08"

[vars]
# If you want to pass any environment variables later

[triggers]
routes = ["maloneuniversity.org/*"]


7. That is three folders: "maloneuniversity.org"; ".github"; "cloudflare". What is the recommended file structure?



ChatGPT said:
Given what you’ve got, your setup would be easier to maintain if you treat it as one GitHub repo with three clear areas:

The site source (maloneuniversity.org/) — your HTML, CSS, images, markdown, etc.

The worker (cloudflare/) — your Worker script and its wrangler.toml.

CI/CD automation (.github/workflows/) — your deploy.yml.

Here’s the recommended structure:

/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml              # GitHub Actions workflow
│
├── cloudflare/
│   ├── worker.js                   # Your Cloudflare Worker code
│   └── wrangler.toml               # Worker deployment config
│
├── maloneuniversity.org/
│   ├── index.html                   # Homepage
│   ├── about.html                   # Example page
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── styles.css               # Main CSS
│   ├── images/
│   │   └── logo.png                 # Assets
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── main.js                  # Optional site JS
│   └── ...                          # Any other static files/folders
│
└── wrangler.toml                    # Pages deployment config (root)
Why this works well
Separation of concerns

maloneuniversity.org/ → just your static site.

cloudflare/ → just Worker logic.

.github/ → just CI/CD config.

Two wrangler.toml files for different purposes

Root wrangler.toml → used for deploying the static site to Cloudflare Pages.

cloudflare/wrangler.toml → used for deploying your Worker to Cloudflare Workers.

working-directory in deploy.yml keeps your Pages deploy command looking in maloneuniversity.org/, not in the worker folder.

If you want, I can also show you how to update your deploy.yml so it can deploy both the site and the Worker in one run.
That would mean you can just push to main and both get updated automatically.

You said:
Before you do that I think I need to create a new github account and move these three folders to their own project.
ChatGPT said:
Yeah — that’s actually a good call.
Right now, you’ve got your site, worker, and CI/CD config all tangled in your broader repo history.

If you create a new GitHub repo just for maloneuniversity.org, you get:

Clean commit history (no leftover experiments)

Easier collaboration later

Simpler wrangler deployments (fewer unrelated files to confuse it)

No risk of breaking other projects in your current multi-site repo

Steps to move your three folders into a fresh repo
Create the new GitHub account

Sign out of your current one, create the new one, set up SSH keys if you want.

Create a new empty repo on the new account

Call it maloneuniversity.org (same as your site folder name).

On your local machine

# Go to a safe place to work
cd C:/Projects

# Make a new folder for the new repo
mkdir maloneuniversity.org-clean
cd maloneuniversity.org-clean

# Initialize a fresh Git repo
git init

# Copy the three folders into it
cp -r ../MRELLC-WEBSITES/maloneuniversity.org .
cp -r ../MRELLC-WEBSITES/cloudflare .
cp -r ../MRELLC-WEBSITES/.github .

# Add files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit of site, worker, and workflows"
Link to your new GitHub repo

git remote add origin git@github.com:NEW-USERNAME/maloneuniversity.org.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Reconnect Wrangler to the new repo if needed

Run wrangler login under the new repo directory.

Make sure wrangler.toml points to the right Cloudflare project names.

If you want, I can also give you a “ready to go” cleaned repo version of your three folders, with the file structure and deploy.yml already fixed, so that the moment you push, both the site and worker deploy automatically.
That way you’re not starting from a blank slate.

Do you want me to prep that clean layout?

You said:
 I think EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu will be username/repo at github.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — so the new repo path will be:

github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu
In that case, the clean migration plan looks like this:

1️⃣ Prepare your local project
# Go to a workspace folder (adjust path if needed)
cd C:/Projects

# Make a clean folder for the repo
mkdir mgu
cd mgu

# Initialize empty repo
git init

# Copy over your three folders from the old repo
cp -r ../MRELLC-WEBSITES/maloneuniversity.org .
cp -r ../MRELLC-WEBSITES/cloudflare .
cp -r ../MRELLC-WEBSITES/.github .

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of site, worker, and workflows"
2️⃣ Link it to GitHub
git remote add origin git@github.com:EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
3️⃣ Verify repo on GitHub
Go to https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu

Check that .github/, maloneuniversity.org/, and cloudflare/ are there.

4️⃣ Re-link Wrangler to new repo
In the new local mgu folder:

wrangler login
This ensures Cloudflare knows you’re deploying from the new repo location.

Check wrangler.toml in both root and cloudflare/ so they point to the correct project names.

I can also give you a cleaned-up folder structure for mgu so that when you push to main, your GitHub Action can deploy both the site and the worker in one go, without you running separate commands.

Do you want me to set up that combined deploy flow next?

You said:
when linking to github is said The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.116.3)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
ChatGPT said:
That’s normal — it’s just Git making sure you trust GitHub’s SSH fingerprint before adding it to your known_hosts file.

Here’s what’s happening:

The first time you connect to a host (like github.com) over SSH, your computer doesn’t have its public key stored locally.

SSH shows you the ED25519 key fingerprint so you can verify it matches GitHub’s official fingerprint.

If you type yes, it will save the key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts so you won’t get asked again.

GitHub’s official ED25519 fingerprint is:

SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU
✅ That exactly matches what you saw, so it’s safe to type:

yes
After that, it will remember and you won’t get this message again for GitHub.

Do you want me to also show you how to check your SSH key is actually linked to your GitHub account before you push? That will avoid authentication errors.

You said:

Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
PS C:\projects\mgu>
ChatGPT said:
Yep — that Permission denied (publickey) means your local machine doesn’t have an SSH key registered with your EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC GitHub account.
You authenticated the host just fine, but GitHub rejected the connection because it didn’t recognize your key.

Here’s how to fix it:

1️⃣ Check if you already have an SSH key
In PowerShell:

ls ~/.ssh
If you see something like:

id_ed25519
id_ed25519.pub
or

id_rsa
id_rsa.pub
…then you already have one.
If not, we’ll create one.

2️⃣ Generate a new SSH key (if needed)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Replace your_email@example.com with the email for your new GitHub account.

When asked where to save the key, press Enter to accept the default (C:\Users\<you>\.ssh\id_ed25519).

When asked for a passphrase, you can either set one (more secure) or press Enter (no passphrase).

3️⃣ Add the key to your SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
If you get an error about the agent not running:

Start-Service ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
4️⃣ Copy your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Copy the whole line that starts with ssh-ed25519.

5️⃣ Add the key to GitHub
Go to https://github.com/settings/keys while logged into EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC.

Click New SSH key → Give it a title (like “Main PC”) → Paste the key → Save.

6️⃣ Test the connection
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see:

Hi EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Once that works, you can:

git push -u origin main
If you want, I can also give you a one-shot script that does steps 1–6 for you so you don’t have to type each command manually.
That would get you authenticated in under a minute.

Do you want me to make that?

You said:

The key fingerprint is:
ChatGPT said:
Yes — the email you pass to ssh-keygen is just a label inside the key, it doesn’t have to match your GitHub email for the key to work.

If you want to “change” it:

You don’t have to re-generate the key.

You can just add this key to your GitHub account (EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC) regardless of the email label inside.

Right now, your next steps are:

# Add the key to your SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Show your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Copy the full ssh-ed25519 ... line, then:

Go to https://github.com/settings/keys (while logged in as EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC).

Click New SSH key, paste the key, save.

Do you want me to walk you through testing the SSH connection before you try to push again?
That way we can confirm it’s working before running git push.

PS C:\projects\mgu>
ChatGPT said:
Ah — that error means your OpenSSH Authentication Agent service is disabled on Windows, so ssh-add can’t connect to it.
We just need to enable it first.

Here’s how:

1️⃣ Enable ssh-agent on Windows
Run this in PowerShell as Administrator:

Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service ssh-agent
2️⃣ Add your SSH key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
You should see:

Identity added: /c/Users/Joseph/.ssh/id_ed25519 (maloneuniversity@gmail.com)
3️⃣ Copy your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Copy the entire line and add it to your GitHub account at:
https://github.com/settings/keys → New SSH key.

4️⃣ Test the connection
ssh -T git@github.com
If it’s working, you’ll see:

Hi EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Do you want me to also give you the full single command sequence so you can just paste it into an elevated PowerShell and be ready to push without doing each step manually? That would get you unstuck in one go.

You said:
you can try but I doubt it will work as I already have admin access.
ChatGPT said:
Gotcha — admin access alone won’t start ssh-agent if its startup type is set to Disabled.
That’s why you’re getting the Cannot start service ssh-agent error — Windows refuses to start disabled services until you change the startup type.

We can do it in one shot:

In an elevated PowerShell (Run as Administrator):

# Enable the SSH agent service and start it
Set-Service -Name ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service ssh-agent

# Add your new SSH key
ssh-add "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519"

# Show the public key so you can copy it to GitHub
cat "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub"
After copying your key to GitHub’s New SSH key page, test:

ssh -T git@github.com
You should see:

Hi EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
If that works, git push -u origin main will succeed.

If you want, I can also make it so your GitHub Action deploys both maloneuniversity.org and your Worker in the same push once this is fixed. That way, no manual deploys ever.

You said:
is the .ssh key for authentication or signing in?
ChatGPT said:
Your .ssh key is for authentication, not for “signing in” in the web-browser sense.

Here’s the difference:

Authentication → When you run git push or git pull over SSH, GitHub needs to know it’s really you.

Your private key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519) stays on your machine.

Your public key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) is stored in your GitHub account.

SSH proves you own the private key without sending it over the network.

Signing in → That’s when you log into GitHub’s website with a username/password or passkey — completely separate from SSH keys.

Extra note: SSH keys can also be used for commit signing if you configure them that way, but that’s optional and uses a different setup.
Right now, your SSH key is only being used so git@github.com will accept pushes from your machine without asking for your username/password each time.

If you want, I can show you how the SSH handshake works step-by-step so you know exactly why GitHub rejects a push when the key isn’t set up. That would make the whole process less mysterious.

ChatGPT said:
That “Permission denied (publickey)” means the SSH handshake is still failing because GitHub doesn’t recognize your public key — most likely because you haven’t added it to your EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC account yet.

Right now the flow is:

You generated a key ✅

You added it to the SSH agent ✅

You need to tell GitHub about it ❌ (this is the missing step)

How to fix:
Copy your public key again

cat "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub"
You should see something like:

ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... maloneuniversity@gmail.com
Add it to your GitHub account

Sign in to https://github.com as EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC

Go to Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

Give it a title (e.g., "Main PC")

Paste the entire ssh-ed25519 ... line

Save

Test again

ssh -T git@github.com
Expected success message:

Hi EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
If you’ve already added it but still get Permission denied, then either:

The key was added to the wrong GitHub account (e.g., your personal one, not EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC)

Or Git is still using HTTPS instead of SSH for that remote

I can check that second possibility by having you run:

git remote -v
Do you want me to walk you through switching your remote from HTTPS to SSH if that’s the problem? That’s the other common cause here.

You said:
I added it. After saving it shows a different key?
ChatGPT said:
Yep — that’s actually normal.

When you paste your SSH public key into GitHub and save it, GitHub doesn’t display the full thing back to you — it shortens and formats it:

You uploaded something like:

ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJbcdE... maloneuniversity@gmail.com
GitHub shows only the fingerprint (a short hex string) or a shortened key preview for security/convenience.

It’s still your same key — they just don’t store/display it in the exact same way you pasted it.

At this point, you should try:

ssh -T git@github.com
If it still says Permission denied (publickey), then the likely culprit is that your repo is using HTTPS instead of SSH.
We can confirm with:

git remote -v
Do you want me to check and, if needed, switch your mgu repo remote to SSH so it actually uses your key? That’s the step most people miss after adding the key.

You said:
PS C:\projects\mgu> git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.git (push)
PS C:\projects\mgu>
ChatGPT said:
Okay, so your remote is already using SSH — that’s good.
That means the connection issue is likely either:

Wrong key loaded in the agent (GitHub isn’t recognizing the one you added)

Multiple SSH keys on your system and Git is trying the wrong one

SSH config missing a GitHub entry

Here’s the quickest fix path:

1️⃣ Check which key is being offered

ssh -vT git@github.com
The -v (verbose) flag will show which keys are tried and which one GitHub rejects.
Look for a line like:

Offering public key: C:/Users/Joseph/.ssh/id_ed25519
If it says something else, that’s your problem.

2️⃣ Force GitHub to use this key
Create or edit this file:

notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config
Add:

Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    IdentitiesOnly yes
Save it.

3️⃣ Restart the agent & reload your key

ssh-add -D
ssh-add "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519"
4️⃣ Test again

ssh -T git@github.com
If it works, you’ll get:

Hi EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC! You've successfully authenticated...
If you want, I can walk you through reading the ssh -vT output so we know exactly why GitHub is refusing it instead of guessing. That will pinpoint the cause immediately.

You said:
I am in
ChatGPT said:
Nice 🎉
That means your SSH key is now properly linked to GitHub, and git push / git pull will work without asking for credentials.

Now that you’re connected, we can move your three folders into the new mgu repo and push them in one clean commit so GitHub becomes your source of truth.

Do you want me to set up that folder move and first commit for you step-by-step?

ChatGPT said:
Yep — that last line

Hi EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
means your SSH key is now fully working with GitHub.

The reason you saw “different keys” in the debug output is because GitHub’s server presents multiple host keys (RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519) for security. Those aren’t your keys — they’re GitHub’s host keys, which your computer stores in known_hosts so it can verify you’re talking to the real GitHub in future connections.

Your key (the Ed25519 one tied to maloneuniversity@gmail.com) is still the one used for authentication.

If you want, we can now:

Create the mgu repo locally (if not already done)

Move your three folders into it

Make the first commit and push it to git@github.com:EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.git

Do you want me to give you the exact PowerShell commands for that push?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Alright — since you already have your mgu folder and the GitHub remote set up, here’s the clean PowerShell sequence to commit and push everything to your repo for the first time:

# 1. Go to your mgu project folder
cd C:\projects\mgu

# 2. Check if Git already knows this is a repo
git status

# If it says "fatal: not a git repository", then initialize it:
git init

# 3. Link it to your GitHub remote (you already have this, but just in case)
git remote add origin git@github.com:EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.git

# 4. Stage all your files
git add .

# 5. Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit of mgu project"

# 6. Push to GitHub main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
After that, you can verify it’s live on GitHub by visiting:
https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu

If you want, I can also show you how to make future pushes in just two commands instead of this whole sequence. That’ll make life much easier when you update the site.

Do you want me to give you that quick push workflow?

You said:
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that means your local copy is already fully committed.

Now you just need to push it up to GitHub so it’s actually on the website:

git push -u origin main
After that, your mgu repo on GitHub will match your local folder.

Want me to also check that your Cloudflare Worker auto-deploy is triggered right after this push? That way your site updates immediately.

Nice — that push worked perfectly. 🚀

Your mgu repo on GitHub now has your full project.

Next steps if you want everything connected:

Check GitHub — confirm the files are there at https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.

Link to Cloudflare Worker/Pages — so each git push automatically deploys.

Test deploy — push a small change to make sure it updates online.

Do you want me to walk you through step 2 so your new repo deploys automatically?

You said:
okay
ChatGPT said:
Alright — since you’re using Cloudflare Pages (or a Worker that’s triggered by GitHub pushes), here’s how to hook your mgu repo up so each push deploys automatically.

1️⃣ Link the GitHub repo to Cloudflare
Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages.

Click "Create a project" (or "Connect to Git" if you already have Pages set up).

Choose GitHub as the source.

Authorize Cloudflare to access your repos (if not already done).

Select EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu.

2️⃣ Configure the build settings
Production branch: main

Framework preset: None (since your site is static HTML/CSS, unless you’re using a build tool)

Build command: leave blank for pure HTML, or npm run build if using a bundler.

Build output directory: / (root)

3️⃣ Add environment variables (if needed)
If your build or deployment needs environment vars (API keys, etc.), add them here.

4️⃣ Deploy
Click "Save and Deploy".
From now on, every time you do:

git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push
Cloudflare will auto-build and deploy your changes.

Since you already had a Cloudflare Worker workflow YAML earlier, we could also make GitHub Actions deploy via wrangler instead of Pages if you prefer serverless control.

Do you want me to set this up as Pages (easier) or keep using your wrangler workflow?

You said:

Got it — so basically, you cloned the exact old repo (from alpha-group-mrellc) into your new GitHub account (epsilon-group-mrellc/mgu), and now you want the Cloudflare deploy automation that was wired to the old repo to work with the new repo.

Right now, Cloudflare is still listening to the old repo, so the new one won’t auto-deploy until you update the integration.

Here’s what you need to do:

1️⃣ In Cloudflare dashboard
Log in to Cloudflare.

Go to the site’s settings (your maloneuniversity.org project).

If you were using Cloudflare Pages:

Go to Pages → Your project → Settings → Git Integration.

Disconnect the old alpha-group-mrellc repo.

Reconnect using your new GitHub account.

Select mgu as the repo.

If you were using Wrangler GitHub Actions:

Skip to step 2 below.

2️⃣ If using GitHub Actions (Wrangler deploy)
Since your repo has .github/workflows/deploy.yml, it’s probably using GitHub Actions to run wrangler deploy.

In that case, you need to:

Go to your new GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

Re-add your CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN and CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (these are not copied over when you make a new repo — they must be re-added manually).

The workflow file .github/workflows/deploy.yml should now run automatically on each push to main.

3️⃣ Test it
Make a small change in your site (e.g., edit some HTML text).

Run:

git add .
git commit -m "Test deploy"
git push
Check GitHub Actions tab → See if your deploy workflow runs.

If it succeeds, check the live site.

From your description, my guess is your deployment is GitHub Actions + Wrangler (not Pages), so the only real blocker is re-adding your Cloudflare API token & account ID to the new repo’s secrets.

If you want, I can rewrite your .github/workflows/deploy.yml so it’s ready to work with the new repo right now.
Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Alright — here’s a clean, working .github/workflows/deploy.yml for your new repo so it deploys to Cloudflare via Wrangler every time you push to main:

name: Deploy maloneuniversity.org to Cloudflare

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Wrangler
        run: npm install -g wrangler

      - name: Deploy to Cloudflare
        run: wrangler deploy
        env:
          CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
Setup steps for your new repo
In your new GitHub repo:

Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.

Add:

CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID → your account ID from Cloudflare.

CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN → your API token with “Edit Workers” permission.

Save the workflow file as:

.github/workflows/deploy.yml
Commit & push:

git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Setup Cloudflare deploy workflow"
git push
On your next push to main, GitHub Actions will:

Pull the repo

Install Wrangler

Deploy to Cloudflare using your new repo’s secrets.

If you give me your old deploy.yml, I can also merge any extra settings you had so nothing breaks.
Do you want me to keep it exactly like before but with the new repo connection?

it is hard to find where cloudflare buries api token page. I need API token
Name:Workers Builds - 2025-08-09 02:36
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you're looking for your Cloudflare API token (specifically the one named “Workers Builds - 2025-08-09 02:36”) but can't remember where Cloudflare hides it. Here's exactly where to look and what to do:

How to find (or roll) your API token
Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard.

Click your user profile icon in the top right, and select My Profile.

In the left-hand menu (or on the profile page), click API Tokens. This will show a list of all existing tokens — including the one you're referring to.
Cloudflare Docs
Cloudflare Community

Near the “Workers Builds - 2025-08-09 02:36” entry, click the three-dots menu, then select Roll if you suspect the token might be expired or lost.
Cloudflare Docs

This generates a new token, invalidating the previous one.

Important: Cloudflare displays the token only once. Make sure to copy and save it immediately.

Quick steps summary
Step	Action
1⃣	Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Click your profile → My Profile
2⃣	Navigate to API Tokens
3⃣	Find “Workers Builds - 2025-08-09 02:36” → click ⋮ (more) → Roll
4⃣	Copy the new token as soon as it appears — this will be your CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN for GitHub Actions.
Once you have the new token, go to your GitHub repository (under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) and add or replace the CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN in the repo secrets. That will ensure your deploy workflow has proper access again.

Let me know when you have the token copied, and we’ll get your workflow fully reauthorized.

You said:
done
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — now that you’ve rolled and copied the Cloudflare API token, the next step is to make sure GitHub Actions is using it for your new repo (EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/mgu).

Here’s what to do:

1. Add the token to your GitHub repo secrets
Go to your repo on GitHub → Settings tab.

In the left menu, click Secrets and variables → Actions.

Click New repository secret.

Name it exactly:

CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
Paste in your token from Cloudflare.

Click Add secret.

2. Update your workflow (if needed)
In .github/workflows/deploy.yml, make sure you’re referencing that secret like this:

env:
  CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
…and that Wrangler is using it:

- name: Publish to Cloudflare Workers
  run: wrangler deploy
  env:
    CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
3. Test the deployment
Push any small change to main in your local repo:

git add .
git commit -m "Test deployment after token update"
git push origin main
Then check Actions in GitHub to see if your deploy workflow runs successfully.

Do you want me to also make sure your deploy.yml is already pointing to the new mgu repo instead of the old one? That’s a common place where old account references hide.

You said:
I think I am good. I pushed and github says it is in progress. I deleted a folder of old html that I do not need anymore. My depoly code on github is pointing correctly: 
name: Deploy maloneuniversity.org to Cloudflare

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # change if your default branch is not "main"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Wrangler
        run: npm install -g wrangler

      - name: Deploy with Wrangler
        working-directory: maloneuniversity.org
        run: wrangler deploy
        env:
          CF_API_TOKEN: ${{  secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
ChatGPT said:
Nice — that looks clean.

One small but important thing: in your workflow you’re setting

CF_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
…but Wrangler expects the variable name to be CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, not CF_API_TOKEN.

So you’d want:

env:
  CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
Otherwise, Wrangler won’t pick up the token, and the deploy could fail with “No API token found” even though you set it in GitHub.

Do you want me to rewrite your deploy.yml so it’s 100% correct for your new repo and token? That would make sure the next push is bulletproof.

I fixed it. github says CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN

Perfect — then your deploy pipeline should be fine now.

Since you already saw GitHub say “in progress,” the next check is whether Cloudflare’s logs show the new build and the site updates reflect your HTML folder deletion. If everything’s wired right, your next push should automatically trigger Wrangler and update maloneuniversity.org without you running anything locally.

Do you want me to walk you through verifying that the deploy actually went through on Cloudflare’s side? That’s the last sanity check.

oops. I meant github says deploy
succeeded 8 minutes ago in 17s

Nice — that means your new GitHub account, repo, and Cloudflare wiring are officially talking to each other. 🎉

At this point, if you refresh maloneuniversity.org and clear your browser cache (or use an incognito window), you should see the updated version without the deleted HTML folder’s pages.

If you still see the old content, that would just mean Cloudflare is serving cached files, which we can purge.

You said:
it was a subfolder of earlier copies of static pages. There were no links to that subfolder.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — so in that case, removing that old subfolder is purely a cleanup win and won’t change anything the public can actually click to.

That’s the best kind of deployment: no broken links, no panic, just less clutter in your repo. 🚀
