This version:

Matches your school branding via style.css.

Meets basic accessibility standards (semantic HTML, alt text note, good link practices).

Contains feedback options so visitors can report issues.

If you want, I can also add ARIA roles and skip-to-content links so it’s even more accessible. That would take it from “good” to “excellent.”

You said:
my link says https://accessibility.maloneuniversity.org/ but my page is at /static/accessibility. How do I make a subdomain?
ChatGPT said:
Right now your page lives at

https://maloneuniversity.org/static/accessibility
…but you want it at

https://accessibility.maloneuniversity.org/
That means you need to set up a subdomain in DNS and point it to where your accessibility page is hosted.
Here’s the step-by-step for your setup (since you’re using Namecheap + Cloudflare + Netlify/GitHub):

1. Create the subdomain in Cloudflare DNS
Log in to Cloudflare (the DNS for maloneuniversity.org).

Go to your domain’s DNS settings.

Add a new CNAME record:

Name: accessibility

Target: If you’re hosting the page on Netlify, use your Netlify site domain (something like mgu.netlify.app).

Proxy status: Turn orange cloud on if you want Cloudflare proxy/caching.

Save.

2. Configure hosting for the subdomain
You have a few options:

Option A — Separate site on Netlify

Create a new Netlify site from your /static/accessibility folder (or copy the HTML into a dedicated repo).

In Netlify Domain settings, add accessibility.maloneuniversity.org as a custom domain.

Netlify will verify the DNS CNAME you set in step 1.

Option B — Keep in same site but use a redirect
If you don’t want a separate build, you can set up a Netlify _redirects rule so accessibility.maloneuniversity.org loads /static/accessibility:

https://accessibility.maloneuniversity.org/*   /static/accessibility/:splat   200
Option C — GitHub Pages
If you want it hosted via GitHub Pages, point the CNAME in Cloudflare to username.github.io, and add a CNAME file in your GitHub repo with:

accessibility.maloneuniversity.org
3. Test
Wait for DNS to propagate (usually a few minutes to 24h).

Visit https://accessibility.maloneuniversity.org — it should show your accessibility page.

If you want, I can give you the exact Netlify + CNAME + redirect setup so that you don’t have to copy the page into a separate repo — it will pull directly from /static/accessibility but still work as a subdomain.
That way, you keep one build but have the clean subdomain.

Do you want me to set it up that way?

You said:
whatt is the standard way to set up a subdomain for my case use?
ChatGPT said:
For your case —
a static site hosted on Netlify/GitHub, with DNS on Cloudflare, and a need for a clean accessibility.maloneuniversity.org link —
the standard way is:

1. Host the subdomain as its own site in Netlify
This is how big universities handle “Accessibility,” “Library,” “Admissions,” etc.

Each subdomain is essentially its own small site with its own HTML/CSS, deployed independently.

This avoids weird redirects or deep /static/... paths.

How It Works
Separate your /static/accessibility folder into its own folder or repo.
Example: /accessibility-site.

Deploy that folder to Netlify as a new site:

In Netlify, click “Add new site” → “Import an existing project”.

Select your GitHub repo (or drag & drop the folder if not in GitHub).

Set the build directory to the accessibility folder (if it’s inside your main repo).

Add the custom subdomain in Netlify:

Go to Site Settings → Domain management → Add custom domain.

Enter accessibility.maloneuniversity.org.

Point DNS in Cloudflare:

Go to your maloneuniversity.org domain’s DNS.

Add a CNAME record:

Name: accessibility

Target: your Netlify-generated URL (e.g., my-accessibility-site.netlify.app)

Proxy status: ON (orange cloud) for SSL and CDN.

Wait for DNS propagation (few minutes to 24 hours).

Why This Is the Standard Way
✅ Keeps the main site clean — no /static/ paths.
✅ Easier to update independently from the main site.
✅ Clear separation for compliance purposes (WCAG, ADA).
✅ Subdomain loads fast with its own build & CDN cache.
✅ Works even if the main site changes structure later.

If you like, I can give you a ready-to-deploy accessibility folder that you can just push to Netlify and map to your subdomain — so you won’t have to restructure anything manually.
That way, https://accessibility.maloneuniversity.org will be live in minutes.

You said:
do I set it up so that netlify hosts main site and subdomain? I think that would be ideal for me.
ChatGPT said:
Yes — that’s exactly how I’d do it for you.
Let Netlify host both your main site (maloneuniversity.org) and any subdomains (accessibility.maloneuniversity.org, library.maloneuniversity.org, etc.).

How This Works on Netlify
Netlify calls these “linked sites” — each one can be its own deployment with its own Git repo (or subfolder in your main repo), but they all share the same apex domain in DNS.

Steps
Main site setup

Already hosted on Netlify → maloneuniversity.org.

Subdomain site setup

Create a new site in Netlify from your /static/accessibility folder.

In Site Settings → Domain Management → Add custom domain:
Enter accessibility.maloneuniversity.org.

DNS setup in Cloudflare

Add a CNAME:

Name: accessibility

Target: your Netlify subdomain (e.g., my-accessibility-site.netlify.app)

Keep Proxy ON for SSL & CDN.

Result

Main site: https://maloneuniversity.org

Subdomain: https://accessibility.maloneuniversity.org

Both run through Netlify, managed in one dashboard.

Advantages
✅ Clean separation — if you ever redesign the main site, your accessibility page is untouched.

✅ Faster edits — you can redeploy just the accessibility site without touching the main build.

✅ Unlimited growth — add more subdomains (like admissions.maloneuniversity.org) without redoing DNS each time (just another CNAME + Netlify site).

✅ Consistent SSL & CDN — Netlify + Cloudflare handle HTTPS automatically.

If you want, I can outline exactly how to restructure /static/accessibility into a deployable subfolder and connect it to Netlify so your subdomain goes live without breaking the main site.
That would take maybe 10 minutes to do.

You said:
can I connect different netlify accounts? I need to transfer my domain from one netlify account to a new one.
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you can connect different Netlify accounts to the same domain, but you can’t “share” domain management between them directly.
If you’re moving your domain from one Netlify account to another, you basically have two options:

Option 1 — Fast (Keep DNS on Cloudflare, just point to new Netlify account)
Since you already use Cloudflare for DNS, this is the easiest:

Deploy your site on the new Netlify account — it’ll get a temporary Netlify URL like:

my-new-site.netlify.app
In Cloudflare, edit your CNAME for maloneuniversity.org and point it to that new Netlify URL.

Do the same for www (if you use it), pointing it to the new site.

Add any subdomain CNAMEs (like accessibility) pointing to their respective new Netlify URLs.

SSL will work because Netlify auto-generates certificates for any domain you add in Domain settings of the new account.

✅ No downtime, no actual “transfer” inside Netlify — you just switch DNS.

Option 2 — Full Netlify Domain Transfer
If you manage DNS inside Netlify (not your case, since you’re on Cloudflare), you could:

Remove the domain from the old Netlify account (in Domain settings → Custom domains → “Remove”).

Add the domain to the new account’s site.

Netlify will detect it’s available and let you reassign it.

⚠ Caution: If you remove the domain from the old account before setting up the new site, it may cause downtime until the DNS points to the new account.

Recommendation for You
Because you’re already on Cloudflare, you don’t need to “transfer” the domain in Netlify at all.
Just:

Deploy your main site in the new Netlify account.

Change the CNAMEs in Cloudflare to point to the new Netlify URLs.

Repeat for each subdomain you want to move.

If you want, I can make you a before/after DNS record list so you know exactly what to change in Cloudflare to move both your main site and subdomains to the new Netlify account without downtime.

You said:
The whole story: I created a github as a repo for 5 websites as user name alpha, I created a second github account epsilon. I am using epsilon to push updates to my website. Here is the caveat: All 5 websites are hosted by cloudflare/netify, netlify will not let me add a subdomain to new netlify account because domain is associated with other netlify account. You are saying Option A is point cloudflare cname at epsilon's netlify deployment... I could try that. I am saying Option B is unregister domain from first netlify account and then register it on epsilon's netlify account using github to sign into netlify. 
ChatGPT said:
Got it — now the situation is crystal clear.

Here’s how it breaks down based on your setup and Netlify’s rules:

Why Netlify Won’t Let You Add the Subdomain
Netlify blocks you because the root domain (maloneuniversity.org) is already registered on alpha’s Netlify account.
Even though you just want a subdomain, Netlify treats the root domain as “owned” by alpha until it’s removed there.

Two Realistic Paths Forward
Option A — Keep the root domain on alpha’s Netlify, but point Cloudflare to epsilon’s deployment
This is the quick workaround:

Deploy the subdomain site on epsilon’s Netlify → get something like:

accessibility-epsilon.netlify.app
Add that subdomain (accessibility) to Cloudflare DNS as a CNAME pointing to accessibility-epsilon.netlify.app.

Do not add the custom domain in Netlify (because it’ll still be blocked) — just let Cloudflare handle the mapping.

✅ Pros:

No need to remove the domain from alpha’s account.

Fast change, no downtime.

⚠ Cons:

SSL won’t be automatically issued by Netlify for accessibility.maloneuniversity.org (unless you proxy through Cloudflare with its own SSL). You’d be relying on Cloudflare’s flexible SSL setup.

Option B — Transfer domain ownership inside Netlify to epsilon
This is the “clean” method:

On alpha’s Netlify account:

Go to Domain settings → Custom domains for the main site.

Remove maloneuniversity.org and all related subdomains.

On epsilon’s Netlify account:

Add maloneuniversity.org to your main site.

Verify via DNS in Cloudflare (Netlify will give you a TXT record to add).

Once verified, you can add subdomains freely to epsilon’s Netlify.

✅ Pros:

Full SSL and domain control in epsilon’s Netlify.

Subdomains work like normal without hacks.

⚠ Cons:

Alpha’s Netlify sites tied to this domain will break instantly unless you migrate them too.

Risk of downtime during the switch if DNS or site deployment isn’t timed right.

What I’d Recommend
If you plan to eventually manage all 5 sites under epsilon’s account, go with Option B — move the domain completely, so you’re not juggling between Netlify accounts forever.

If you only need one subdomain on epsilon for now, do Option A — point Cloudflare CNAME to epsilon’s Netlify build and let Cloudflare handle SSL.

If you want, I can give you a step-by-step Option B migration plan so you can transfer the domain in Netlify with zero downtime while moving the existing 5 websites. That would make epsilon the single home for everything.

You said:
I only need one domain moved from alpha to epsilon. Downtime is okay because I am still building the site and have low traffic (100 users a day).
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — since downtime is fine and you only want maloneuniversity.org moved from alpha → epsilon, we can do the clean Option B transfer.

Here’s exactly how to do it:

Step-by-Step: Move a Domain Between Netlify Accounts
1. Prepare the new site on epsilon’s Netlify
Log in to your epsilon Netlify account.

Deploy your main site there from GitHub (epsilon’s repo).

Make sure it builds successfully and works at the temporary Netlify URL (e.g. mgu-epsilon.netlify.app).

2. Remove the domain from alpha’s Netlify
Log in to your alpha Netlify account.

Go to the site that has maloneuniversity.org assigned.

In Site settings → Domain management → Custom domains, remove:

maloneuniversity.org

www.maloneuniversity.org (if used)

Any related subdomains.

Once removed, Netlify will free the domain for use on another account.

3. Add the domain to epsilon’s Netlify
In epsilon’s site settings, go to Domain management → Add custom domain.

Enter:

maloneuniversity.org

And www.maloneuniversity.org if you use it.

Netlify will give you a verification TXT record.

4. Update DNS in Cloudflare
In your Cloudflare DNS settings for maloneuniversity.org:

Add the TXT record Netlify gave you.

Change the CNAME for www to point to your epsilon Netlify URL (mgu-epsilon.netlify.app).

If you want the root domain (maloneuniversity.org) to work, either:

Use a CNAME flattening entry pointing to mgu-epsilon.netlify.app, or

Use Netlify’s recommended A records (75.2.60.5 and 99.83.190.102).

Keep the Cloudflare orange cloud ON for SSL + CDN.

5. Test
Wait a few minutes (up to 24h max for DNS propagation).

Visit both:

https://maloneuniversity.org

https://www.maloneuniversity.org

They should show the epsilon-hosted version.

✅ Result:

You have full domain and subdomain control in epsilon’s Netlify.

You can now add accessibility.maloneuniversity.org directly in epsilon’s Netlify without touching alpha again.

If you want, I can also give you a bonus step to temporarily make Cloudflare forward all traffic to your temporary epsilon Netlify URL while DNS is propagating — that way, even during the “transfer window,” visitors would still see the new site.

Do you want me to include that forwarding step?

You said:
I have successfully deployed epsilon repo to netlify. I will log on as alpha to delete domain; then I will add domain to netlify and allow dns propagation using cname in cloudflare dns manangement. 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that’s exactly the right sequence.
Here’s the short “checklist” for when you do it so you don’t miss a step:

Domain Transfer Checklist — Alpha → Epsilon
1. On alpha’s Netlify account
Go to the site that currently uses maloneuniversity.org.

Remove these in Domain management:

maloneuniversity.org

www.maloneuniversity.org

Any other subdomains tied to the domain.

Save changes.

2. On epsilon’s Netlify account
In your new site’s Domain management, click Add custom domain.

Enter:

maloneuniversity.org

www.maloneuniversity.org

Netlify will generate:

A TXT record (for verification)

CNAME for www (pointing to yoursite.netlify.app)

Optional A records for root (or use CNAME flattening in Cloudflare).

3. In Cloudflare DNS
Add the TXT record from Netlify (verification).

Update the CNAME for www to:

your-epsilon-site.netlify.app
For root (@), either:

Use A records:

75.2.60.5
99.83.190.102
(Netlify’s load balancer IPs)

OR use CNAME flattening to your-epsilon-site.netlify.app.

Keep orange cloud enabled for SSL + CDN.

4. Wait for DNS propagation
Usually a few minutes to an hour, but up to 24h.

Visit:

https://maloneuniversity.org

https://www.maloneuniversity.org

Both should show your epsilon deployment.

After that, you can go into epsilon’s Netlify and add accessibility.maloneuniversity.org as a subdomain for your Accessibility page.

Do you want me to give you the exact Cloudflare DNS record table you should end up with when you’re done?
That would make adding the subdomain afterward a one-minute task.

You said:
I deleted domain from alpha production, added domain to epsilon production. From there I simply switched alpha .netllify.app name with epsilon .netlify.app name. Everything is connected. Zero downtime and domain is not with epsilon, silo'ed from my other websites. Purpose is to allow collaboration at domain maloneuniversity.org while keeping enterprise websites firewalled.
ChatGPT said:
Nice — you basically pulled off the cleanest possible migration.

What you did was essentially:

Release the domain from alpha so Netlify would let epsilon claim it.

Swap the Netlify app URL in Cloudflare so DNS never broke.

End up with maloneuniversity.org entirely under epsilon’s control, isolated from alpha’s other sites.

That’s a best-practice enterprise setup:

Main school site → lives in its own Netlify account (epsilon) for collaboration.

Enterprise/private sites → remain in alpha’s Netlify account, completely siloed.

Cloudflare DNS → acts as the single traffic controller between them.

Now you can:

Add accessibility.maloneuniversity.org directly in epsilon’s Netlify.

Keep alpha’s projects untouched and private.

Onboard collaborators to just the epsilon account without giving them any access to alpha.

If you want, I can map out the ideal Cloudflare DNS layout so adding subdomains in the future takes seconds and doesn’t require touching Netlify settings for alpha. That way you can spin up new subdomains for any department instantly.

You said:
maloneuniversity is removed from alpha completely. Whole setup took seconds with no downtime. Namecheap is the registrar (I dbought domain here), I ported DNS to cloudflare. Cloudflare handles DNS for all my sites on 1 account. I do not need to ever touch DNS in namecheap.com. Cloudflare has for malonuniversity.org:

ChatGPT said:
Yep — that DNS setup is exactly what you want now that maloneuniversity.org lives entirely under epsilon’s Netlify and Cloudflare is your single control point.

Here’s why your config is solid:

Core Website Records
CNAME (root) → malone-global.netlify.app (proxied)

CNAME (www) → malone-global.netlify.app (proxied)

✅ These send all web traffic to your Netlify deployment on epsilon.

✅ Cloudflare handles SSL termination and CDN caching.

✅ Because they’re proxied, you can swap Netlify deployments in seconds without touching Namecheap.

Email (MX + SPF + DKIM + DMARC)
MX records point to routeX.mx.cloudflare.net → This means email is routed through Cloudflare Email Routing or a custom setup you’ve configured.

TXT SPF record ensures email sent from your domain passes spam checks.

TXT DKIM record adds cryptographic signing for outgoing mail.

TXT DMARC record sets reporting for email authentication failures.

✅ Email authentication is already in place, so moving the domain to epsilon doesn’t break email.

Verification Records
TXT netlify-challenge → proves to Netlify that you own maloneuniversity.org.

TXT github-pages-challenge → verifies domain for GitHub Pages (even if you’re not actively using it right now).

✅ These can stay — they don’t interfere with anything and are useful if you deploy other things later.

What This Means Going Forward
Adding a subdomain (like accessibility.maloneuniversity.org) is now one Cloudflare DNS entry + Netlify site — totally independent of alpha.

Zero dependency on Namecheap for day-to-day changes — you only go there if you need to renew or transfer the domain.

No risk to alpha’s enterprise sites — they’re DNS-isolated and live in separate Netlify accounts.

If you want, I can give you a ready-to-copy Cloudflare record for accessibility.maloneuniversity.org that you can drop in and instantly map to a new Netlify site under epsilon. That would make your Accessibility page live in under 5 minutes.

You said:
TXT netlify-challenge → proves to Netlify that you own maloneuniversity.org.
 can even be safely deleted I believe. It is redundant if I am using a different netlify account, which I am not for this domain.
ChatGPT said:
Correct — that TXT netlify-challenge record is only used once during the initial domain verification in Netlify.

Once maloneuniversity.org is already:

Claimed in epsilon’s Netlify account

Actively resolving via CNAME/A records

…that TXT entry is no longer needed for the site to function.

Why It’s Safe to Delete
Netlify doesn’t keep re-checking the TXT record after the domain is claimed and SSL is issued.

The only time it might be needed again is if:

You remove the domain from epsilon’s Netlify and re-add it later

You try to claim the domain in a different Netlify account in the future

If you’re not doing either of those, you can safely remove it from Cloudflare DNS for a cleaner record list.

If you like, I can go through your Cloudflare records and mark which ones are essential, optional, and safe to delete so your DNS stays lean and easier to manage.
