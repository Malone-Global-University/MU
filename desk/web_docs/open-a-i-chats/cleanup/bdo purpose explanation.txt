what is the purpose of BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

ChatGPT said:
BDO, or Bi-Directional Override, is an HTML element (<bdo>) whose purpose is to force the text direction to display in a specific way, regardless of the normal direction rules for that language.

It’s mainly used for languages with right-to-left (RTL) scripts—like Arabic or Hebrew—when you need to override the default left-to-right (LTR) flow, or vice versa.

Example:

<p>Normal: English text</p>
<p><bdo dir="rtl">English text</bdo></p>
What happens here:

Normally, English flows LTR.

With <bdo dir="rtl">, the browser forces the characters to appear in reverse order visually.

Key points:

dir attribute can be "ltr" or "rtl".

It’s more forceful than <bdi> (Bi-Directional Isolation), which only protects a text segment from surrounding direction changes—it doesn’t reverse it.

Often used in multilingual documents where a sequence of characters must display in a specific, non-default order.

If you like, I can give you a visual before-and-after demo of <bdo> in action.

Here’s a small visual demo of how <bdo> works.

HTML Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>BDO Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Without &lt;bdo&gt;:</h2>
    <p>English 1234 مرحبا</p>

    <h2>With &lt;bdo dir="rtl"&gt;:</h2>
    <p><bdo dir="rtl">English 1234 مرحبا</bdo></p>

    <h2>With &lt;bdo dir="ltr"&gt; (forced left-to-right):</h2>
    <p><bdo dir="ltr">مرحبا 1234 English</bdo></p>
</body>
</html>
What you’ll see if you open it in a browser:

Without <bdo> → The browser uses its default rules:

English reads LTR.

Arabic (مرحبا) reads RTL.

Numbers often match the surrounding text direction.

With <bdo dir="rtl"> → The entire line is forced to render right-to-left, so even the English and numbers appear reversed visually.

With <bdo dir="ltr"> → Everything is forced into left-to-right order, even the Arabic word.

If you want, I can also mock this up with screenshots so you can see exactly how the rendering changes without needing to run it yourself.
