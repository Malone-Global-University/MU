How do I make a website that is hosted on neocities that others can edit or modify? I want something separate from my own accounts so do not care about security.

If you want a publicly editable website on Neocities, that‚Äôs tricky because Neocities doesn‚Äôt natively allow ‚Äúanyone can edit‚Äù sites ‚Äî every site is tied to a single account, and file uploads happen through that account‚Äôs dashboard or API.

But there are a few ways you can simulate a ‚Äúcollaborative‚Äù website:

Option 1: Shared Neocities Account
Make a new Neocities account just for this collaborative site.

Share the login credentials with everyone you want to give editing access.

Anyone can log in, upload HTML/CSS/JS, and modify files directly.

Downside: No version history, so changes can be overwritten without warning.

Option 2: GitHub ‚Üí Neocities Sync
Create a GitHub repository where people can contribute via Pull Requests (or just directly commit if you don‚Äôt care about moderation).

Use a small script or GitHub Action to automatically upload changes from GitHub to Neocities via their API.

This way:

People edit on GitHub.

Site automatically updates on Neocities.

GitHub keeps version history.

Downside: Slightly more setup, but way safer for collaboration.

Option 3: Embed a Public Editor
If you want live, in-browser editing:

Use a JS-based collaborative editor like Etherpad Lite or CodeMirror in Firebase.

Host that editor inside your Neocities site in an <iframe> pointing to the collaborative tool (which is hosted somewhere else, because Neocities can‚Äôt run server code).

Have the tool export HTML that you (or a bot) manually upload to Neocities.

Downside: Not fully automatic without a bridge script.

Option 4: Treat the Site as a Public Pastebin
Host a static HTML file on Neocities that loads its content from a third-party service (Google Docs published to web, Pastebin raw links, etc.).

Anyone edits the Google Doc, and the Neocities page pulls that live content via JavaScript.

Downside: Can break if third-party host changes or removes files.

üí° Quick & Dirty Method (Fastest)

Create a new Neocities account.

Share the login/password.

Let people edit directly through the Neocities dashboard.
No extra tech, but expect chaos ‚Äî people can accidentally delete everything.

If you want, I can give you step-by-step instructions for setting up Option 2 (GitHub ‚Üí Neocities) so you still get ‚Äúanyone can edit‚Äù but with a safety net.
That would let strangers edit without them touching your Neocities login at all.
