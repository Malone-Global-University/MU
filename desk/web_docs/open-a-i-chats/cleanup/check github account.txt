how do I check which account is pushing my files to github from terminal?
ChatGPT said:
In your terminal, you can check which GitHub account is being used to push in a few different ways — it depends on whether you’re using HTTPS or SSH for Git.

1️⃣ Check the remote URL for your repo
Run inside your project folder:

git remote -v
If the URL looks like https://github.com/username/repo.git, the username there is the account tied to pushes when you authenticate.

If it looks like git@github.com:username/repo.git, the username there is the repo owner, but the actual GitHub account used depends on which SSH key is loaded.

2️⃣ If using HTTPS — see stored credentials

git config --global credential.helper
Then, depending on your OS:

Windows: Search Credential Manager → Windows Credentials → find github.com.

macOS: Open Keychain Access → search github.com.

Linux: May be in your credential manager (e.g., libsecret).

3️⃣ If using SSH — see which key is used

ssh -T git@github.com
GitHub will reply with:

Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated...
That <username> is the GitHub account being used for pushes.

4️⃣ Check Git’s configured username/email

git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
or for just this repo:

git config user.name
git config user.email
(These don’t control authentication, but they do affect commit authorship.)

If you want, I can give you a one-liner that will immediately tell you which GitHub account is authenticated in your current repo. That would save you from checking multiple places. Would you like me to do that?

I see the issue — your terminal output says:

Your remote URL is:

https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/Malone-Global-University.git
Your SSH authentication test logged in as:

EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC
…but your recent commits in GitHub are showing under the account/organization ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC.

That mismatch usually means you’re not actually pushing to the repo you think you are or you have two similar repos in different orgs and switched them.

Likely causes:
Two remotes or two clones
You may have one local folder pointing to EPSILON, another pointing to ALPHA, and you worked in the ALPHA one without realizing.

Check all remotes in your folder:

git remote -v
If you see only the EPSILON one here but your pushes appear in ALPHA, you may have been inside a different folder when pushing.

Multiple GitHub accounts with cached credentials
Even though your git remote shows the EPSILON repo, if you push over HTTPS, Git might use cached credentials for ALPHA (if stored in Windows Credential Manager).

On Windows, open Credential Manager → Windows Credentials → remove any github.com entries, then push again — it will prompt for the correct account.

You forked and are pushing to the fork
If the ALPHA repo is a fork of EPSILON or vice versa, pushes could be going to the fork's URL instead of the one you expect.

How to confirm 100% which account is pushing
Run inside the repo folder:

git remote get-url origin
Then:

git push --dry-run --verbose
This will show the exact URL and account being used for the push, without actually changing anything.

If you want, I can walk you through forcing this repo to always push to EPSILON and making sure your credentials match the EPSILON account so ALPHA never gets touched accidentally. That will prevent these cross-account pushes.

You said:
PS C:\mgu> git remote get-url origin
https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/Malone-Global-University.git
PS C:\mgu> git push --dry-run --verbose
Pushing to https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/Malone-Global-University.git
To https://github.com/EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC/Malone-Global-University.git
 = [up to date]      main -> main
Everything up-to-date
PS C:\mgu>
ChatGPT said:
Okay — that confirms your C:\mgu folder is indeed set up to push to the EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC repo, not ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC.

So if commits are appearing in ALPHA-GROUP-MRELLC, that means:

Either you made those commits from a different local clone that points to the ALPHA repo.

Or you worked in C:\mgu at one point when its origin remote was still set to ALPHA, then later changed it to EPSILON — meaning older pushes went to ALPHA.

How to confirm if you have another clone pointing to ALPHA:

Run this in PowerShell to search all folders for .git/config and see the remotes:

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Directory -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Include ".git" | ForEach-Object {
    $config = Join-Path $_.FullName "config"
    if (Test-Path $config) {
        Write-Host "Repo:" $_.FullName
        Select-String -Path $config -Pattern "url ="
    }
}
This will list every local repo and the remote URL it’s tied to.

If you want, I can also give you a quick “account lock” setup so that your C:\mgu repo can only push to EPSILON, making accidental ALPHA pushes impossible. That way you won't get cross-account commit confusion again.

Do you want me to set that up for you?

netlify says Awaiting External DNS
ChatGPT said:
"Awaiting External DNS" in Netlify means Netlify is ready to host your site, but it’s waiting for your domain’s DNS records to point to their servers.

Since you’ve been using Cloudflare for your DNS, the fix is usually one of these:

1️⃣ Make sure your domain’s nameservers are set to Cloudflare
In your domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.), confirm the nameservers are Cloudflare’s, not Netlify’s.

Netlify should not be your DNS provider in this setup — Cloudflare will handle DNS, and you’ll just add the correct CNAME/ALIAS records pointing to Netlify.

2️⃣ Add the correct DNS records in Cloudflare
In your Cloudflare DNS settings for the domain:

If this is a root domain (example.com):

Add an A record:

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
Proxy status: DNS only (grey cloud)
Add another A record:

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 99.83.229.113
Proxy status: DNS only (grey cloud)
If this is a www subdomain (www.example.com):

Add a CNAME record:

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
Proxy status: DNS only (grey cloud)
(Netlify gives you these IPs and target URLs in the Domain Settings → Custom domains section.)

3️⃣ Turn off Cloudflare proxy for Netlify records
The orange cloud in Cloudflare can cause SSL or redirect loops with Netlify.

For Netlify records, set Proxy status to DNS only (grey cloud).

4️⃣ Wait for DNS propagation
DNS changes can take anywhere from 5 minutes to a few hours.

You can check propagation with:

nslookup yourdomain.com
or use https://dnschecker.org.

If you want, I can walk you through exactly which records to add in Cloudflare for your maloneuniversity.org setup so Netlify clears that "Awaiting External DNS" state. That way there’s no guesswork.

Do you want me to do that for your domain?

I see what’s going wrong — it’s actually two separate Git mistakes here.

1️⃣ The git commit command syntax is wrong
You’re writing:

git commit "added static folders"
But Git interprets "added static folders" as a file path (which doesn’t exist), not as a commit message.

Correct syntax:

git commit -m "added static folders"
The -m flag tells Git that what follows is a message, not a file name.

2️⃣ The git push command syntax is wrong
You wrote:

git push main
But Git interprets main there as the remote name (which you don’t have), not the branch name.

To push your local main branch to the origin remote, use:

git push origin main
or simply:

git push
(since you’re already on main and it’s tracking origin/main).

3️⃣ How to fix this right now
Here’s the full sequence for your situation:

git add .
git commit -m "added static folders"
git push origin main
That should:

Stage all the new/changed files

Create a commit with the correct message

Push it to your GitHub repo in EPSILON-GROUP-MRELLC

If you want, I can give you a PowerShell alias so even if you forget the -m or write git push main wrong, it’ll still “just work” without throwing errors. That could save you a lot of typing headaches.
