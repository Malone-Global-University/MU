pushed to github incorrectly. Netlify is failing deploys.

Got it — sounds like your GitHub repo has the wrong version of your files, which is breaking Netlify builds. Since you mentioned before that your local repo is the correct one, we can fix this by forcing GitHub to match your local files. Here’s a careful, step-by-step approach:

1️⃣ Make sure you’re on the correct branch locally
git checkout main
git status


Confirm all your local changes are committed. If not:

git add .
git commit -m "Save local changes before force push"

2️⃣ Force push your local branch to GitHub

Warning: This will overwrite GitHub with your local repo. Anything on GitHub not in your local repo will be lost.

git push origin main --force


This tells Git to replace the remote main branch with your local version.

3️⃣ Verify GitHub

Go to your GitHub repo and make sure your files match your local copy.

4️⃣ Trigger Netlify deploy

Netlify will automatically detect the push. If it doesn’t:

Go to your site in Netlify.

Click Deploys → Trigger deploy → Clear cache and deploy site (to ensure it uses the new commit).

If you want, I can give you a safer method that backs up the current GitHub repo before overwriting it, just in case something goes wrong.

Do you want me to do that?
