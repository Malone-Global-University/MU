how many html tags are there?
ChatGPT said:

You're asking a surprisingly nuanced question—as the exact number of HTML tags can vary depending on the version of HTML you're referring to and what you count as a "tag."

Here's what current reputable sources say:

Around 145 tags are listed in some HTML5 resources. For instance, TechAltum states that the latest version of HTML (i.e., HTML5) includes 145 tags 
Tech Altum Tutorial
.

Some sources place the count at approximately 110 tags, noting that HTML5 introduced around 32 new ones 
Huda Tutorials
.

Another source mentions roughly 140 tags in HTML5 
Codedamn
.

A Reddit thread reveals that even among developers, responses vary widely—from claims like "only <html> is a tag" (technically correct, but more of a riddle) to estimates above 100, and even acknowledging "unlimited" when including HTML custom elements (web components) 
Reddit
.

Why the Discrepancy?

What counts as a “tag”? Do you include obsolete or deprecated tags (like <font> or <center>), or only those current in HTML5? Some lists include DOCTYPE, void elements, and specialized tags like <template>.

Definition variances: Some sources may only count unique tag names (like <div>, <p>) but may or may not include self-closing or void tags.

Living Standard complexity: The WHATWG’s HTML standard is a constantly evolving (living) document, making the total number fluid

Source/Estimate	Approximate Count	Notes
TechAltum (HTML5 latest)	145 tags	Includes all tags defined in HTML5

Huda Tutorials (HTML5)	~110 tags	Notes 32 of them were newly introduced in HTML5

Codedamn article	~140 tags	General estimate

Reddit developer conversations	Variable (20–100+, even "unlimited")	Reflects real-world ambiguity and inclusion of web components 
Reddit
Final Thought

If you're building to spec and want a solid number for HTML5, 145 is a reasonable and frequently cited figure, especially if it includes deprecated elements. However, if you're focusing on modern, semantic, and actively used tags, estimates like 110–140 are more likely accurate. The number continues to evolve as standards grow and web components extend the set.

Let me know if you'd like a list of those tags, filtered by category, or details on deprecated versus modern ones!

list in order of introduction
ChatGPT said:

Great question! The history of HTML spans several versions, and different tags were introduced at different times. While there isn’t a single definitive source that lists every HTML tag in the exact order they were introduced, we can piece together a solid overview by tracing the evolution of HTML versions and their key milestones.

1. HTML 1.0 (1991–1993) – Tim Berners-Lee’s Original Set

Introduced: First publicly available description of HTML by Tim Berners-Lee ~1991–1993 
Wikipedia
Content Snare
.

Approximately 18 tags, including:

Structural & text: headings, paragraphs (<h1>–<h6>, <p>)

Formatting: bold, italic

Lists, hyperlinks, images

This formed the core foundation of web document structure 
Content Snare
Wikipedia
.

2. HTML 2.0 (1995) – Standardization

Released in 1995 by IETF to standardize web markup as usage grew 
Content Snare
.

It refined the existing tag set and added broader compatibility, but didn’t add many radically new tags; instead, it solidified support across browsers.

3. HTML 3.2 and 4.01 (Late 1990s)

While not tracked in detail here, HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.01 brought significant enhancements:

Layout and presentation tags (e.g., tables, forms)

Greater control over document presentation

Widespread browser adherence following their recommendation in December 1999

.

4. HTML5 – The Big Leap (2008–2014)

First public draft released in January 2008

Became a W3C Recommendation in October 2014
