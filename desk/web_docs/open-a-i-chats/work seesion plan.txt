Here’s a good plan of attack for your 8/23 work session — ordered so dependencies don’t block you:

✅ Phase 1: Core Pipeline Tests

Test markdown-html converter

Feed in different .md files (short/long, with links, images, code blocks).

Check output HTML is clean, styled, and links resolve.

Test index generator

Verify it picks up new files, updates metadata, and outputs consistent registry.html.

Make sure orphaned or deleted files don’t stay in the index.

Test lesson generator

Try simple math/English lessons.

Confirm linear navigation (Prev / Next / Home) works.

✅ Phase 2: Dictionary System

Build a JSON registry for the dictionary entry generator

Schema: { "word": "convivial", "definition": "...", "examples": [...], "related": [...] }.

Test dictionary entry generator

Input a few words, output HTML using schema.

Confirm meta tags, breadcrumbs, and styling match the site.

Build a template for dictionary entries

Consistent structure: header, definition, usage, synonyms, “view entry” link.

Test template for dictionary entries

Run with 2–3 test words.

Verify formatting doesn’t break across browsers.

✅ Phase 3: Search

Build site-wide search

JSON index or Lunr.js-style search across pages.

Test with dictionary, wiki, encyclopedia, blog.

Build a dictionary search

Narrow scope to dictionary/ folder.

Build a wiki search

Narrow scope to wiki/ folder.

Build an encyclopedia search

Narrow scope to encyclopedia/ folder.

✅ Phase 4: Content Templates

Build a template for worklog

Auto-stamp date/time.

Simple bullet-point format (tasks, progress, blockers).

Build a template for a development blog

Includes title, date, summary, body, tags.

Ensure blog entries auto-register in a blog-index.html.

⚡ Suggested order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13.
This way, you validate core converters before layering in the registry/search/template systems.

Want me to draft the JSON schema for the dictionary registry (#4) so you can immediately plug it into the entry generator?

Perfect — here’s a clean JSON schema you can use as the dictionary registry foundation. It’s structured so the generator can reliably pull definitions, examples, and metadata:

{
  "dictionary": [
    {
      "word": "convivial",
      "partOfSpeech": "adjective",
      "definition": "Friendly, lively, and enjoyable; relating to a cheerful, sociable atmosphere.",
      "examples": [
        "The party had a convivial atmosphere, with laughter and music filling the room.",
        "She was known for her convivial personality that made everyone feel welcome."
      ],
      "synonyms": ["sociable", "jovial", "genial", "festive"],
      "antonyms": ["gloomy", "unsociable", "morose"],
      "relatedTopics": ["hospitality", "community", "friendship"],
      "etymology": "From Latin 'convivium' meaning 'feast' or 'banquet'.",
      "lastUpdated": "2025-08-23T14:45:00Z"
    }
  ]
}

🔑 Notes

dictionary is an array → you can add more word objects.

word and definition are required for every entry.

examples, synonyms, antonyms, relatedTopics, and etymology are optional but recommended.

lastUpdated can help track when an entry was added/modified.

👉 Do you want me to also write the HTML generator template that would read this JSON and output a styled dictionary entry page (#10), or do you prefer to first expand the JSON registry with a few more sample entries?
