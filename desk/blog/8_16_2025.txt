Stayed up all night writing code. Fell asleep around 8:30 AM. Woke up around 11:32 AM to do errands. Came home and did some more code. Fell asleep again. Woke up at 8:30 PM. Tested html on JDoole. Many typos existed. I used CHATGPT to check code. It found and fixed broken syntax. JDoodle liked new code; no errors. Saved code and updated project folder. Made tweaks to python script to create index files in every folder of /departments/. Tested python v1 and v2 of python-departments-index-generator.py. Script was a success.


Before updating GitHub I want to make some final tweaks to make sure all pages are linked and not orphaned
